Clinical presentations and the Salzburg EEG criteria for NCSE were used to identify patients with NCSE after CSE. Demographics, clinical features, and anti-epileptic treatment responses were collected and analyzed. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to evaluate three-month outcomes. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine independent prognostic factors.RESULTS: Among 145 consecutive patients with convulsive SE, 48 (33.1%) patents eventually evolved into NCSE. Two patients with cerebral anoxia were exclude. At three-month follow-up, 23 patients (50.0%) had mRS ≥ 3, and 16 (34.8%) died. Thirty-two patients (69.6%) were given continuous intravenous anesthetic drugs (CIVADs). Fourteen patients (30.4%) had CIVAD at the rate >50% proposed maximal dose (PMD). There was a single predictor factor found significant after multivariate logistic regression analysis: the recurrence of EEG seizures within two hours of initiation of CIVAD at a dose of greater than half the proposed maximal dose (OR, 9.63; 95%CI, 1.08-86.18; p = 0.043). The use of CIVAD, even with a high dose (>50% PMD), was not independently associated with unfavorable outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence of EEG seizures within two hours of initiation of CIVAD at a dose of greater than half the proposed maximal dose predicts unfavorable outcomes in NCSE after CSE. The refractoriness of the seizures might be a significantly greater risk for poor outcome in NCSE after CSE than treatment with CIVADs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

EEGs recorded in the ICU were classified using the Salzburg criteria for NCSE.RESULTS: only 23% (14/60) of the patients had NCSE confirmed by EEG. None of the semiological features could distinguish between patients with NCSE and those without. In both groups, the following phenomena were most common: discrete myoclonic muscle twitching and discrete tonic muscle activation. Besides these, automatisms and eye deviation were observed in both groups.CONCLUSION: subtle motor phenomena in critically ill patients can raise the suspicion of NCSE.

We implemented the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology, 2012 version (ACNS criteria) to increase the test performance of SCNC. In patients without preexisting epileptic encephalopathy, the following criteria were applied: (1) more than 25 epileptiform discharges (ED) per 10-second epoch, i.e., >2.5/s and (2) patients with EDs ≤ 2.5/s or rhythmic delta/theta activity (RDT) exceeding 0.5/s AND at least one of the additional criteria: (2a) clinical and EEG improvements from antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), (2b) subtle clinical phenomena, or (2c) typical spatiotemporal evolution. In case of fluctuation without evolution or EEG improvement without clinical improvement, \"possible NCSE\" was diagnosed. For identification of RDT, the following criteria were compared: (test condition A) continuous delta-theta activity without further rules, (B) ACNS criterion for rhythmic delta activity (RDA), and (C) ACNS criteria for RDA and fluctuation.RESULTS: False positive rate in controls dropped from 28% (condition A) to 2% (B) (p = 0.00039) and finally to 0% (C) (p = 0.000042).

Patients in deep coma may exhibit epileptiform EEG patterns, such as generalized periodic spikes, and there is an ongoing debate about the relationship of these patterns and NCSE. The purposes of this review are (i) to discuss the various EEG patterns found in coma, its fluctuations, and transitions and (ii) to propose modified criteria for NCSE in coma. Classical coma patterns such as diffuse polymorphic delta activity, spindle coma, alpha/theta coma, low output voltage, or burst suppression do not reflect NCSE. Any ictal patterns with a typical spatiotemporal evolution or epileptiform discharges faster than 2.5 Hz in a comatose patient reflect nonconvulsive seizures or NCSE and should be treated. Generalized periodic diacharges or lateralized periodic discharges (GPDs/LPDs) with a frequency of less than 2.5 Hz or rhythmic discharges (RDs) faster than 0.5 Hz are the borderland of NCSE in coma. In these cases, at least one of the additional criteria is needed to diagnose NCSE (a) subtle clinical ictal phenomena, (b) typical spatiotemporal evolution, or (c) response to antiepileptic drug treatment. There is currently no consensus about how long these patterns must be present to qualify for NCSE, and the distinction from nonconvulsive seizures in patients with critical illness or in comatose patients seems arbitrary.

To examine molecular mechanism of RHS6 for Th2 cytokine expression, we used DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA, intracellular cytokine staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation.RESULTS: Deletion of RHS6 caused a dramatic resistance to allergic airway inflammation. RHS6 recruited transcription factors GATA3, SATB1, and IRF4, which play important roles in expression of all three Th2 cytokine genes.

We herein show that phosphorylation of Gata3 at Ser308, Thr315 and Ser316 induces dissociation of a histone deacetylase Hdac2 from the Gata3/Chd4 repressive complex in Th2 cells. We also identify Akt1 as a Gata3-phosphorylating kinase, and the activation of Akt1 induces derepression of Tbx21 and Ifng expression in Th2 cells. Moreover, T-bet-dependent IFNγ expression in IFNγ-producing memory Th2 cells appears to be controlled by the phosphorylation status of Gata3 in human and murine systems.

Furthermore, GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2 differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. In this review, we present an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction. GATA3 may also directly act on the Ifng gene. In summary, GATA3 serves as a transcriptional activator or repressor through direct action on transcriptional machinery and/or affecting chromatin remodeling at many critical loci encoding cytokines, cytokine receptors, signaling molecules as well as transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of T(h)1 and T(h)2 differentiation."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation induces high levels of transcription of GATA3, a master regulator of Th2 cell differentiation, and enforced expression of GATA3 induces Th2 cytokine expression.", "answer_start": 187}], "question": "What is the role of Gata3 in Th2 cells?", "id": "5d36c0e37bc3fee31f00000b_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into Th2 cells is accompanied by chromatin remodeling and increased expression of a set of Th2-specific genes, including those encoding Th2 cytokines.

A genome-wide unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation assay coupled with massive parallel sequencing analysis revealed that GATA3 bound to 1279 genes selectively in Th2 cells, and 101 genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells.

The transcription of the 16 GATA3-nonresponding genes was clearly increased by the introduction of an active form of STAT6, STAT6VT.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that both factors bind distal sites at Tbx21 and that T-bet directly activates its own expression. We also show that in Th1 cells, GATA3 is distributed away from Th2 genes, instead occupying T-bet binding sites at Th1 genes, and that T-bet is sufficient to induce GATA3 binding at these sites.

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to four groups and received a single dose of inactivated influenza vaccine (fluvirin: 18 μg of haemagglutinin per H1N1 vaccine strain, 17 μg of haemagglutinin per H3N2 vaccine strain, and 15 μg of haemagglutinin per B vaccine strain) (1) by microneedle patch or (2) by intramuscular injection, or received (3) placebo by microneedle patch, all administered by an unmasked health-care worker; or received a single dose of (4) inactivated influenza vaccine by microneedle patch self-administered by study participants.

Primary safety outcome measures are the incidence of study product-related serious adverse events within 180 days, grade 3 solicited or unsolicited adverse events within 28 days, and solicited injection site and systemic reactogenicity on the day of study product administration through 7 days after administration, and secondary safety outcomes are new-onset chronic illnesses within 180 days and unsolicited adverse events within 28 days, all analysed by intention to treat. Secondary immunogenicity outcomes are antibody titres at day 28 and percentages of seroconversion and seroprotection, all determined by haemagglutination inhibition antibody assay.

There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, no treatment-related unsolicited grade 3 or higher adverse events, and no new-onset chronic illnesses. Among vaccinated groups (vaccine via health-care worker administered microneedle patch or intramuscular injection, or self-administered microneedle patch), overall incidence of solicited adverse events (n=89 vs n=73 vs n=73) and unsolicited adverse events (n=18 vs n=12 vs n=14) were similar. Reactogenicity was mild, transient, and most commonly reported as tenderness (15 [60%] of 25 participants [95% CI 39-79]) and pain (11 [44%] of 25 [24-65]) after intramuscular injection; and as tenderness (33 [66%] of 50 [51-79]), erythema (20 [40%] of 50 [26-55]), and pruritus (41 [82%] of 50 [69-91]) after vaccination by microneedle patch application.

Using time and location parameters, Google quantifies an internet query share (IQS) to measure the relative search volume for specific terms. We analyzed the correlation between IQS and laboratory and hospitalization data before and after national vaccine introductions.Results: There was a strong positive correlation between the rotavirus IQS and laboratory reports in the United States (R2 = 0.79) and United Kingdom (R2 = 0.60) and between the rotavirus IQS and acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations in the United States (R2 = 0.87) and Mexico (R2 = 0.69) (P < .0001 for all correlations).

Cases (n = 98) were patients who tested positive for rotavirus by immunochromatography; those who tested negative (n = 628) comprised the control group.

These cells, acquired non-invasively, represent a sample of highly relevant tumor tissue that is an alternative to difficult and low-yield tumor biopsies. In recent years, there has been growing interest in genomic profiling of CTCs to enable longitudinal monitoring of the tumor's adaptive response to therapy. However, due to their extreme rarity, genotyping CTCs has proved challenging. Relevant mutations can be masked by leukocyte contamination in isolates. Heterogeneity between subpopulations of tumor cells poses an additional obstacle. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing can overcome these limitations but isolation of single CTCs is prone to cell loss and is prohibitively difficult and time consuming. To address these limitations, we developed a single cell sample preparation and genome sequencing pipeline that combines biophysical enrichment and single cell isolation using laser capture microdissection (LCM). A key component of this process is the encapsulation of enriched CTC sample in a hydrogel matrix, which enhances the efficiency of single-cell isolation by LCM, and is compatible with downstream sequencing. We validated this process by sequencing of single CTCs and cell free DNA (cfDNA) from a single patient with castration resistant prostate cancer. Identical mutations were observed in prostate cancer driver genes (TP53, PTEN, FOXA1) in both single CTCs and cfDNA. However, two independently isolated CTCs also had identical missense mutations in the genes for ATR serine/threonine kinase, KMT2C histone methyltransferase, and FANCC DNA damage repair gene.

The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of T/T based upon the CS.

The AC considered the survival benefit of T/T clinically meaningful although relatively small. The ERG highlighted that none of the participants in the phase II trial and approximately half of the RECOURSE participants (394 of 800) were from Europe, which might limit the applicability of the study findings to the NHS. Moreover, the ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns that resulted in 11 adjustments to the company's base-case analysis. The ERG adjustments that had the largest impact were using the RECOURSE trial data only (instead of the pooled evidence), fixing errors and violations and using the utilities from the CORRECT trial (identified in the literature review) only. The ERG preferred to use the RECOURSE trial data only given the suboptimal methodology used by the company to pool the evidence. However, since there were no fundamental arguments to prevent the two trials from being pooled, the ERG also presented its base-case analysis based on the pooled effectiveness estimates. The company base-case resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £44,032 per QALY gained while the ERG base-case resulted in ICERs of £52,695 and £49,392 per QALY gained based on the RECOURSE trial only and pooled evidence, respectively.

Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and cine images were performed to evaluate myocardial fibrosis, regional wall motion, longitudinal myocardial function, global function and volumetry of both ventricles.

Segmental wall motion abnormalities correlated strongly with the degree of enhancement. Myocardial enhancement was associated with conduction abnormalities. Sixty-nine percent of our asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients showed mild ventricular dilatation, systolic failure or both in global ventricular analysis.

One example is genomic imprinting, which is defined as parent-of-origin mono-allelic gene expression. Imprinting is established largely due to epigenetic differences arriving in the zygote from sperm and egg haploid genomes. In the mouse, there are approximately 150 known imprinted genes, many of which occur in imprinted gene clusters that are regulated together. One imprinted cluster includes the maternally expressed Igf2r, Slc22a2, and Slc22a3 genes and the paternally expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Airn. Although it is known that Igf2r and Airn are reciprocally imprinted, the timing of imprinted expression and accompanying epigenetic changes have not been well characterized in vivo.RESULTS: Here we show lineage- and temporal-specific regulation of DNA methylation and histone modifications at the Igf2r/Airn locus correlating with differential establishment of imprinted expression during gastrulation. Our results show that Igf2r is expressed from both alleles in the E6.5 epiblast. After gastrulation commences, the locus becomes imprinted in the embryonic lineage with the lncRNA Airn expressed from the paternal allele and Igf2r restricted to maternal allele expression. We document differentially enriched allele-specific histone modifications in extraembryonic and embryonic tissues. We also document for the first time allele-specific spreading of DNA methylation during gastrulation concurrent with establishment of imprinted expression of Igf2r.

In mouse, the antisense long noncoding (lnc) RNA Airn, which is paternally expressed from the differentially methylated region (DMR) in the second intron of Igf2r, is required to silence the paternal Igf2r. In opossum, however, intriguingly, the DMR was reported to be in a different downstream intron (intron 11) and there was no antisense lncRNA detected in previous analyses. Therefore, clarifying the imprinting mechanism of marsupial IGF2R is of great relevance for understanding the origin and evolution of genomic imprinting in the IGF2R locus. Thus, the antisense lncRNA associated with the marsupial DMR can be considered as the 'missing link'. In this study, we identified a novel antisense lncRNA, ALID, after detailed analysis of the IGF2R locus in an Australian marsupial, the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, and compared it to that of the grey short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica.RESULTS: Tammar IGF2R showed maternal expression and had a maternally methylated CpG island (CGI) in intron 12 as well as a promoter CGI without differential methylation, but none in the second intron. Re-analysis of the IGF2R of opossum detected the CGI in intron 12, not intron 11, as previously reported, confirming that the DMR in intron 12 is conserved between these marsupials and so is the putative imprinting control region of marsupial IGF2R. ALID is paternally expressed from the middle of the DMR and is approximately 650 bp long with a single exon structure that is extremely short compared to Airn. Hence, the lncRNA transcriptional overlap of the IGF2R promoter, which is essential for the Igf2r silencing in the mouse, is likely absent in tammar. This suggests that fundamental differences in the lncRNA-based silencing mechanisms evolved in eutherian and marsupial IGF2R and may reflect the lack of differential methylation in the promoter CGI of marsupial IGF2R.CONCLUSIONS: Our study thus provides the best candidate factor for establishing paternal silencing of marsupial IGF2R without transcriptional overlap, which is distinct from the Igf2r silencing mechanism of Airn, but which may be analogous to the mode of action for the flanking Slc22a2 and Slc22a3 gene silencing in the mouse placenta."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways.

Promising information that will empower prevention of common complex diseases and ensure better quality of life is conflated with promising greater access to personal information. The presence and absence of scientific legitimacy is related to concerns about accuracy and validity on the one side, and fears of paternalism and elitism on the other. Nevertheless, a common strategy uniting these different styles of personalisation is consumer empowerment.

One of the significant challenges of direct-to-consumer testing is that it shifts the control of genetic testing from the clinical domain and medical professionals into the hands of consumers. No longer is genetic testing being carried out solely for medical reasons, by specialists in clinical genetics. Testing is now being used to empower consumers and can be used 'to shed new light on your distant ancestors, your close family and most of all, yourself' (23andMe).

Patients and Methods : A total of 1811 patients with non-metastatic NPC treated with IMRT (with or without chemotherapy) between October 2009 and February 2012 at our center were involved for building the nomograms. Nomograms for LR-free rate and RR-free rate at 3- and 5- year were generated as visualizations of Cox proportional hazards regression models, and validated using bootstrap resampling, estimating discrimination and calibration. Results: With a median follow up of 49.50 months, the 3- and 5- year LR-free rate were 95.43% and 94.30% respectively; the 3- and 5- year RR-free rate were 95.94% and 95.41% respectively. The final predictive model for LR included age, the neutrophil/leukocyte ratio (NWR), pathological type, primary gross tumor volume, maxillary sinus invasion, ethmoidal sinus invasion and lacerated foramen invasion; the model for RR involved NWR, plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA copy number, cervical lymph node volume and N category. The models showed fairly good discriminatory ability with concordance indices (c-indices) of 0.76 and 0.74 for predicting LR and RR, respectively, as well as good calibration. The proposed stratification of risk groups based on the nomograms allowed significant distinction between Kaplan-Meier curves for LR and RR.

Angiotensin (Ang) II, the most active metabolite of the renin-angiotensin system, plays an outstanding role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and vascular injury. Activation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has shown to attenuate devastating effects of Ang II in the cardiovascular system by reducing Ang II degradation and increasing Ang-(1-7) generation leading to Mas receptor activation. Recent Advances: Activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis reduces hypertension and improves vascular injury mainly through an increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreased reactive oxygen species production. Recent studies reported that shedding of the enzymatically active ectodomain of ACE2 from the cell surface seems to regulate its activity and serves as an interorgan communicator in cardiovascular disease. In addition, collectrin, an ACE2 homolog with no catalytic activity, regulates blood pressure through an NO-dependent mechanism.CRITICAL ISSUES: Large body of experimental data confirmed sustained beneficial effects of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis activation on hypertension and vascular injury. Experimental studies also suggest that activation of collectrin might be beneficial in hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. Their role in clinical hypertension is unclear as selective and reliable activators of both axes are not yet available.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: This review will highlight the results of recent research progress that illustrate the role of both ACE and collectrin in the modulation of NO and oxidative stress in blood pressure homeostasis and vascular injury, providing evidence for the potential therapeutic application of ACE2 and collectrin in hypertension and vascular disease.

ACE2 enzymatic activity and protein can be detected in biological fluids, including urine, plasma, and conditioned cell culture media. We present a detailed method for measurement of ACE2 activity in biological fluids, using hydrolysis of an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic ACE2 substrate, in the absence or presence of the ACE2 inhibitors MLN-4760 or DX600. Recombinant human or mouse ACE2 is used to generate standard curves for this assay, with ACE2 detection ranging from 1.56 to 50 ng/ml.

Classical AS is a progressive renal disease presenting with a triad of progressive hematuric nephritis and typical extra-renal complications, such as sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and variable ocular anomalies. The mode of inheritance in AS is X-linked in 85%, autosomal recessive in 15%, and autosomal dominant in rare cases.OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify underlying mutation in multiple individuals from a large consanguineous Saudi family with inherited nephropathy, including our index patient who manifested all the features of classical AS.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were diagnosed by nephrologists and clinical geneticists. All the individuals underwent clinical, audiological and ophthalmological evaluation. Blood samples were collected after written informed consent. DNA extraction, homozygosity mapping and PCR amplification followed standard methodologies.RESULTS: The disease locus was mapped to 2q36.3, where both COL4A3 and COL4A4 reside. Sanger sequencing of COL4A3 and COL4A4 revealed an underlying novel homozygous disease-causing COL4A4 mutation (c.2420delG; p.G807fsX60) in the affected proband. Considerable phenotypic variability segregating with this COL4A4 mutation in our study family is documented. The homozygous mutants were manifesting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in their adolescence, while the heterozygous carrier members were presenting with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity ranging from intermittent hematuria to late onset ESRD. In addition, there is a relatively severe involvement of the ear (SNHL) and eye in the homozygotes than the heterozygotes. Fertility problems were also noted in both of the homozygous females.CONCLUSION: Identification of the causative mutation is an efficient strategy for conclusive molecular diagnosis in the patients and to establish genotype/phenotype correlation. It is important to study and evaluate asymptomatic carriers, to predict prognosis of the disease and to obviate the need for another renal biopsy in at-risk related family members. While an accurate genetic diagnosis of AS provides valuable information for genetic counseling in the extended family members, it can also facilitate future prenatal diagnosis and planning for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This change repositions DSB hotspots and completely restores fertility in male hybrids. Here we show that alteration of one Prdm9 allele impacts the behaviour of DSBs controlled by the other allele at chromosome-wide scales. These effects correlate strongly with the degree to which each PRDM9 variant binds both homologues at the DSB sites it controls. Furthermore, higher genome-wide levels of such 'symmetric' PRDM9 binding associate with increasing fertility measures, and comparisons of individual hotspots suggest binding symmetry plays a downstream role in the recombination process.

In most mammals, the placement of genetic crossovers is determined by the binding of PRDM9, a highly polymorphic protein with a long zinc finger array, to its cognate binding sites. It is one of over 800 genes encoding proteins with zinc finger domains in the human genome.RESULTS: We report a novel technique, Affinity-seq, that for the first time identifies both the genome-wide binding sites of DNA-binding proteins and quantitates their relative affinities. We have applied this in vitro technique to PRDM9, the zinc-finger protein that activates genetic recombination, obtaining new information on the regulation of hotspots, whose locations and activities determine the recombination landscape. We identified 31,770 binding sites in the mouse genome for the PRDM9(Dom2) variant. Comparing these results with hotspot usage in vivo, we find that less than half of potential PRDM9 binding sites are utilized in vivo. We show that hotspot usage is increased in actively transcribed genes and decreased in genomic regions containing H3K9me2/3 histone marks or bound to the nuclear lamina.CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a major factor determining whether a binding site will become an active hotspot and what its activity will be are constraints imposed by prior chromatin modifications on the ability of PRDM9 to bind to DNA in vivo.

In mammals, the Prdm9 gene, which encodes a meiosis-specific histone H3 methyltransferase, has recently been identified as a determinant of CO hotspots. Here, using transgenic mice, we show that the sole modification of PRDM9 zinc fingers leads to changes in hotspot activity, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) levels, and chromosome-wide distribution of COs. We further demonstrate by an in vitro assay that the PRDM9 variant associated with hotspot activity binds specifically to DNA sequences located at the center of the three hotspots tested. Remarkably, we show that mutations in cis located at hotspot centers and associated with a decrease of hotspot activity affect PRDM9 binding.

Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe human infections, but there are no approved antivirals to treat these infections. Development of nucleoside-based therapeutics for CoV infections has been hampered by the presence of a proofreading exoribonuclease. Here, we expand the known efficacy of the nucleotide prodrug remdesivir (GS-5734) to include a group β-2a CoV. Further, GS-5734 potently inhibits CoVs with intact proofreading. Following selection with the GS-5734 parent nucleoside, 2 amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 polymerase at residues that are identical across CoVs provide low-level resistance to GS-5734. The resistance mutations decrease viral fitness of MHV in vitro and attenuate pathogenesis in a SARS-CoV animal model of infection. Together, these studies define the target of GS-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of MHV and SARS-CoV, supporting further development of GS-5734 as a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " In non-human primates, early initiation of polymerase inhibitors favipiravir and remdesivir improves survival, but whether they could be effective in patients is unknown.", "answer_start": 110}], "question": "What is the target of the drug remdesivir?", "id": "5e6de3f21af46fc130000022_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Despite several clinical trials implemented, no antiviral drug could demonstrate efficacy against Ebola virus.

We estimate that favipiravir has a ~50% efficacy in blocking viral production, which results in reducing virus growth and cytokine storm while IFNα reduces cell susceptibility to infection.

The objective of this study was to examine the association between dental x-rays-the most common artificial source of ionizing radiation-and the risk of intracranial meningioma.METHODS: This population-based case-control study included 1433 patients who had intracranial meningioma diagnosed at ages 20 to 79 years and were residents of the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, the San Francisco Bay Area, and 8 counties in Houston, Texas between May 1, 2006 and April 28, 2011 (cases). A control group of 1350 individuals was frequency matched on age, sex, and geography (controls). The main outcome measure for the study was the association between a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma and self-reported bitewing, full-mouth, and panorex dental x-rays.RESULTS: Over a lifetime, cases were more than twice as likely as controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-2.9) to report having ever had a bitewing examination. Regardless of the age at which the films were obtained, individuals who reported receiving bitewing films on a yearly basis or with greater frequency had an elevated risk for ages <10 years (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8), ages 10 to 19 years (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0), ages 20 to 49 years (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.6), and ages ≥40 years (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0). An increased risk of meningioma also was associated with panorex films taken at a young age or on a yearly basis or with greater frequency, and individuals who reported receiving such films at ages <10 years had a 4.9 times increased risk (95% CI, 1.8-13.2) of meningioma. No association was appreciated for tumor location above or below the tentorium.CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to some dental x-rays performed in the past, when radiation exposure was greater than in the current era, appears to be associated with an increased risk of intracranial meningioma.

PRDM9 is required for fertility in mice, but little is known about its localization and developmental dynamics. Application of spermatogenic stage-specific markers demonstrates that PRDM9 accumulates in male germ cell nuclei at pre-leptonema to early leptonema but is no longer detectable in nuclei by late zygonema. By the pachytene stage, PRDM9-dependent histone H3K4 trimethyl marks on hotspots also disappear. PRDM9 localizes to nuclei concurrently with the deposition of meiotic cohesin complexes, but is not required for incorporation of cohesin complex proteins into chromosomal axial elements, or accumulation of normal numbers of RAD51 foci on meiotic chromatin by late zygonema. Germ cells lacking PRDM9 exhibit inefficient homology recognition and synapsis, with aberrant repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks and transcriptional abnormalities characteristic of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin.

This sets the stage for double-strand break (DSB) formation and reciprocal exchange of DNA between chromatids, forming Holliday junctions. Here we report genome-wide analyses of PRDM9-dependent histone modifications using two inbred mouse strains differing only in their PRDM9 zinc finger domain. We show that PRDM9 binding actively reorganizes nucleosomes into a symmetrical pattern, creating an extended nucleosome-depleted region. These regions are centered by a consensus PRDM9 binding motif, whose location and identity was confirmed in vitro. We also show that DSBs are centered over the PRDM9 binding motif within the nucleosome-depleted region. Combining these results with data from genetic crosses, we find that crossing-over is restricted to the region marked by H3K4me3.

We assessed the in vitro efficacies of combinations of SPR741 with conventional antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii Of 35 antibiotics tested, the MICs of 8 of them were reduced 32- to 8,000-fold against E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the presence of SPR741. The eight antibiotics, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, retapamulin, rifampin, and telithromycin, had diverse targets and mechanisms of action. Against A. baumannii, similar potentiation was achieved with clarithromycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, retapamulin, and rifampin. Susceptibility testing of the most effective antibiotic-SPR741 combinations was extended to 25 additional multidrug-resistant or clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae and 17 additional A. baumannii isolates in order to rank the potentiated antibiotics. SPR741 was also able to potentiate antibiotics that are substrates of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in E. coli, effectively circumventing the contribution of this pump to intrinsic antibiotic resistance. These studies support the further development of SPR741 in combination with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "MLL3 as part of activating signal cointegrator-2 -containing complex (ASCOM)", "answer_start": 680}], "question": "Is MLL3 part of the ASCOM complex?", "id": "5e6e2c1e7fc1ee872b000002_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The nuclear receptor Farnesoid x receptor (FXR) is a critical regulator of multiple genes involved in bile acid homeostasis. The coactivators attracted to promoters of FXR target genes and epigenetic modifications that occur after ligand binding to FXR have not been completely defined, and it is unknown whether these processes are disrupted during cholestasis. Using a microarray, we identified decreased expression of mixed lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3), a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) lysine methyl transferase at 1 and 3 days of post-common bile duct ligation (CBDL) in mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) analysis revealed that H3K4me3 of transporter promoters by MLL3 as part of activating signal cointegrator-2 -containing complex (ASCOM) is essential for activation of bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2), and sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) genes by FXR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Knockdown of nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCOA6) or MLL3/MLL4 mRNAs by small interfering RNA treatment led to a decrease in BSEP and NTCP mRNA levels in hepatoma cells. Human BSEP promoter transactivation by FXR/RXR was enhanced in a dose-dependent fashion by NCOA6 cDNA coexpression and decreased by AdsiNCOA6 infection in HepG2 cells. GST-pull down assays showed that domain 3 and 5 of NCOA6 (LXXLL motifs) interacted with FXR and that the interaction with domain 5 was enhanced by chenodeoxycholic acid. In vivo ChIP assays in HepG2 cells revealed ligand-dependent recruitment of ASCOM complex to FXR element in BSEP and GR element in NTCP promoters, respectively. ChIP analysis demonstrated significantly diminished recruitment of ASCOM complex components and H3K4me3 to Bsep and Mrp2 promoter FXR elements in mouse livers after CBDL.

Less commonly, a large deletion or a complex rearrangement involving the 7q36 region is associated with CS. We investigated the spectrum of MNX1 pathogenic variants and associated clinical features in the Korean patients with CS.METHODS: We enrolled 25 patients with CS, including 24 sporadic cases and one familial case. Direct sequencing of MNX1 and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were performed. We also analyzed clinical phenotypes and evaluated genotype-phenotype correlations.RESULTS: We identified six novel variants amongst a total of six null variants, one missense variant, and one large deletion. The null variants included four frameshift variants (p.Gly98Alafs* 124, p.Gly145Alafs*77, p.Gly151Leufs*67, and p.Ala216Profs*5) and two nonsense variants (p.Tyr186* and p.Gln212*). The missense variant, p.Lys295Gln, was located in the highly-conserved homeobox domain and was predicted to be deleterious. A large deletion involving the 7q36 region was detected in one patient. Pathogenic variants in MNX1 were detected in 28% of all CS cases and 25% of sporadic cases. The clinical phenotype was variable in patients with and without pathogenic variants; no significant genotype-phenotype correlation was observed.CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the spectrum and phenotypic variability of MNX1 pathogenic variants in the Korean population.© The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine"}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "BACKGROUND: The Currarino triad is a rare hereditary syndrome comprising anorectal malformation, sacral bony defect, and presacral mass.

The diagnosis is usually made during childhood and rarely in adulthood. In this context, imaging, and especially MRI plays a major role in the diagnosis of this syndrome. Surgical management is provided by pediatric surgeons or neurosurgeons.FAMILIAL CASE REPORT: Here, we present a family case report with CS requiring different neurosurgical management. The son, a 3-year-old boy, developed a tethered spinal cord syndrome associated to a lipoma of the filum terminale, a sacro-coccygeal teratoma and an anal adhesion. A combined surgical approach permitted a good evolution on the urinary and digestive functions despite a persistent fecal incontinence. The 2-year-old daughter presented with a cyst of the thyreoglossal tract infected and fistulized to the skin. She was also followed for a very small lipoma of the filum terminale that required a neurosurgical approach. The father, 44-year-old, manifested functional digestive and urinary disorders caused by a giant anterior sacral meningocele. The ligation of the neck of the cyst and aspiration of the liquid inside in full through a posterior partial approach permit a complete collapse of the cyst with an instantly satisfactory clinical outcome.CONCLUSION: In these cases, cooperation between pediatric surgeons and neurosurgeons was crucial. The follow-up of these patients should be done in a spina bifida clinic. A geneticist evaluation must be offered to the patient in the case of a CS as well as a clinical evaluation of the relatives (parents, siblings).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Highly complex GRHL2 expression patterns indicative of both reduced and elevated GRHL2 expression in tumours, possibly reflecting potential tumour-suppressing as well as oncogenic functions of GRHL2 in distinct human tumours, were observed. A dysregulation of GRHL2 expression for the first time was found in tumours of non-epithelial origin (e.g., astrocytomas, melanomas).

To identify genes involved in MeCP2 silencing, we screened a library of 60,000 shRNAs using a cell line with a MeCP2 reporter on the Xi and found 30 genes clustered in seven functional groups.

Pairs of independent insertions into seven genomic loci accounted for 14 of these insertions.

In each case, insertion was at position -16 or -17 relative to the 5' end of one of seven different tRNA genes.

Techniques to reduce these consequences may improve outcomes.METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients undergoing lumbar discectomy for single-level herniated disk at 2 institutions were followed prospectively with clinical and radiographic evaluations at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (control cohort). A second consecutive cohort of 30 patients undergoing 31 lumbar discectomies with implantation of an annular closure device was followed similarly. Incidence of recurrent disk herniation, disk height loss, the leg and back pain visual analog scale (VAS), and the Oswestry Disability Index were assessed at each follow-up.RESULTS: Cohorts were well matched at baseline. By 2 years of follow-up, symptomatic recurrent same-level disk herniation occurred in 3 (6.5%) patients in the control cohort versus 0 (0%) patients in the annular repair cohort (P=0.27). A trend of greater preservation of disk height was observed in the annular repair versus the control cohort 3 months (7.9 vs. 7.27 mm, P=0.08), 6 months (7.81 vs. 7.18 mm, P=0.09), and 12 months (7.63 vs. 6.9 mm, P=0.06) postoperatively. The annular closure cohort reported less leg pain (VAS-LP: 5 vs. 16, P<0.01), back pain (VAS-BP: 13 vs. 22, P<0.05), and disability (Oswestry Disability Index: 16 vs. 22, P<0.05) 1 year postoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of a novel annular repair device was associated with greater maintenance of disk height and improved 1-year leg pain, back pain, and low-back disability.

We assessed the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a candidate tuberculosis vaccine, modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A), in adults infected with HIV-1.METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of MVA85A in adults infected with HIV-1, at two clinical sites, in Cape Town, South Africa and Dakar, Senegal. Eligible participants were aged 18-50 years, had no evidence of active tuberculosis, and had baseline CD4 counts greater than 350 cells per μL if they had never received antiretroviral therapy or greater than 300 cells per μL (and with undetectable viral load before randomisation) if they were receiving antiretroviral therapy; participants with latent tuberculosis infection were eligible if they had completed at least 5 months of isoniazid preventive therapy, unless they had completed treatment for tuberculosis disease within 3 years before randomisation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four by randomly generated sequence to receive two intradermal injections of either MVA85A or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by antiretroviral therapy status and study site. Participants, nurses, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to group allocation. The second (booster) injection of MVA85A or placebo was given 6-12 months after the first vaccination. The primary study outcome was safety in all vaccinated participants (the safety analysis population). Safety was assessed throughout the trial as defined in the protocol. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease, assessed in the per-protocol population. Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset of participants at day 7 and day 28 after the first and second vaccination, and M tuberculosis infection and disease were assessed at the end of the study. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01151189.FINDINGS: Between Aug 4, 2011, and April 24, 2013, 650 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned; 649 were included in the safety analysis (324 in the MVA85A group and 325 in the placebo group) and 645 in the per-protocol analysis (320 and 325). 513 (71%) participants had CD4 counts greater than 300 cells per μL and were receiving antiretroviral therapy; 136 (21%) had CD4 counts above 350 cells per μL and had never received antiretroviral therapy. 277 (43%) had received isoniazid prophylaxis before enrolment. Solicited adverse events were more frequent in participants who received MVA85A (288 [89%]) than in those given placebo (235 [72%]). 34 serious adverse events were reported, 17 (5%) in each group. MVA85A induced a significant increase in antigen 85A-specific T-cell response, which peaked 7 days after both vaccinations and was primarily monofunctional. The number of participants with negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube findings at baseline who converted to positive by the end of the study was 38 (20%) of 186 in the MVA85A group and 40 (23%) of 173 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 11·7% (95% CI -41·3 to 44·9). In the per-protocol population, six (2%) cases of tuberculosis disease occurred in the MVA85A group and nine (3%) occurred in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 32·8% (95% CI -111·5 to 80·3).INTERPRETATION: MVA85A was well tolerated and immunogenic in adults infected with HIV-1. However, we detected no efficacy against M tuberculosis infection or disease, although the study was underpowered to detect an effect against disease.

To unravel BRAFi resistance mechanisms we have performed gene expression and mass spectrometry based proteome profiling of the sensitive parental A375 BRAF V600E-mutated human melanoma cell line and of daughter cell lines with induced BRAFi resistance. Increased expression of two novel resistance candidates, aminopeptidase-N (CD13/ANPEP) and ETS transcription factor FLI1 was observed in the BRAFi-resistant daughter cell lines. In addition, increased levels of the previously reported resistance mediators, receptor tyrosine kinase ephrine receptor A2 (EPHA2) and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET were also identified. The expression of these proteins was assessed in matched tumor samples from melanoma patients obtained before BRAFi and after disease progression. MET was overexpressed in all progression samples while the expression of the other candidates varied between the individual patients. Targeting CD13/ANPEP by a blocking antibody induced apoptosis in both parental A375- and BRAFi-resistant daughter cells as well as in melanoma cells with intrinsic BRAFi resistance and led to dephosphorylation of EPHA2 on S897, previously demonstrated to cause inhibition of the migratory capacity. AKT and RSK, both reported to induce EPHA2 S897 phosphorylation, were also dephosphorylated after inhibition of CD13/ANPEP.

Collagen type VI (COL VI) is upregulated in renal fibrosis. Endotrophin is released from COL VI and promotes pleiotropic pro-fibrotic effects. Kidney disease severity varies considerably and accurate information regarding CKD progression may improve clinical decisions. We tested the hypothesis that urinary endotrophin derived during COL VI deposition in fibrotic human kidneys is a marker for progression of CKD in the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care (RIISC) cohort, a prospective observational study of 499 CKD patients. Endotrophin localised to areas of increased COL VI deposition in fibrotic kidneys but was not present in histologically normal kidneys. The third and fourth quartiles of urinary endotrophin:creatinine ratio (ECR) were independently associated with one-year disease progression after adjustment for traditional risk factors (OR (95%CI) 3.68 (1.06-12.83) and 8.65 (2.46-30.49), respectively). Addition of ECR quartiles to the model for disease progression increased prediction as seen by an increase in category-free net reclassification improvement (0.45, 95% CI 0.16-0.74, p = 0.002) and integrated discrimination improvement (0.04, 95% CI 0.02-0.06, p < 0.001). ECR was associated with development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Bimagrumab is a human anti-ActRII antibody which was found to increase muscle mass and function by blocking ActRII signaling. As it has considerable potential for being misused as doping agent in sports, the aim of this study was to develop a mass spectrometric detection assay for doping control serum samples.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Within this study, a detection method for Bimagrumab in human serum was developed, which combines ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity purification with proteolytic digestion and LC-HRMS. To facilitate the unambiguous identification of the diagnostic peptides, an orthogonal IM separation was additionally performed.RESULTS: The assay was successfully validated and the analysis of clinical samples demonstrated its fitness for purpose for an application in routine doping control analysis.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although no myostatin inhibitors have obtained clinical approval yet, the proactive development of detection methods for emerging doping agents represents a key aspect of preventive doping research.

Fifty-five (82.1%) patients completed the study. Thigh muscle volume increased by Week 4 and remained increased at Week 24 in bimagrumab-treated patients, whereas no changes were observed with placebo (Week 4: +5.9% [SD, 3.4%] vs. 0.0% [3.3%], P < 0.001; Week 8: +7.0% [3.7%] vs. -0.7% [2.8%], P < 0.001; Week 16: +7.8% [5.1%] vs. -0.9% [4.5%], P < 0.001; Week 24: +5.0% [4.9%] vs. -1.3% [4.3%], P < 0.001).

This study aimed to explore the clinical potential of bimagrumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the activin type II receptor, for the recovery of skeletal muscle volume from disuse atrophy using an experimental model of lower extremity immobilization.METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy young men (n = 24; mean age, 24.1 years) were placed in a full-length cast of one of the lower extremities for 2 weeks to induce disuse atrophy. After cast removal, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of either bimagrumab 30 mg/kg (n = 15) or placebo (n = 9) and were followed for 12 weeks. Changes in thigh muscle volume (TMV) and inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) of the thigh, maximum voluntary knee extension strength, and safety were assessed throughout the 12 week study.RESULTS: Casting resulted in an average TMV loss of -4.8% and comparable increases in IMAT and SCAT volumes. Bimagrumab 30 mg/kg i.v. resulted in a rapid increase in TMV at 2 weeks following cast removal and a +5.1% increase above pre-cast levels at 12 weeks. In comparison, TMV returned to pre-cast level at 12 weeks (-0.1%) in the placebo group. The increased adiposity of the casted leg was sustained in the placebo group and decreased substantially in the bimagrumab group at Week 12 (IMAT: -6.6%, SCAT: -3.5%). Knee extension strength decreased by ~25% in the casted leg for all subjects and returned to pre-cast levels within 6 weeks after cast removal in both treatment arms. Bimagrumab was well tolerated with no serious or severe adverse events reported during the study.CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of bimagrumab 30 mg/kg i.v. safely accelerated the recovery of TMV and reversal of accumulated IMAT following 2 weeks in a joint-immobilizing cast.© 2017 Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research.

In normal intestinal epithelium, the COX-2 mRNA is targeted for rapid decay through the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) adenylate- and uridylate (AU)-rich element (ARE), whereas in tumors ARE-mediated decay is compromised. Here we show that the COX-2 ARE can mediate degradation through microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. We identified miR-16 to bind the COX-2 3'-UTR and inhibit COX-2 expression by promoting rapid mRNA decay. In colorectal cancer cells and tumors, miR-16 levels were decreased approximately twofold and miR-16 expression in cancer cells attenuated COX-2 expression and PG synthesis. The COX-2 ARE is also bound by the RNA-binding protein HuR. In colorectal cancer tumors, HuR is overexpressed and localized within the cytoplasm, where it promotes ARE-mRNA stabilization. Under conditions of HuR overexpression, miR-16 was unable to promote rapid mRNA decay through the COX-2 ARE. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation of HuR showed direct association with miR-16 that was reversed when cytoplasmic trafficking of HuR was inhibited. Furthermore, this interaction between HuR and miR-16 promoted the downregulation of miR-16. These new results identify miR-16 as a central posttranscriptional regulator of COX-2 and show the ability of elevated levels of HuR to antagonize miR-16 function.

After transfecting gastric cancer cells with miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p precursors, Alamar blue and apoptosis assays were used to measure the respective proliferation and apoptosis rates. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assays after miR-143 transfection. Reporter plasmids were constructed, and a luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the miR-143 binding site on COX-2.RESULTS: Both miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p were significantly downregulated in multiple gastric cancer cell lines. Forced miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p expression in gastric cancer cells produced a profound cytotoxic effect.

Then, the total RNAs were extracted and analyzed by microRNA (miRNA) microarray. Moreover, the target genes of miR-146b-3p were predicted by online miRNA target prediction algorithms. Meanwhile, luciferase reporter system was used for assaying the target gene for miRNA-146b-3p. Simultaneously, RT-PCR assay was used for the miRNA expression detection. Furthermore, western blot was applied to determine the expression of the signal pathway involved proteins. Our results demonstrated that expression of IL-6 and COX-2 were remarkably up-regulated in peripheral blood of DMCI patients compared with that in normal control group. In addition, miRNA microarray data suggested that miR-146b-3p expression was significantly down-regulated in DMCI patients, with v-raf-1 expression negatively regulated. Moreover, miR-146b-3p regulated RAF1 expression was found to mediate P38MAPK signaling activation in thrombosis patients. The following research indicated that activation of RAF1 trough miR-146b-3p down-regulation contributed to activation of RAF/P38MAPK/COX-2 signaling pathway in vascular infarction. Our data have implied that altered expression of miR-146b-3p is closely related to the progression and development of DCMI mediating the RAF/P38MAPK/COX-2 signal transduction pathway."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Our results suggest that modulating miR-101 and COX-2 levels or their activity may be a potential therapeutic strategy for endometrial cancer.", "answer_start": 1150}], "question": "Which micro-RNAs (miR) are associated with the human cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene promoter?", "id": "5d38673da1e1595105000002_020", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Abnormal angiogenesis is critically involved in tumor progression and metastasis including endometrial cancer and is regulated by microRNAs such as microRNA-101 (miR-101).

One mechanism of action is thought to be though the ability of biologics to induce homing and migration of endogenous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to a target tissue. However, the ability of biologics to stimulate chemotaxis (directed migration of cells) and chemokinesis (increase rate of cell migration) of MSCs is unknown.HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to directly compare the ability of biologics including platelet rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to induce MSC migration. The hypothesis was that leukocyte-low platelet rich plasma (Llo PRP) would induce migration to a greater extent than leukocyte-high platelet rich plasma (Lhi PRP) or BMC.METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated from 8 horses. Migration of MSCs toward a biologic (BMC, Llo PRP, and Lhi PRP) or the positive control platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) was continuously traced and measured for 24hrs using time-lapse microscopy and a microfluidics device. Cell migration, chemotaxis and chemokinesis were determined by measurements of displacement, number of cells migrated, and cell flux.RESULTS: All biologics resulted in a significantly greater percentage of MSCs migrated compared to the positive control (PDGF). MSCs migrated further toward BMC compared to Llo PRP. Cell migration, measured as cell flux, was greater toward BMC and Lhi PRP than Llo PRP.CONCLUSION: The biologics BMC and Lhi PRP elicit greater chemotaxis and chemokinesis of MSCs than Llo PRP. However, all biologics recruited the same number of MSCs suggesting that differences in other regenerative effects, such as growth factor concentration, between biologics should be strongly considered when choosing a biologic for treatment of musculoskeletal injuries.

Planned dose escalation was 80, 160, 240, 320, 400, and 480 mg. For pharmacokinetic analysis, timed blood samples were collected on day 1 and day 28. Next-generation sequencing was performed on circulating tumor DNA and genomic DNA from tumor samples. Results Thirty-eight patients were enrolled. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 diarrhea, which occurred in two patients administered 480 mg of pyrotinib; thus, the maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg. Common pyrotinib-related adverse events included diarrhea (44.7% [17 of 38]), nausea (13.2% [five of 38]), oral ulceration (13.2% [five of 38]), asthenia (10.5% [four of 38]), and leukopenia (10.5% [four of 38]). The only grade 3 adverse event was diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that pyrotinib exposure was dose dependent. The overall response rate was 50.0% (18 of 36), and the clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease ≥ 24 weeks) was 61.1% (22 of 36).

For this purpose, a robust analytical method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) was established to characterize the metabolites of pyrotinib in human plasma, feces, and urine, and identify the primary enzymes responsible for its metabolism. As a result, a total of 24 metabolites were identified, including 16 phase I metabolites resulting from dealkylation, oxidation, dehydrogenation, and carbonylation, and 8 phase II metabolites originating from cysteine and N-acetylcysteine conjugation. Pyrotinib was absorbed into blood by 1h, reached its peak level at 4h, and afterwards underwent slow elimination. The principal metabolites detected in humans (M1, M2, and M5) were products resulting from O-depicoline and pyrrolidine lactam formation, whose structures have been confirmed by the synthetic references. In addition, fecal clearance was the major route of excretion for pyrotinib. Further phenotyping experiment proved that CYP3A4 was the most active enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of pyrotinib, implying the vital necessity of the assessment of the potential CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interactions in humans.

Engagement of these receptors initiates endothelial signalling cascades that result in downstream effector mechanisms which in turn influence the progression of neuroinflammation.

Using a range of novel anti-ICAM-3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including one (MA4) that blocks apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages, alongside apoptotic human leukocytes that are normal or deficient for ICAM-3, we demonstrate that ICAM-3 promotes a domain 1-2-dependent tethering interaction with phagocytes.

The present study was designed to investigate, with immunochemical and immunohistochemical techniques, the effect of treatment with (+/-)-alpha lipoic (thioctic) acid and its enantiomers on heart and kidney endothelium in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Arterial hypertension is accompanied by an increased oxidative stress status in the heart characterized by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and nucleic acid oxidation increase. The higher oxidative stress also modifies adhesion molecules expression. In the heart VCAM-1, which was higher than ICAM-1 and PECAM-1, was increased in SHR. ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression was significantly greater in the renal endothelium of SHR. (+/-)-Alpha lipoic acid and (+)-alpha lipoic acid treatment significantly decreased TBARS levels, the nucleic acid oxidation and prevented adhesion molecules expression in cardiac and renal vascular endothelium.

Here we report the expression and the epigenetic regulation of GRP151 in the spinal cord after spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and the contribution of GPR151 to neuropathic pain in male mice. SNL dramatically increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. GPR151 mutation or spinal inhibition by shRNA alleviated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia. Interestingly, the CpG island in the GPR151 gene promoter region was demethylated, the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) was decreased, and the binding of DNMT3b with GPR151 promoter was reduced after SNL. Overexpression of DNMT3b in the spinal cord decreased GPR151 expression and attenuated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), a transcriptional factor of the KLF family, was upregulated in spinal neurons, and the binding affinity of KLF5 with GPR151 promoter was increased after SNL. Inhibition of KLF5 reduced GPR151 expression and attenuated SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity. Further mRNA microarray analysis revealed that mutation of GPR151 reduced the expression of a variety of pain-related genes in response to SNL, especially mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway-associated genes. This study reveals that GPR151, increased by DNA demethylation and the enhanced interaction with KLF5, contributes to the maintenance of neuropathic pain via increasing MAPK pathway-related gene expression.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are targets of various clinically approved drugs. Here we report that SNL increased GPR151 expression in the spinal cord, and mutation or inhibition of GPR151 alleviated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. In addition, SNL downregulated the expression of DNMT3b, which caused demethylation of GPR151 gene promoter, facilitated the binding of transcriptional factor KLF5 with the GPR151 promoter, and further increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. The increased GPR151 may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain via activating MAPK signaling and increasing pain-related gene expression.

We did a bedside-to-bench study in standardized rat stroke models to explore mechanisms for these untoward results.METHODS: After focal brain ischemia in Wistar rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we administered murine anti-rat ICAM-1 antibody (1A29), subclass-matched murine immunoglobulin (IgG1), or vehicle intravenously. To examine whether rat anti-mouse antibodies were generated against the mouse protein and whether these were deleterious, we sensitized Wistar rats with 1A29 or vehicle 7 days before surgery. Infarct volume, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, neutrophil CD11b expression, and microvascular E-selectin, P-selectin, and ICAM-1 expression were examined 48 hours after surgery. Complement activation was serially assessed for 2 hours after a single injection of either 1A29 or vehicle.RESULTS: 1A29 treatment did not significantly reduce infarct size in either strain. 1A29 sensitization augmented infarct size and generated rat anti-mouse antibodies. Although 1A29 inhibited neutrophil trafficking shown by reduction in brain myeloperoxidase activity, circulating neutrophils were activated and displayed CD11b upregulation. Complement was activated in 1A29-sensitized Wistar rats and 1A29-treated SHR. E-selectin (SHR), endothelial P-selectin (Wistar and SHR), and ICAM-1 (SHR) were upregulated in animals treated with 1A29.CONCLUSIONS: Administration to rats of a murine antibody preparation against ICAM-1, 1A29, elicits the production of host antibodies against the protein, activation of circulating neutrophils, complement activation, and sustained microvascular activation.

Belimumab is a target-specific, human IgG1λ monoclonal B-lymphocyte stimulator inhibitor currently in late stage investigation for the treatment of SLE. Unpublished Phase 3 trials have reported statistically significant results for primary endpoints when belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard of care was compared to placebo plus standard of care in seropositive patients with SLE.

There are four mammalian syndecans, SDC-1 thorough 4, which play a critical role in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis through independent and growth factor mediated signaling. An altered expression of SDCs is often observed in autoimmune disorders, cancer, HIV infection, and many other pathological conditions. SDCs modulate disease progression by interacting with a diverse array of ligands, receptors, and other proteins, including extracellular matrix, glycoproteins, integrins, morphogens, and various growth factors and chemokines, along with their receptors and kinases. Specifically, SDCs present on cell surface can bind directly to chemokines to enhance their binding to receptors, downstream signaling, and migration. Alternatively, SDCs can be cleaved and shed to mediate negative regulation of chemokine and growth factor signaling pathways and ligand sequestration. Importantly, SDC shedding may be a biomarker of inflammation, especially in chronic inflammatory diseases. While the current therapies for cancer and several autoimmune disorders have revolutionized treatment outcomes, understanding the pathophysiological role of SDCs and the use of HSPG mimetic or antagonists on cytokine signaling networks may uncover potentially novel targeted therapeutic approaches.

Loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) function leads to activation of the PI3K-AKT (phosphoinositide 3-kinase-RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase) pathway and is strongly associated with adverse oncological outcomes, making PTEN a potentially useful genomic marker to distinguish indolent from aggressive disease in patients with clinically localized tumours. At the other end of the disease spectrum, therapeutic compounds targeting nodes in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signalling pathway are being tested in clinical trials for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Knowledge of PTEN status might be helpful to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from these therapies. To enable the use of PTEN status as a prognostic and predictive biomarker, analytically validated assays have been developed for reliable and reproducible detection of PTEN loss in tumour tissue and in blood liquid biopsies. The use of clinical-grade assays in tumour tissue has shown a robust correlation between loss of PTEN and its protein as well as a strong association between PTEN loss and adverse pathological features and oncological outcomes. In advanced disease, assessing PTEN status in liquid biopsies shows promise in predicting response to targeted therapy. Finally, studies have shown that PTEN might have additional functions that are independent of the PI3K-AKT pathway, including those affecting tumour growth through modulation of the immune response and tumour microenvironment."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "BACKGROUND: Detection of a \"central vein sign\" (CVS) on FLAIR* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly specific and sensitive for multiple sclerosis (MS).

The Ets1 transcription factor acts in B cells to prevent PC differentiation. Ets1(-/-) mice accumulate PCs and produce autoantibodies. Ets1 expression is downregulated upon B cell activation through the BCR and TLRs and is maintained by the inhibitory signaling pathway mediated by Lyn, CD22 and SiglecG, and SHP-1. In the absence of these inhibitory components, Ets1 levels are reduced in B cells in a Btk-dependent manner. This leads to increased PCs, autoantibodies, and an autoimmune phenotype similar to that of Ets1(-/-) mice. Defects in inhibitory signaling molecules, including Lyn and Ets1, are associated with human lupus, although the effects are more subtle than the complete deficiency that occurs in knockout mice. In this study, we explore the effect of partial disruption of the Lyn/Ets1 pathway on B cell tolerance and find that Lyn(+/-)Ets1(+/-) mice demonstrate greater and earlier production of IgM, but not IgG, autoantibodies compared with Lyn(+/-) or Ets1(+/-) mice. We also show that Btk-dependent downregulation of Ets1 is important for normal PC homeostasis when inhibitory signaling is intact. Ets1 deficiency restores the decrease in steady state PCs and Ab levels observed in Btk(-/-) mice. Thus, depending on the balance of activating and inhibitory signals to Ets1, there is a continuum of effects on autoantibody production and PC maintenance.

It has shown to be effective in the photodynamic therapy of early or recurrent oral carcinomas, in the palliative treatment of refractory oral carcinomas and in the treatment of primary non-melanomatous tumours of the skin of the head and neck. Until now for all positive findings an intravenous application of the photosensitizer was mandatory. In the case of cutaneous malignant or non-malignant diseases a topical application of the drug onto the site of the disease followed by illumination, would be advantageous. Unfortunately, mTHPC is a highly hydrophobic drug with a low percutaneous absorption. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the photodynamic efficacy of novel mTHPC-loaded invasomes after their topical application onto the skin of mice bearing the subcutaneously implanted human colorectal tumour HT29 followed by photoirradiation. Invasomes are vesicles containing in addition to phospholipids a mixture of terpenes (cineole, citral and d-limonene) or only one terpene (citral) and ethanol, as penetration enhancers. This was a pilot study since until now no data are available about the efficacy of mTHPC in the photodynamic therapy of HT29 tumours after its topical application. The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether a mTHPC-loaded invasome formulation can reduce tumour size by photodynamic therapy or at least to find a formulation slowing down tumour growth compared to the control group (mice without any treatment). The groups of mice treated with mTHPC-invasomes containing 1% of the terpene mixture prior to photoirradiation showed a significantly smaller (p<0.05) tumour increase compared to control groups (mice without any treatment and mice only photoirradiated)."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "PTEN pseudogene (PTENp) acts as an endogenous RNA, which regulates its parental gene by competitively binding to the 3' UTR of PTEN gene in the human.

Among them, 32 were from rodents or primates. Phylogenetic analyse showed a complex evolutionary history of this gene family. Some PTENps were shared both in primates and rodents. However, some PTENps were shown to be species-specific, such as the tasmanian devil PTENp1, nine banded armadillo PTENp1 and gibbon PTENp1. Most interestingly, the naked mole rat (NMR), an anticancer model organism, possessed 17 copies of PTENps, which were classified into four clades based on the phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, we found that all the 3'UTR of PTEN and PTENps shared common microRNA (MicroRNA) binding sites in NMR, based on our prediction of specific MicroRNA binding sites. Our findings suggested that multiple gene duplications have occurred in the formation of PTEN/PTENp gene family during the evolution of mammals. Some PTENps were relatively ancient and were shared by primates and rodents; others were newly originated through species- specific gene duplications. PTENps in NMR may function as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate their counterpart genes by competing for common MicroRNAs, which may be one of the interpretations for the cancer resistance in NMR."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "PURPOSES: To inform about a case of Revesz syndrome (RS) with initial ophthalmological symptomatology of severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy of the left eye (LE).

Here we report a cancer mutational hotspot in MLL3 within the region encoding its plant homeodomain (PHD) repeats and demonstrate that this domain mediates association of MLL3 with the histone H2A deubiquitinase and tumor suppressor BAP1. Cancer-associated mutations in the sequence encoding the MLL3 PHD repeats disrupt the interaction between MLL3 and BAP1 and correlate with poor patient survival. Cancer cells that had PHD-associated MLL3 mutations or lacked BAP1 showed reduced recruitment of MLL3 and the H3K27 demethylase KDM6A (also known as UTX) to gene enhancers. As a result, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in tumor cells harboring BAP1 or MLL3 mutations restored normal gene expression patterns and impaired cell proliferation in vivo.

Answers. We analyzed the datasets using a widely adopted biomedical text processing framework Apache cTAKES and its extension YTEX. First, we applied the named entity recognition (NER) method implemented in YTEX to identify UMLS concepts in the datasets. We then analyzed the coverage and the popularity of concepts in the UMLS source vocabularies across the 2 datasets (ie, blogs and social Q&A). Further, we conducted a concept-level comparative coverage analysis between SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and Open-Access Collaborative Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV)-the top 2 UMLS source vocabularies that have the most coverage on our datasets. We also analyzed the UMLS semantic types that were frequently observed in our datasets.RESULTS: We identified 2415 UMLS concepts from blog postings, 6452 UMLS concepts from social Q&A questions, and 10,378 UMLS concepts from the answers. The medical concepts identified in the blogs can be covered by 56 source vocabularies in the UMLS, while those in questions and answers can be covered by 58 source vocabularies. SNOMED CT was the dominant vocabulary in terms of coverage across all the datasets, ranging from 84.9% to 95.9%. It was followed by OAC CHV (between 73.5% and 80.0%) and Metathesaurus Names (MTH) (between 55.7% and 73.5%). All of the social media datasets shared frequent semantic types such as \"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein,\" \"Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component,\" and \"Disease or Syndrome.\"CONCLUSIONS: Although the 3 social media datasets vary greatly in size, they exhibited similar conceptual coverage among UMLS source vocabularies and the identified concepts showed similar semantic type distributions. As such, concepts that are both frequently used by consumers and also found in professional vocabularies such as SNOMED CT can be suggested to OAC CHV to improve its coverage.©Min Sook Park, Zhe He, Zhiwei Chen, Sanghee Oh, Jiang Bian.

The Open Access and Collaborative Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV), which contains health-related terms used by lay consumers, has been created to bridge such a gap. Specifically, the OAC CHV facilitates consumers' health information retrieval by enabling consumer-facing health applications to translate between professional language and consumer friendly language. To keep up with the constantly evolving medical knowledge and language use, new terms need to be identified and added to the OAC CHV. User-generated content on social media, including social question and answer (social Q&A) sites, afford us an enormous opportunity in mining consumer health terms. Existing methods of identifying new consumer terms from text typically use ad-hoc lexical syntactic patterns and human review. Our study extends an existing method by extracting n-grams from a social Q&A textual corpus and representing them with a rich set of contextual and syntactic features. Using K-means clustering, our method, simiTerm, was able to identify terms that are both contextually and syntactically similar to the existing OAC CHV terms. We tested our method on social Q&A corpora on two disease domains: diabetes and cancer. Our method outperformed three baseline ranking methods.

SNAP-25 gene is associated with behavioral symptoms, personality and psychological disorders. In addition, SNAP-25 protein can be related to different neurotransmitter functions due to its association with vesicle membrane transition and fusion. This is important because neurologic, cognitive, and psychologic disorders in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) can be related to this function. This relationship may be enlightening for etiopathogenesis of FMS and treatment approaches. We aimed to study a SNAP-25 gene polymorphism, which is related to many psychiatric diseases, and FMS association in this prospective study.METHODS: We included 71 patients who were diagnosed according to new criteria and 57 matched healthy women in this study. Both groups were evaluated regarding age, height, weight, BMI, education level, marital and occupational status. A new diagnosis of FMS was made from criteria scoring, SF-36, Beck depression scale, and VAS that were applied to the patient group. SNAP-25 gene polymorphism and disease activity score correlations were compared.RESULTS: Mean age was 38±5,196 and 38.12±4.939 in patient and control groups, respectively (p=0.542).

How the reduced expression of SNAP-25 alters the properties of synaptic transmission, leading to a pathological phenotype, is unknown. We show that, unexpectedly, halved SNAP-25 levels at 13-14 DIV not only fail to impair synaptic transmission but instead enhance evoked glutamatergic neurotransmission. This effect is possibly dependent on presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel activity and is not accompanied by changes in spontaneous quantal events or in the pool of readily releasable synaptic vesicles. Notably, synapses of 13-14 DIV neurons with reduced SNAP-25 expression show paired-pulse depression as opposed to paired-pulse facilitation occurring in their wild-type counterparts. This phenotype disappears with synapse maturation.
