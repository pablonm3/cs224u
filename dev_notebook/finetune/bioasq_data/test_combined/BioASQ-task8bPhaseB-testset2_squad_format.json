Blood was collected at four time points after the second vaccination for plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) (primary endpoint) and ELISA (secondary endpoint) antibody assays. For each subject, the peak PRNT (or ELISA) titer was defined by the highest PRNT (or ELISA) titer among all available measurements post second vaccination. Non-inferiority of a non-standard arm compared to the standard arm was met if the upper limit of the 98.33% confidence interval of the difference in the mean log2 peak titers between the standard and non-standard arm was less than 1.RESULTS: Non-inferiority of the PRNT antibody response was not established for any of the three non-standard study arms. Non-inferiority of the ELISA antibody response was established for the Day 1 and 22 compressed schedule and for administration by JI. Solicited local reactions, such as redness and swelling, tended to be more commonly reported with JI administration. Four post-vaccination hypersensitivity reactions were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluations of the primary endpoint of PRNT antibody responses do not support alternative strategies of administering MVA vaccine by S&N on compressed schedules or administration by JI on the standard schedule.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01827371.Copyright © 2017.

SATB1 expression profiles were evaluated in well-differentiated NPC cell line CNE1, poorly-differentiated CNE2Z, undifferentiated C666-1 and immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelia NP-69 cells using quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting and fluorescent staining. After inhibition the SATB1 expression by using SATB1 specific small interfering RNA in these cell lines, the change of cell proliferation was investigated by western blotting analysis of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) expression and CCK-8 assay, and the cell migration was assessed by Transwell migration assay. Finally, the expressions of SATB1 and PCNA were examined in CNE1 cells that forced LMP-1 expression by fluorescent staining and RT-PCR.RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SATB1 protein expression was elevated in NPC tissues compared to benign nasopharyngeal tissues (P = 0.005). Moreover, high levels of SATB1 protein expression were positively correlated with clinical stage (P = 0.025), the status of lymph node metastasis (N classification) (P = 0.018), distant metastasis (M classification) (P = 0.041) and LMP-1 expression status (r = 2.35, P < 0.01) in NPC patients. In vitro experiments demonstrated that an inverse relationship between SATB1 expression and NPC differentiation status, with SATB1 weakly expressed in NP-69 cells and CNE1 cells, and significant increasingly expressed in CNE-2Z and C666-1 cells. Targeted knockdown of SATB1 expression obviously attenuated the proliferation and migration of highly SATB1-expressing CNE2Z and C666-1 cells, but not NP-69 and CNE1 cells. Interestingly, forced LMP-1 expression in CNE1 cells led to a surprisingly increasing SATB1 expression and nuclear location, companying with an up-regulated PCNA expression.CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that EBV LMP-1-mediated over-expression of SATB1 is associated with NPC progression, suggesting SATB1 may represent a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for NPC."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a cell type-specific matrix attachment region binding protein, functioning as a global genome organizer.

SATB1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and scored by two independent investigators. SATB1 expression was predominantly nuclear in both normal and cancer tissues. Loss of SATB1 nuclear expression was seen in 22% of colorectal cancers compared to 1.5% of adjacent normal colorectal tissue, and was associated with worse overall survival (P = 0.02) independent of age and stage of disease (HR 2.48 with 95% CI 1.31-4.70). Loss of SATB1 expression was more evident in younger patients (P = 0.03), tumours with mucinous or signet ring histology (P = 0.0001) and poor differentiation (P = 0.005). SATB1 expression was associated with a survival advantage in patients with Dukes C tumours who received adjuvant chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: Loss of SATB1 nuclear expression correlates with poor survival and a less favourable response to adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.

However, more detailed studies on the SATB1 functions in CRC are warranted. In this article, we comprehensively analyze the cellular and molecular role of SATB1 in CRC cell lines with different SATB1 expression levels by using RNAi-mediated knockdown. Using siRNAs with different knockdown efficacies, we demonstrate antiproliferative, cell cycle-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of SATB1 knockdown in a SATB1 gene dose-dependent manner. Tumor growth inhibition is confirmed in vivo in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model using stable knockdown cells. The in-depth analysis of cellular effects reveals increased activities of caspases-3, -7, -8, -9 and other mediators of apoptotic pathways. Similarly, the analysis of E- and N-cadherin, slug, twist, β-catenin and MMP7 indicates SATB1 effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and matrix breakdown. Our results also establish SATB1 effects on receptor tyrosine kinases and (proto-)oncogenes such as HER receptors and Pim-1.

CagY is an ortholog of VirB10 that, unlike other VirB10 orthologs, has a large middle repeat region (MRR) with extensive repetitive sequence motifs, which undergo CD4+ T cell-dependent recombination during infection of mice. Recombination in the CagY MRR reduces T4SS function, diminishes the host inflammatory response, and enables the bacteria to colonize at a higher density. Since CagY is known to bind human α5β1 integrin, we tested the hypothesis that recombination in the CagY MRR regulates T4SS function by modulating binding to α5β1 integrin. Using a cell-free microfluidic assay, we found that H. pylori binding to α5β1 integrin under shear flow is dependent on the CagY MRR, but independent of the presence of the T4SS pili, which are only formed when H. pylori is in contact with host cells. Similarly, expression of CagY in the absence of other T4SS genes was necessary and sufficient for whole bacterial cell binding to α5β1 integrin. Bacteria with variant cagY alleles that reduced T4SS function showed comparable reduction in binding to α5β1 integrin, although CagY was still expressed on the bacterial surface. We speculate that cagY-dependent modulation of H. pylori T4SS function is mediated by alterations in binding to α5β1 integrin, which in turn regulates the host inflammatory response so as to maximize persistent infection.IMPORTANCE Infection with H. pylori can cause peptic ulcers and is the most important risk factor for gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The major H. pylori virulence factor that determines whether infection causes disease or asymptomatic colonization is the type IV secretion system (T4SS), a sort of molecular syringe that injects bacterial products into gastric epithelial cells and alters host cell physiology. We previously showed that recombination in CagY, an essential T4SS component, modulates the function of the T4SS. Here we found that these recombination events produce parallel changes in specific binding to α5β1 integrin, a host cell receptor that is essential for T4SS-dependent translocation of bacterial effectors. We propose that CagY-dependent binding to α5β1 integrin acts like a molecular rheostat that alters T4SS function and modulates the host immune response to promote persistent infection."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Only two radioprotective compounds, amifostine and palifermin, currently have the US FDA approval for use in radiation therapy.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "List approved radioprotective compounds", "id": "5e5cbf4e1af46fc130000004_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Only two radioprotective compounds, amifostine and palifermin, currently have the US FDA approval for use in radiation therapy.

Specifically, we show that selinexor induces the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and when combined with dexamethasone increases GR transcriptional activity.

We investigated the effects of these medications on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) to determine their relative potential to reduce cardiovascular risk independent of their antihyperglycemic actions.METHODS: Ninety-two subjects with suboptimally controlled diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] >7.0%) were assigned to therapy with either rosiglitazone 4 mg once daily or metformin 850 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the change in hsCRP after 24 weeks. The change in CIMT was prespecified as a secondary end point.RESULTS: Metformin and rosiglitazone treatment led to similar significant improvements in glycemic control (HbA1c -1.08% in the rosiglitazone group and -1.18% in the metformin group, P = nonsignificant). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels decreased by an average of 68% in the rosiglitazone group (5.99 +/- 0.88 to 1.91 +/- 0.28 mg/L, P < .001), compared with a nonsignificant 4% reduction in hsCRP with metformin (5.69 +/- 0.83 to 5.46 +/- 0.92 mg/L; P = nonsignificant).

Thus, considering the known deleterious effects of angiotensin II mediated by angiotensin II type 1 receptor, the vascular benefits of metformin may be mediated, at least in part, by angiotensin II type 1 receptor downregulation.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and, subsequently, the effect of metformin in regressing angiotensin II (Ang-II)-mediated atheromatous plaque formation in ApoE(-/-) mice. AMPK activity was dose and time dependently downregulated during phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, which was accompanied by an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production. Of note, AMPK activators metformin and AICAR significantly attenuated PMA-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and proinflammatory cytokine production. However, inhibition of AMPK activity alone by compound C was ineffective in promoting monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation in the absence of PMA. On the other hand, inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity inhibited PMA-induced inflammation but not differentiation, suggesting that inflammation and differentiation are independent events. In contrast, inhibition of STAT3 activity inhibited both inflammation and monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. By decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation, metformin and AICAR through increased AMPK activation caused inhibition of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Metformin attenuated Ang-II-induced atheromatous plaque formation and aortic aneurysm in ApoE(-/-) mice partly by reducing monocyte infiltration. We conclude that the AMPK-STAT3 axis plays a pivotal role in regulating monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and that by decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation through increased AMPK activity, AMPK activators inhibit monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, was reported to possess anti-atherosclerotic effects.

After 2 weeks of acclimatization, the rabbits in the AS and Met groups were given a placebo and metformin, respectively, daily by gavage for 10 weeks. Plasma lipids and inflammatory cytokines were measured. The aorta was isolated for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with metformin, and monocyte adhesion and adhesion molecule expression were measured.KEY FINDINGS: Metformin reduced plasma inflammatory cytokine levels but did not alter lipid content. Compared with that in the AS group, the atherosclerosis burden in the Met group was significantly decreased. The lesional macrophage content was reduced, but the lesional collagen content was not affected in the metformin-treated rabbits, compared with the corresponding levels in the non-treated controls. Furthermore, the aortic mRNA expression levels of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines in the Met group were also significantly reduced compared with those in the AS group. Metformin treatment reduced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (ECs) and adhesion molecule expression, and inhibited rabbit monocyte differentiation into macrophages and the macrophage inflammatory response.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that metformin impeded the progression of atherosclerosis, possibly by suppressing macrophage infiltration and inflammatory responses.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

PPP2R4 knockdown reduced the proliferation and induced the apoptosis by activating caspases 3/7 in HEC265 and HEC1B cells.CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of the PP2A-B subunit, including PPP2R4, is an important indirect target of metformin.

The anti-tumor effect of metformin is widely known, however, there is only limited evidence regarding the anti-angiogenesis effect and chemosensitization of metformin and its underlying mechanisms in PDAC.MAIN METHODS: In the present study, we adopted a spontaneous PDAC mouse model named LSL‑KrasG12D/+; Trp53fl/+; Pdx1‑Cre (KPC) mice to explore the mechanism of the modulation of tumor angiogenesis and chemosensitization of metformin by treating KPC mice with metformin, gemcitabine or a combination of the two. H&E staining, Masson staining and immunohistochemical staining were adopted to describe the histopathology and biomarkers of the KPC in different groups.KEY FINDINGS: Metformin plus gemcitabine reduced tumorigenic potential of PDAC. Specifically, metformin showed an anti-pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) effect via decreasing the expression of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and then sparked some downstream effects, for example, inhibiting the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the tumor microenvironment, reducing the formation of tumor neovascularization, attenuating the desmoplastic reaction and enhancing the antitumor effect of gemcitabine.SIGNIFICANCE: We concluded that metformin suppressed tumor angiogenesis and enhanced the chemosensitivity of gemcitabine via inactivating PSCs in PDAC of KPC mice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Unraveling interactions between tumor cells and cells of the TME may identify novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets to prevent or treat metastasis. We report here the development and in vivo validation of a 3D tumor spheroid model to study the interactions between CRC cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in vitro. Co-cultured fibroblasts promoted SW620 and HCT116 CRC spheroid invasion, and this was prevented by the SRC and FGFR kinase inhibitors Dasatinib and Erdafitinib, respectively. To validate these findings in vivo, we injected SW620 cells alone or together with fibroblasts orthotopically in the caecum of mice. Co-injection with fibroblasts promoted lung metastasis growth, which was fully reversed by treatment with Dasatinib or Erdafitinib. Co-culture of SW620 or HCT116 CRC spheroids with endothelial cells suppressed spheroid growth while it had no effect on cancer cell migration or invasion. Consistent with this in vitro effect, co-injected endothelial cells significantly inhibited primary tumor growth in vivo. From these experiments we conclude that effects on cancer cell invasion and growth induced by co-cultured TME cells and drug treatment in the 3D spheroid model in vitro, are predictive of in vivo effects. The 3D spheroid model may be considered as an attractive model to study the effect of heterotypic cellular interactions and drug activities on cancer cells, as animal testing alternative.

In this study, we analyzed the functional significance of constitutive PR3 expression for neutrophil activation as induced by anti-PR3 antibody. Therefore, primed and nonprimed neutrophils were stimulated with the monoclonal anti-PR3 antibody PR3G-3. Activation was measured as actin polymerization by the phalloidin assay as an early, detectable activation event and oxidative burst by the dihydrorhodamine assay, as a late, detectable activation event.

We undertook this study to assess the differential expression of CD177 on neutrophils from patients with ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis (ASV) in comparison with patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and healthy individuals, and to investigate whether colocalization of mPR3 and CD177 affects anti-PR3-mediated neutrophil activation.METHODS: Expression of CD177 and mPR3 was analyzed by flow cytometry on isolated neutrophils from patients with ASV (n=53), those with SLE (n=30), those with RA (n=26), and healthy controls (n=31). Neutrophil activation mediated by anti-PR3 antibodies was assessed by measuring the oxidative burst with a dihydrorhodamine assay.RESULTS: Percentages of CD177-expressing neutrophils were significantly higher in patients with ASV and those with SLE than in healthy controls. In 3 healthy donors, CD177 expression was not detected. After priming with tumor necrosis factor alpha, neutrophils remained negative for CD177 while mPR3 expression was induced.

Although pimavanserin appears to have a pharmacologic mechanism that is different from other atypical antipsychotics, concern remained that the increased risk of death seen with antipsychotic use in elderly demented patients, and described in all approved antipsychotic labels, would also occur with pimavanserin. Pimavanserin bears the same boxed warning about the risk of death associated with antipsychotic use in elderly patients with dementia.© Copyright 2017 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "A fundamental question in developmental immunology is how bipotential thymocyte precursors generate both CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell lineages.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Are CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells and  CD4+ Helper T cells generated in the thyroid and express the T-cell receptor?", "id": "5e2e1017fbd6abf43b000020_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "A fundamental question in developmental immunology is how bipotential thymocyte precursors generate both CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell lineages.

Formation of chromatin generally limits accessibility of specific DNA sequences and inhibits progression of polymerases as they copy information from the DNA. The processes that select sites for initiating either transcription or replication are therefore strongly influenced by factors that modulate the properties of chromatin proteins. Further, in order to elongate their products, both DNA and RNA polymerases must be able to overcome the inhibition presented by chromatin (Lipford and Bell 2001; Workman and Kingston 1998). One way to adjust the properties of chromatin proteins is to covalently modify them by adding or removing chemical moieties. Both histone and non-histone chromatin proteins are altered by acetylation, methylation, and other changes, and the 'nucleosome modifying' complexes that perform these reactions are important components of pathways of transcriptional regulation (Cote 2002; Orphanides and Reinberg 2000; Roth et al. 2001; Strahl and Allis 2000; Workman and Kingston 1998). Another way to alter the effects of nucleosomes is to change the position of the histone octamers relative to specific DNA sequences (Orphanides and Reinberg 2000; Verrijzer 2002; Wang 2002; Workman and Kingston 1998). Since the ability of a sequence to be bound by specific proteins can vary significantly whether the sequence is in the linkers between nucleosomes or at various positions within a nucleosome, 'nucleosome remodeling' complexes that rearrange nucleosome positioning are also important regulators of transcription. Since the DNA replication machinery has to encounter many of the same challenges posed by chromatin, it seems likely that modifying and remodeling complexes also act during duplication of the genome, but most of the current information on these factors relates to regulation of transcription. This chapter describes the factor known variously as FACT in humans, where it promotes elongation of RNA polymerase II on nucleosomal templates in vitro (Orphanides et al. 1998, 1999), DUF in frogs, where it is needed for DNA replication in oocyte extracts (Okuhara et al. 1999), and CP or SPN in yeast, where it is linked in vivo to both transcription and replication (Brewster et al. 2001; Formosa et al. 2001). Like the nucleosome modifying and remodeling complexes, it is broadly conserved among eukaryotes, affects a wide range of processes that utilize chromatin, and directly alters the properties of nucleosomes. However, it does not have nucleosome modifying or standard ATP-dependent remodeling activity, and therefore represents a third class of chromatin modulating factors. It is also presently unique in the extensive connections it displays with both transcription and replication: FACT/DUF/CP/SPN appears to modify nucleosomes in a way that is directly important for the efficient functioning of both RNA polymerases and DNA polymerases. While less is known about the mechanisms it uses to promote its functions than for other factors that affect chromatin, it is clearly an essential part of the complex mixture of activities that modulate access to DNA within chromatin. Physical and genetic interactions suggest that FACT/DUF/CP/SPN affects multiple pathways within replication and transcription as a member of several distinct complexes. Some of the interactions are easy to assimilate into models for replication or transcription, such as direct binding to DNA polymerase alpha (Wittmeyer and Formosa 1997; Wittmeyer et al. 1999), association with nucleosome modifying complexes (John et al. 2000), and interaction with factors that participate in elongation of RNA Polymerase II (Gavin et al. 2002; Squazzo et al. 2002). Others are more surprising such as an association with the 19S complex that regulates the function of the 20S proteasome (Ferdous et al. 2001; Xu et al. 1995), and the indication that FACT/DUF/CP/SPN can act as a specificity factor for casein kinase II (Keller et al. 2001). This chapter reviews the varied approaches that have each revealed different aspects of the function of FACT/DUF/CP/SPN, and presents a picture of a factor that can both alter nucleosomes and orchestrate the assembly or activity of a broad range of complexes that act upon chromatin."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " We suggest a three-step model in which nucleosome remodelers, general transcription factors, and the transcriptional elongation machinery are primarily involved in generating the nucleosome positioning pattern in vivo.", "answer_start": 847}], "question": "How is transcriptional elongation affected by nucleosome positioning?", "id": "5d3883a0a1e1595105000017_008", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Although the genomic pattern of nucleosome positioning is broadly conserved, quantitative aspects vary over evolutionary timescales.

TFIIS acts in the chromatin context, but its contribution to the chromatin landscape has not yet been investigated. Co-transcriptional chromatin alterations include subtle changes in nucleosome positioning, like those expected to be elicited by TFIIS, which are elusive to detect. The most popular method to map nucleosomes involves intensive chromatin digestion by micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Maps based on these exhaustively digested samples miss any MNase-sensitive nucleosomes caused by transcription. In contrast, partial digestion approaches preserve such nucleosomes, but introduce noise due to MNase sequence preferences. A systematic way of correcting this bias for massively parallel sequencing experiments is still missing.RESULTS: To investigate the contribution of TFIIS to the chromatin landscape, we developed a refined nucleosome-mapping method in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on partial MNase digestion and a sequence-bias correction derived from naked DNA cleavage, the refined method efficiently mapped nucleosomes in promoter regions rich in MNase-sensitive structures. The naked DNA correction was also important for mapping gene body nucleosomes, particularly in those genes whose core promoters contain a canonical TATA element. With this improved method, we analyzed the global nucleosomal changes caused by lack of TFIIS. We detected a general increase in nucleosomal fuzziness and more restricted changes in nucleosome occupancy, which concentrated in some gene categories. The TATA-containing genes were preferentially associated with decreased occupancy in gene bodies, whereas the TATA-like genes did so with increased fuzziness. The detected chromatin alterations correlated with functional defects in nascent transcription, as revealed by genomic run-on experiments.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of partial MNase digestion and naked DNA correction of the sequence bias is a precise nucleosomal mapping method that does not exclude MNase-sensitive nucleosomes. This method is useful for detecting subtle alterations in nucleosome positioning produced by lack of TFIIS. Their analysis revealed that TFIIS generally contributed to nucleosome positioning in both gene promoters and bodies. The independent effect of lack of TFIIS on nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness supports the existence of alternative chromatin dynamics during transcription elongation."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with hereditary predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer.

Acute skin reactions are one of the most common side effects of radiation therapy, and prevention of this adverse event has been investigated in several studies. However, a clinically applicable, preventative treatment remains unavailable. It has been demonstrated that application of a low-power laser can promote tissue repair. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an indium gallium aluminum phosphorus (InGaAIP) laser operated at 660 nm in preventing radiodermatitis in women undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial. A total of 52 patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer (stages I to III) will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group to receive laser therapy (n = 26) or a control group to receive a placebo (n = 26). The laser or placebo will be applied five days a week, immediately before each radiotherapy session. Skin reactions will then be graded weekly by a nurse, a radiotherapist, and an oncologist (all of whom will be blinded) using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) developed by the National Cancer Institute and the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria developed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Patients will also answer a modified visual analogue scale for pain (a self-evaluation questionnaire). Primary and secondary outcomes will be the prevention of radiodermatitis and pain secondary to radiodermatitis, respectively.DISCUSSION: The ideal tool for preventing radiodermatitis is an agent that mediates DNA repair or promotes cell proliferation. Application of a low-power laser has been shown to promote tissue repair by reducing inflammation and inducing collagen synthesis. Moreover, this treatment approach has not been associated with adverse events and is cost-effective. Thus, the results of this ongoing trial may establish whether use of a low-power laser represents an ideal treatment option for the prevention of radiodermatitis.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02003599.

While less selective JAK inhibitors have shown long-term efficacy in treating inflammatory conditions, this was accompanied by dose-limiting side effects. Here, we describe the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib and its active metabolite in healthy volunteers and the use of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation to support dose selection for phase IIB in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.METHODS: Two trials were conducted in healthy male volunteers. In the first trial, filgotinib was administered as single doses from 10 mg up to multiple daily doses of 200 mg. In the second trial, daily doses of 300 and 450 mg for 10 days were evaluated. Non-compartmental analysis was used to determine individual pharmacokinetic parameters for filgotinib and its metabolite. The overall pharmacodynamic activity for the two moieties was assessed in whole blood using interleukin-6-induced phosphorylation of signal-transducer and activator of transcription 1 as a biomarker for JAK1 activity. These data were used to conduct non-linear mixed-effects modeling to investigate a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship.RESULTS: Modeling and simulation on the basis of early clinical data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib are dose proportional up to 200 mg, in agreement with observed data, and support that both filgotinib and its metabolite contribute to its pharmacodynamic effects. Simulation of biomarker response supports that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect is reached at a daily dose of 200 mg filgotinib.CONCLUSION: Based on these results, a daily dose range up to 200 mg has been selected for phase IIB dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01179581 NCT01384422 NCT01419990."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor filgotinib (GLPG0634), which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease, demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy profiles in RA patients after 4 weeks of daily dosing.

We undertook this study to test our hypothesis that selective inhibition of JAK-1 would combine good efficacy with a better safety profile compared with less selective JAK inhibitors.METHODS: In two 4-week exploratory, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa trials, 127 RA patients with an insufficient response to methotrexate (MTX) received filgotinib (GLPG0634, GS-6034) oral capsules (100 mg twice daily or 30, 75, 150, 200, or 300 mg once daily) or placebo, added onto a stable regimen of MTX, to evaluate safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of filgotinib. The primary efficacy end point was the number and percentage of patients in each treatment group meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) at week 4.RESULTS: Treatment with filgotinib at 75-300 mg met the primary end point and showed early onset of efficacy. ACR20 response rates progressively increased to week 4, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein (CRP) level decreased. Marked and sustained improvements were observed in serum CRP level and other PD markers. The PK of filgotinib and its major metabolite was dose proportional over the 30-300 mg range. Early side effects seen with other less selective JAK inhibitors were not observed (e.g., there was no worsening of anemia [JAK-2 inhibition related], no effects on liver transaminases, and no increase in low-density lipoprotein or total cholesterol). A limited decrease in neutrophils without neutropenia was consistent with immunomodulatory effects through JAK-1 inhibition. There were no infections. Overall, filgotinib was well tolerated. Events related to study drug were mild or moderate and transient during therapy, and the most common such event was nausea.CONCLUSION: Selective inhibition of JAK-1 with filgotinib shows initial efficacy in RA with an encouraging safety profile in these exploratory studies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01384422 NCT01668641.© 2017 The Authors.

Patients (aged ≥18 years) had active moderate-to-severe psoriatic arthritis (defined as at least five swollen joints and at least five tender joints) fulfilling Classification for psoriatic arthritis (CASPAR) criteria, active or a documented history of plaque psoriasis, and an insufficient response or intolerance to at least one conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD). Patients continued to take csDMARDs during the study if they had received this treatment for at least 12 weeks before screening and were on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before baseline. Using an interactive web-based system, we randomly allocated patients (1:1) to filgotinib 200 mg or placebo orally once daily for 16 weeks (stratified by current use of csDMARDs and previous use of anti-tumour necrosis factor). Patients, study team, and sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients achieving 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20) at week 16 in the full analysis set (patients who received at least one dose of study drug), which was compared between groups with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and non-responder imputation method. This trial is registered with ClincalTrials.gov, number NCT03101670.FINDINGS: Between March 9, and Sept 27, 2017, 191 patients were screened and 131 were randomly allocated to treatment (65 to filgotinib and 66 to placebo). 60 (92%) patients in the filgotinib group and 64 (97%) patients in the placebo group completed the study; five patients (8%) in the filgotinib group and two patients (3%) in the placebo group discontinued treatment. 52 (80%) of 65 patients in the filgotinib group and 22 (33%) of 66 in the placebo group achieved ACR20 at week 16 (treatment difference 47% [95% CI 30·2-59·6], p<0·0001). 37 (57%) patients who received filgotinib and 39 (59%) patients who received placebo had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Six participants had an event that was grade 3 or worse. The most common events were nasopharyngitis and headache, occurring at similar proportions in each group. One serious treatment-emergent adverse event was reported in each group (pneumonia and hip fracture after a fall), one of which (pneumonia) was fatal in the filgotinib group.INTERPRETATION: Filgotinib is efficacious for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis, and no new safety signals were identified.FUNDING: Galapagos and Gilead Sciences.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of age and renal impairment (RI) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of filgotinib and its main metabolite.METHODS: The effect of age was assessed in two groups of 10 elderly healthy subjects (65-74 and ≥75 years of age) and a control group of 10 younger healthy subjects (40-50 years of age). The impact of RI was investigated in three groups of subjects with mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 6) and severe (n = 3) RI [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60-89, 30-59 and 15-29 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 , respectively] and a control group (n = 9) with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ). The PK of filgotinib and its metabolite were evaluated following filgotinib 100 mg once-daily doses for 10 days.RESULTS: At steady state, the exposure [area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC0-24 h )] of filgotinib and its metabolite was moderately higher (1.45- and 1.33-fold, respectively) in the elderly subjects (≥75 years) compared with younger subjects. Renal clearance for filgotinib and its metabolite decreased with the degree of RI, leading to a maximum increase in AUC0-24 h of 1.54-fold for filgotinib and 2.74-fold for the metabolite in subjects with severe RI. Filgotinib was generally safe and well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: Age and mild to moderate impairment of renal function had limited impact on the PK of filgotinib. In subjects with severe RI, the exposure to the metabolite of filgotinib was elevated, consistent with its renal elimination pathway.© 2018 Galapagos SASU.

This type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of ETV for treatment of patients with iNPH compared to conservative therapy, or shunting of CSF using VP or VA shunts.To assess the perioperative and postoperative complication rates in patients with iNPH after ETV compared to conservative therapy, VP or VA shunting.SEARCH METHODS: We searched for eligible studies using ALOIS: a comprehensive register of dementia studies, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and several bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME).We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) to identify potentially relevant reviews. The search strategy was adapted for other databases, using the most appropriate controlled vocabulary for each. We did not apply any language or time restrictions. The searches were performed in August 2014.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ETV treatment of iNPH. Patients had to have at least two symptoms of the Hakim-Adams triad. Exclusion criteria were obstructive causes of hydrocephalus, other significant intracranial pathology and other confirmed causes of dementia. The eligible comparators were conservative treatment or shunting using VP and VA shunts.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened search results, selected eligible studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for additional data.MAIN RESULTS: Only one study met the inclusion criteria: an RCT comparing effectiveness of ETV and non-programmable VP shunts in 42 patients with iNPH. The study was conducted in Brazil between 2009 and 2012. The overall study risk of bias was high. The primary outcome in the study was the proportion of patients with improved symptoms one year after surgery, determined as a change of at least two points on the Japanese NPH scale. Due to imprecision in the results, it was not possible to determine whether there was any difference between groups in the proportion of patients who improved 3 or 12 months after surgery (3 months: odds ration (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.76, n = 42; 12 months: OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.62 to 10.11, n = 38). We were unable to estimate the effect of treatment on other efficacy outcomes (cognition, balance, function, gait and mobility) because they were inadequately reported. Of the 26 patients in the VP shunting group, 5 developed subdural hematoma postoperatively, while there were no complications among the 16 patients in the ETV group (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.3, n = 42), but the estimate was too imprecise to determine whether this was likely to reflect a true difference in complication rates. This was also the case for rates of further surgical intervention (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.31 to 6.24, n = 42). There were no deaths during the trial. We judged the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be very low because of a high risk of selection, attrition and reporting bias and serious imprecision in the results.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The only randomised trial of ETV for iNPH compares it to an intervention which is not a standard practice (VP shunting using a non-programmable valve). The evidence from this study is inconclusive and of very low quality. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the evidence. There is a need for more robust research on this topic to be able to determine the effectiveness of ETV in patients with iNPH."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The definition of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), in adults, associates clinical signs (Adams and Hakim triad) involving gait disorders, urinary incontinence and dementia, associated with aspects on brain imaging that are consistent with this hypothesis and also normal or slightly increased intracranial pressure.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?", "id": "5e2f9e0dfbd6abf43b000034_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The definition of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), in adults, associates clinical signs (Adams and Hakim triad) involving gait disorders, urinary incontinence and dementia, associated with aspects on brain imaging that are consistent with this hypothesis and also normal or slightly increased intracranial pressure. The aim of this study was to clarify the techniques and methods facilitating the diagnosis of NPH. The literature review has been conducted from the Medline database without date limitation including the keywords \"normal pressure hydrocephalus\" and \"diagnosis.\" They should appear in the article title. From the 43 initially sorted, only 13 have been selected using exclusion criteria. The proposed methods are very sparse and focused on the improvement after surgical shunt. This focus is independent from the diagnosis criteria proposed in 2005. This introduces an ambiguity in the interpretation of the results. In practice, the diagnosis of NPH is more difficult in the elderly population where differential diagnoses are frequent, particularly vascular lesions (notably microangiopathy) and Alzheimer's disease. The more invasive techniques as continuous spinal drainage (usually during 3 days) or some features of CSF dynamics (Rout, compliance) seem to be the best predictors of after shunt improvement. However, these techniques are difficult to use in routine in the elderly. The combination of Evans index and corpus callosum angle on MRI is very useful to improve the differential diagnosis with cerebral atrophy. Spinal tap test (lumbar puncture with the removal of 40 mL of CSF) can be repeated two or three times for consecutive days to improve the predictive value before shunting. Gait and balance often improve after shunt, more than cognition and bladder disorders. In the elderly population, the prognosis after 3 years is non conclusive despite initial improvement. Poor prognosis seems to be due to associated pathologies in particular neurodegenerative diseases. This should be considered in decision-making of CSF shunt."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a clinical triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence combined with radiographic findings of ventriculomegaly and laboratory findings of normal cerebrospinal fluid pressures.

However, only a small subset of potentially druggable targets has attracted significant research and development resources. The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project develops resources to catalyze the development of likely targetable, yet currently understudied prospective drug targets. A central component of the IDG program is a comprehensive knowledge resource of the druggable genome.RESULTS: As part of that effort, we have developed a framework to integrate, navigate, and analyze drug discovery data based on formalized and standardized classifications and annotations of druggable protein targets, the Drug Target Ontology (DTO). DTO was constructed by extensive curation and consolidation of various resources. DTO classifies the four major drug target protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors, based on phylogenecity, function, target development level, disease association, tissue expression, chemical ligand and substrate characteristics, and target-family specific characteristics. The formal ontology was built using a new software tool to auto-generate most axioms from a database while supporting manual knowledge acquisition. A modular, hierarchical implementation facilitate ontology development and maintenance and makes use of various external ontologies, thus integrating the DTO into the ecosystem of biomedical ontologies. As a formal OWL-DL ontology, DTO contains asserted and inferred axioms. Modeling data from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target disease relationships.CONCLUSIONS: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene, protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models, drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug discovery.

Nevertheless, the molecular features remain largely unknown.Objective: To investigate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in a large series of peritoneal mesothelioma and characterize the mutational landscape of these tumors.Design, Setting, and Participants: We studied 88 consecutive patients (39 men, 49 women; median age 61, range 17-84 years) with peritoneal mesotheliomas diagnosed at a single institution between 2005 and 2015. We identified ALK-positive mesotheliomas by immunohistochemistry and confirmed ALK rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In ALK-rearranged cases, we characterized the fusion partners using targeted next-generation sequencing of both tumor DNA and RNA. In select cases, we quantified asbestos fibers by combined scanning electron microscopy and x-ray spectroscopy. We also explored ALK rearrangement in a separate series of 205 patients with pleural mesothelioma.Main Outcomes and Measures: Identification and characterization of novel ALK rearrangements and correlations with clinicopathologic characteristics.Results: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase was positive by immunohistochemistry in 11 (13%) peritoneal mesotheliomas (focal weak in 8, diffuse strong in 3). In focal weak ALK-positive cases, no ALK rearrangement was detected by FISH or next-generation sequencing. In strong diffuse ALK-positive cases, FISH confirmed ALK rearrangements, and next-generation sequencing identified novel fusion partners ATG16L1, STRN, and TPM1. Patients with ALK-rearranged peritoneal mesotheliomas were women and younger than patients without ALK rearrangement (median age 36 vs 62; Mann-Whitney test, P = .02), but all other clinicopathologic characteristics (size of tumor nodules, histology, treatment, and survival) were not different.

In this study, chrysotile from Mangnai, Qinghai, China, and an artificial substitute, rock wool fiber were prepared as suspensions and were tested at concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml in V79 lung fibroblasts. Chromosome aberrations were detected by micronucleus assay after exposure for 24 h, and DNA damage were estimated by single cell gel electrophoresis after exposure for 12, 24, or 48 h. According to the results, chrysotile and rock wool fibers caused micronuclei to form in a dose-dependent manner in V79 cells; olive tail moment values increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When V79 cells were exposed to a concentration of 200 μg/ml, the degree of DNA damage induced by chrysotile fibers was greater than rock wool fibers. Our study suggests that both chrysotile and rock wool fibers could induce chromosome aberrations and DNA damage.

My topics are etiology, herniosis, diverticulosis coli, and cancer. Hippocrates blamed wear and tear for herniation. Russell's (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) explanation was congenital peritoneal \"buds\" extending down to the pelvis. Harrison (Arch Surg 4:680-689, 1922) attributed herniae to transversalis fascial degradation. Keith (Lancet 2(17):1398-1399, 1906) concluded that pathology was involved, even though Russell (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) had denied it. Nevertheless, the congenital theory prevailed. According to McVay (Christopher's textbook of surgery, W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1960, p. 159), defects arise in normal musculo-aponeurotic structures. Research showed that atrophy was caused by damaged fibroblasts producing less collagen, which was abnormal (having a reduced I/III ratio). The disease was systemic, later named herniosis. Nicotine addiction increased the incidence of herniation by an inflammatory process named metastatic emphysema. In 1948, Saint's Triad, an aggregation of hiatus hernia (later, any primary hernia), gallstones, and diverticulosis coli, was introduced. This association occurred eight times more often than expected, with herniosis appearing to be its cause, abetted by high blood cholesterol causing gallstones. In 2006, Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) provided evidence that colon cancer is accompanied by a reduction in diverticula. Klinge et al. (Hernia 8(4):300-301, 2004) showed that these entities require different extracellular matrices (ECMs). Ghajar and Bissell (Histochem Cell Biol 130:1105-1118, 2008) pointed out that the ECM, which comprises 80% of the breast, influences its epithelial genetic expression, likewise with other organs (kidney, skin, lung, colon, and ovaries). Recently, a fundamental change in our understanding of cancer growth and metastasis has taken place. Whereas the degradation of connective tissue was thought to encourage invasion, eliciting concern for the herniated, now, investigators report the reverse, a reactive vascularized stroma resembling wound healing with an increase in fibroblasts and collagen I. Words such as desmoplasia, fibrosis, and stiffening abound. In conclusion, degradation of the ECM may be why herniosis appears to be hostile to the development of cancer throughout the body. Studies are needed of patients with and without a history of hernia to determine their incidence of cancer. Data from smokers should be separated, since they carry their own high risk of malignancy."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Remarkably, clinical studies of Saint's triad extending over the past 60 years have repeatedly demonstrated a highly significant relationship between colonic diverticula and abdominal herniae.

Wound healing may be affected, leading to recurrences after hernia repair or primary incisional herniation. Women with genitourinary prolapse show signs of herniosis in the pelvis. Diverticulosis coli, commonly seen in the elderly, like hernia, was once attributed to stress and strain from constipation. It is now suspected that herniosis weakens the colonic ECM, allowing the mucosa to form diverticula by herniating alongside the vasa recta. Remarkably, clinical studies of Saint's triad extending over the past 60 years have repeatedly demonstrated a highly significant relationship between colonic diverticula and abdominal herniae. Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) reported that diverticula and cancer are rarely coincident in the colon, despite aging. Their data indicate that the two pathologies arise in different ECMs. Klinge et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 22:515-520, 2007), quoting Paget (Lancet 1:571-573, 1889), \"Tumor cells can like seeds only grow if they fall on congenial soil,\" suggested that certain genes prevent stromal malignancy by influencing the microenvironment to stop epithelia from becoming cancerous. Thus, damage to the colonic ECM from hernial disease is conducive to diverticulosis, but hostile for cancer. Hernial disease being systemic, a similar ECM should be present throughout the body. Coincident diverticulosis and herniae support this hypothesis. Its validation requires further research involving the lifetime risk of cancer in patients with and without hernia.

Chi-square tests and calculated odds ratios (ORs) were utilized to describe the magnitude of association, and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the variables associated with Saint's triad.RESULTS: Among 637,518 patient records (1996-2005), any hernia was diagnosed among 22,181 (3.5%) patients, hiatus hernia among 1,661 (0.3%), diverticulosis of the colon among 14,375 (2.3%), and gallbladder disease among 5,284 (0.8%). The following associations were observed: diverticulosis, hiatus hernia (OR: 6.9), hiatus hernia, gallbladder disease (OR = 3.8), and gallbladder disease, diverticulosis (OR = 5.9). Patients with both diverticulosis and gallbladder disease were more likely to have hiatus hernia (OR = 3.8; P = 0.0012) or any hernia (OR = 10.7; P < 0.0001). Diseases associated with Saint's triad (incorporating any hernia) included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 4.3), hypertension (OR = 3.1), aortic aneurysm (OR = 2.2), and diabetes (OR = 1.8).CONCLUSIONS: Herniosis, the systemic connective tissue disease known to cause diverticulosis and herniae, may be responsible for Saint's triad.

However, no defects in the mitotic function of cohesin have been observed so far and the links between NIPBL mutations and the observed developmental defects are unclear. We show that NIPBL binds to chromatin in somatic cells with a different timing than cohesin.

NIPBL or cohesin knockdown reduce transcription of these genes differently, suggesting a cohesin-independent role of NIPBL for transcription. Motif analysis and comparison to published data show that NIPBL co-localizes with a specific set of other transcription factors. In cells derived from CdLS patients NIPBL binding levels are reduced and several of the NIPBL-bound genes have previously been observed to be mis-expressed in CdLS.

Here we use zebrafish and mouse models of CdLS to examine how transcriptional changes caused by Nipbl deficiency give rise to limb defects, a common condition in individuals with CdLS. In the zebrafish pectoral fin (forelimb), knockdown of Nipbl expression led to size reductions and patterning defects that were preceded by dysregulated expression of key early limb development genes, including fgfs, shha, hand2 and multiple hox genes. In limb buds of Nipbl-haploinsufficient mice, transcriptome analysis revealed many similar gene expression changes, as well as altered expression of additional classes of genes that play roles in limb development. In both species, the pattern of dysregulation of hox-gene expression depended on genomic location within the Hox clusters. In view of studies suggesting that Nipbl colocalizes with the mediator complex, which facilitates enhancer-promoter communication, we also examined zebrafish deficient for the Med12 Mediator subunit, and found they resembled Nipbl-deficient fish in both morphology and gene expression. Moreover, combined partial reduction of both Nipbl and Med12 had a strongly synergistic effect, consistent with both molecules acting in a common pathway. In addition, three-dimensional fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that Nipbl and Med12 are required to bring regions containing long-range enhancers into close proximity with the zebrafish hoxda cluster.

NIPBL loads cohesin onto chromatin. Cohesin mediates sister chromatid cohesion important for mitosis but is also increasingly recognized as a regulator of gene expression. In CdLS patient cells and animal models, expression changes of multiple genes with little or no sister chromatid cohesion defect suggests that disruption of gene regulation underlies this disorder. However, the effect of NIPBL haploinsufficiency on cohesin binding, and how this relates to the clinical presentation of CdLS, has not been fully investigated. Nipbl haploinsufficiency causes CdLS-like phenotype in mice. We examined genome-wide cohesin binding and its relationship to gene expression using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Nipbl+/- mice that recapitulate the CdLS phenotype.RESULTS: We found a global decrease in cohesin binding, including at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites and repeat regions. Cohesin-bound genes were found to be enriched for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at their promoters; were disproportionately downregulated in Nipbl mutant MEFs; and displayed evidence of reduced promoter-enhancer interaction. The results suggest that gene activation is the primary cohesin function sensitive to Nipbl reduction. Over 50% of significantly dysregulated transcripts in mutant MEFs come from cohesin target genes, including genes involved in adipogenesis that have been implicated in contributing to the CdLS phenotype.CONCLUSIONS: Decreased cohesin binding at the gene regions is directly linked to disease-specific expression changes.

UVR from sun exposure and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known to be a pivotal factor in the aetiology of skin cancer. The pineal hormone melatonin is recognized as the most potent endogenous antioxidant. Melatonin conducts its antioxidant effects acting directly as a radical scavenger and indirectly by up regulation of antioxidant enzymes. It has been proposed, that melatonin may have a protective effect against UVR-induced skin damage. The aim of this thesis was to: - Clarify melatonin's protective effect against UVR-induced skin damage in laboratory and clinical settings trough a systematic review of the literature. - To clinically assess the protective effect of topical treatment with melatonin against natural sun exposure, and determine the optimal concentration. - To clinically evaluate the degree of cognitive dysfunction with full body application of topical melatonin. Study 1: This was a systematic review using the databases Pubmed, EM-BASE and Cinahl. The databases were searched up to January 2013 to identify studies evaluating melatonin's protective effect against UVR-induced erythema in humans, and damage on a cellular level. Twenty studies were included, four human and 16 experimental. The results indicated that melatonin had a protective effect against UVR-induced erythema if applied before exposure, and this effect was probably obtained by melatonin acting directly as an antioxidant, and indirectly by regulating gene expression and inducing a DNA stabilizing effect. As these results were obtained using artificial UVR-sources and without investigating possible side effects, studies using natural sunlight and evaluating possible side effects of topical melatonin administration were warranted. Study 2: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We evaluated the protective effect of three different doses of topical melatonin against erythema induced by natural sun-light. The primary outcome was reduction in erythema, evaluated by chromatography, after sun exposure, when treated with topi-cal melatonin (0.5%, 2.5%, 12.5%) versus placebo and no treatment. A significant difference in erythema formation was found between areas treated with melatonin 12.5% and areas receiving placebo or no treatment. However, this was only seen in participants with an erythema reaction to the sun exposure. Further-more, the treated skin areas were very small and studies assessing any potential adverse effects were necessary. Study 3: This also was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. We assessed the degree of cognitive dysfunction with full body application of topical melatonin 12.5%. Cognition was evaluated using a neuropsychological test battery consisting of Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS), finger tapping test (FTT) and continuous reaction time (CRT). The impact on KSS was the primary outcome. We found no significant effect on cognition, however, large inter-individual variation was observed. These results support that melatonin is a safe drug for dermal application. The studies in this thesis may be valuable in the research field of melatonin's protective potential against UVR-induced oxidative skin damage. Increasing incidence of skin cancer is reported worldwide, and experts have suggested that the problem will only increase further, due to depletion of the ozone layer and the aging population. Furthermore, high-risk patient groups are emerging with the widely use of immunosuppressive medicine in various diseases, and this high-risk is in spite of use of protective measures known today. Therefore, development of new and more effective sun protective agents, with other qualities than simple chemical reflection of the UVR, is more important than ever. We have supported the suggestion of melatonin as a sun protective agent, and added the clinical relevant feature, that melatonin also has a protective effect against natural sunlight. Furthermore, we have supported the idea of melatonin being a safe drug for topical treatment, even in previous unknown high dosages. However, before any clinical implementation of melatonin as a sun protective agent can take place, further studies evaluating the long-term effects are warranted."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) derived from solar light causes skin damage by causing DNA lesions and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in keratinocytes and other epidermal cells.", "answer_start": 12}], "question": "What is known about ROS production in relation to UVR?", "id": "5e481b2cd14c9f295d00000a_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) derived from solar light causes skin damage by causing DNA lesions and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in keratinocytes and other epidermal cells. The type 2 transmembrane serine protease matriptase has characteristics that allow keratinocytes to respond to/recover from, environmental insults to the skin. This response may depend on its roles in epidermal proliferation and early differentiation, and its rapid activation in response to changes in the cellular chemical milieu, including increased oxidative stress.OBJECTIVE: We investigate the regulation of matriptase activation and its role in the response of the skin to exposure to different parts of the UV spectrum including UVA UVB, and UVR.METHODS: The activation state and distribution of matriptase in ex vivo UV exposed human skin specimens and sun damaged skin samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. HaCaT immortalized human keratinocytes were also used to investigate the mechanism of matriptase zymogen activation induced by UV irradiation. Levels of cytosolic ROS were determined by H2DCF assay. Activated matriptase, PARP and caspase 3 cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting, and the apoptotic ratio was measured by Hoechst 33258 staining.RESULTS: UVB exposure rapidly increased matriptase zymogen activation in the basal keratinocytes of skin samples. Activated matriptase was also detected at much higher levels in both the basal and spinous layer keratinocytes in sun damaged skin with actinic elastosis. UVB and solar light-induced matriptase zymogen activation likely results from UV-induced ROS generation, given that UVR, UVA, and UVB irradiation induced HaCaT human keratinocytes to activate matriptase in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and that this was suppressed by the ROS scavenger N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone and reducing agent dithiothreitol. Matriptase deficient HaCaT keratinocytes were more susceptible to UV-induced apoptosis than control cells, suggesting a protective role for matriptase in UV exposed keratinocytes.CONCLUSION: UV irradiation/ROS induced matriptase proteolysis may have short term protective effects and contribute to the recovery from acute epidermal damage and/or pathology of skin with chronic sun damage.Copyright © 2016 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited NDD caused by autosomal-dominant expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat mutation in the gene coding for Huntingtin (Htt). Previous studies have suggested the coexistence of phosphorylated-Tau, α-synuclein (α-Syn) and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions in HD. However, definite evidence that HD pathology in humans can be accompanied by other proteinopathies is still lacking. Using human post-mortem putamen samples from 31 controls and 56 HD individuals, we performed biochemical analyses of the expression, oligomerization and aggregation of Tau, α-Syn, TDP-43, and Amyloid precursor protein (APP)/Aβ. In HD brain, we observed reduced soluble protein (but not mRNA) levels of Htt, α-Syn, and Tau. Our results also support abnormal phosphorylation of Tau in more advanced stages of disease. Aberrant splicing of Tau exons 2, 3 (exclusion) and 10 (inclusion) was also detected in HD patients, leading to higher 0N4R and lower 1N3R isoforms. Finally, following formic acid extraction, we observed increased aggregation of TDP-43, α-Syn, and phosphorylated-Tau during HD progression. Notably, we observed that 88% of HD patients with Vonsattel grade 4 neuropathology displayed at least one non-Htt proteinopathy compared to 29% in controls. Interestingly, α-Syn aggregation correlated with Htt, TDP-43 and phosphorylated-Tau in HD but not in controls. The impact of this work is twofold: (1) it provides compelling evidences that Tau, α-Syn and TDP-43 proteinopathies are increased in HD, and (2) it suggests the involvement of common mechanisms leading to abnormal accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins in NDD. Further studies will be needed to decipher the impact of these proteinopathies on clinical manifestation of HD."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by movement disorder, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline.", "answer_start": 176}], "question": "Is Huntington's disease caused by a dominate or recessive gene?", "id": "5e31cbd4fbd6abf43b00004f_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Sirtuins and their pharmacological activators/inhibitors have been associated with a range of neuroprotective effects or disease modifying influences in neurological disorders.

Most recently, sex chromosome abnormalities and skewed X chromosome inactivation have been suggested as novel players, particularly in later-onset diseases.

One of the major shared features among AID is the predominance in the female sex which in some cases changes with the age at disease diagnosis. Numerous hypotheses have been formulated based on intuitive scientific backgrounds to justify this sex imbalance, i.e. sex hormones and reproductive factors, fetal microchimerism, other sex-related environmental factors, a skewing of the X-chromosome inactivation patterns, and major defects in sex chromosomes. Nevertheless, none of these hypotheses has thus far gathered enough convincing evidence and in most cases data are conflicting, as well illustrated by the reports on fetal microchimerism in systemic sclerosis or primary biliary cirrhosis. The present article will critically discuss the main hypotheses (loss of mosaicism, reactivation, and haploinsufficiency) that have been proposed based on findings in female patients with specific AID along with two additional mechanisms (X-chromosome vulnerability and X-linked polyamine genes) that have been observed in AID models. Further, recent data have significantly shifted the paradigm of X chromosome inactivation by demonstrating that a large number of genes can variably escape silencing on one or both chromosomes. As a result we may hypothesize that more than one mechanism may contribute to the female susceptibility to tolerance breakdown while the possibility that unknown factors may indeed protect men from AID should not be overlooked."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " The gut microbiome, which impacts the innate and adaptive branches of immunity, not only influences the development of autoimmune disorders but may interact with sex-hormones to modulate disease progression and sex-bias.", "answer_start": 430}], "question": "Are male or female persons more prone to autoimmunity?", "id": "5cebf83ea49efeb44c00000a_010", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis are multifactorial in nature, requiring both genetic and environmental factors for onset.

Management of these conditions therefore relies on controlling serum uric acid levels. ATP-binding cassette transporter, sub-family G, member 2 (ABCG2/BCRP) is a well-studied urate transporter expressed on apical membranes in several tissues, including the intestine, liver, and kidney. Here, we discuss the potential of future gout therapies targeting ABCG2. Areas covered: ABCG2 regulates serum uric acid via physiologically important roles in both renal and extra-renal urate excretion. ABCG2 dysfunction, which promotes onset of hyperuricemia, often results in decreased urate excretion through the extra-renal (principally intestinal), rather than the renal pathway. This review covers recent attempts to establish the basis of ABCG2 function according to genetic diathesis, its molecular structure, and the effects of medication. Furthermore, the possibility of treating gout and hyperuricemia by upregulating intestinal ABCG2 expression is examined. Expert opinion: ABCG2 holds great promise as a therapeutic target for these conditions, particularly considering its involvement in extra-renal urate excretion. Manipulation of ABCG2, including controlling the level and location of its expression, has the potential to prevent gout by promoting uric acid excretion as effectively as general uricosuric drugs.ABBREVIATIONS: ATP-binding cassette (ABC), transmembrane domain (TMD), nucleotide binding domain (NBD), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "the discovery that ABCG2 plays a central role on extra-renal uric acid excretion,", "answer_start": 248}], "question": "Is the protein ABCG2 (ATP-Binding Cassette, subfamily G, member 2, transporter) excreting uric acid?", "id": "5e5b5c6fb761aafe0900000a_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Over the last decade, there have been major advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of hyperuricaemia and gout as well as of the pharmacogenetics of urate-lowering therapy.

Over 200 G1/S genes are regulated by either one of the two TF complexes, SBF and MBF, which bind to specific DNA binding sequences, SCB and MCB, respectively. The difference in size and complexity of the G1/S transcriptional network across yeast species makes it well suited to investigate how TF paralogs (SBF and MBF) and DNA binding sequences (SCB and MCB) co-evolved after gene duplication to rewire and expand the network of G1/S target genes.

G1/S network expansion took place by both cis- and trans- co-evolutionary changes in closely related but distinct regulatory sequences.

HH type 3, which is of intermediate severity, is caused by bi-allelic mutations of TFR2 that encodes transferrin receptor 2. Mutations of SLC40A1 that encodes ferroportin, the only cellular iron exporter, causes either HH type 4A (loss-of-function mutations) or HH type 4B (gain-of-function mutations). Studies on these gene products uncovered a part of the mechanisms of the systemic iron regulation; HFE, hemojuvelin, and TFR2 are involved in iron sensing and stimulating hepcidin expression, and hepcidin downregulates the expression of ferroportin of the target cells. Phlebotomy is the standard treatment for HH, and early initiation of the treatment is essential for preventing irreversible organ damage. However, because of the rarity and difficulty in making the genetic diagnosis, a large proportion of patients with non-HFE HH might have been undiagnosed; therefore, awareness of this disorder is important."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "hereditary hemochromatosis, an autosomal dominant iron overload condition with variable phenotypic manifestations.

Clinical penetrance is low, however those afflicted may develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomyopathy. Treatment of HH involves regular phlebotomy to reduce the systemic iron burden. In many countries-including the United States-numerous blood centers do not accept donated blood obtained from HH patients during therapeutic phlebotomy and there are inconsistent positions regarding this globally. This refusal of blood is borne out of a few concerns. First, there is a theoretical increase in the infectious risk of these blood products, particularly by siderophilic organisms such as Yersinia enterocolitica. Second, given the increased incidence of hepatitis C infection from nonvoluntary donors in the 1970s, there is a concern that blood units from HH donors may harbor additional risk given the nonvoluntary nature of their presentation. In this review, we examine the existing biological and clinical data concerning infectious risk and summarize clinical experience from centers allowing HH donors, and demonstrate that blood from HH patients is safe and should be allowed into the donor pool.

Adult intestinal mal-rotation is a rare condition of deviation from the normal 270° counter clockwise rotation of the midgut resulting in, not only mal-position of the small intestine, but also mal-fixation of the mesentery. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a rare complication of pelvic inflammatory disease; it involves liver capsule inflammation associated with genital tract infection, which is usually caused by Neisseria gonorrhoea and Chlamydia trachomatis. Neuroendocrine tumors are enterochromaffin cell neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems; the appendicular one is the most common primary malignant lesion of these tumors, it's incidence is about 0.3 - 0.9% of appendectomies done. Just for knowledge, this is the first described case of concomitant presence of all these diseases with clinical symptoms attributable to each one.CASE PRESENTATION: 40-years-old woman suffers from acute abdominal pain, predominantly on the right quadrants, without abdominal distension, no guarding nor rigidity and normal intestinal peristalsis. She has a long history of abdominal intermittent pain, with cramps every 30-40 min, resolving spontaneously. She was diagnosed as intestinal mal-rotation through computed tomography scan which has evidenced a mobilized intra--peritoneal duodenum with cecum/ascending colon predominately lying on the left side and the small intestine almost entirely lying on the right side of abdomen, without evidence of effusion, edema or signs of intestinal ischemia or infarction. Exploratory laparoscopy demonstrated an inflammatory process in the hepatic-renal space, with bloody adhesions above the liver capsule; this is additional to the typical pelvic inflammatory disease signs (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome). Appendectomy was performed with histological analysis resulting in appendicular neuroendocrine tumor.CONCLUSIONS: Although the patient has an intestinal mal-rotation which could explain the abdominal painful symptoms, it is not possible to exclude other concomitant causes, such as perihepatitis on pelvic inflammatory disease or neuroendocrine tumors. Even if all these diseases are rarely seen in daily clinical practice, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic intermittent abdominal pain in a young woman."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Extensive changes in DNA methylation are common in cancer and may contribute to oncogenesis through transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Are lamina-associated domains (LADs) associated with transcriptional activation?", "id": "5cf4dec0a49efeb44c00000c_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Extensive changes in DNA methylation are common in cancer and may contribute to oncogenesis through transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes.

The authors review the evolution of treatment approaches in the ILDs, informed by recent placebo-controlled trials, and discuss current clinical trials in which emerging pathogenetic mechanisms are targeted as novel therapeutic agents.AREAS COVERED: In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), recent randomised, placebo-controlled trials have tested the efficacy of new therapies, and although primary end points have not been met in most, treatment effects have been observed. The demonstration of harmful effects from widely used IPF therapies has been equally important. Pirfenidone and nintedanib are emerging agents that exert pleiotropic effects, reflective of the multiple mechanistic pathways of IPF. Treatment may necessitate a similarly multifaceted approach using combination regimens of antifibrotic and antioxidant agents in order to be effective. In other ILDs, including systemic sclerosis, other connective tissue diseases and pulmonary sarcoidosis, the inflammatory/fibrotic model remains appropriate. Studies in systemic sclerosis have provided 'proof of concept' data for immunosuppressive therapy in the prevention of disease progression but there is a continuing need for controlled clinical trials in the more prevalent ILDs.EXPERT OPINION: In IPF, significant treatment effects have been reported with pirfenidone, nintedanib and N-acetylcysteine. Combinations of these pleiotropic agents, along with future monotherapies, in 'oncological regimens' may hold the key to more effective IPF treatment. In disorders other than IPF, there is an ongoing need for the controlled evaluation of traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies. 'Cohort enrichment' (the selective recruitment of patients most likely to progress) holds the key to the identification of worthwhile treatment benefits."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The SENSCIS™ trial is a randomised, placebo-controlled Phase III trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with SSc-ILD (NCT02597933).", "answer_start": 377}], "question": "Does nintedanib hold promise for lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis?", "id": "5e30f76afbd6abf43b000046_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVES: Nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

The initial diagnosis of SARS was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. During the outbreak, molecular and serologic tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) became available. However, without a \"gold standard,\" it was impossible to determine the usefulness of these tests. We describe how these tests were used during the first phase of the SARS outbreak in Toronto and offer some recommendations that may be useful if SARS returns.METHODS: We examined the results of all diagnostic laboratory tests used in 117 patients admitted to hospitals in Toronto who met the Health Canada criteria for suspect or probable SARS. Focusing on tests for SARS-CoV, we attempted to determine the optimal specimen types and timing of specimen collection.RESULTS: Diagnostic test results for SARS-CoV were available for 110 of the 117 patients. SARS-CoV was detected by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in at least one specimen in 59 (54.1%) of 109 patients. Serologic test results of convalescent samples were positive in 50 (96.2%) of 52 patients for whom paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. Of the 110 patients, 78 (70.9%) had specimens that tested positive by means of RT-PCR, serologic testing or both methods. The proportion of RT-PCR test results that were positive was similar between patients who met the criteria for suspect SARS (50.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.4%-63.2%) and those who met the criteria for probable SARS (58.0%, 95% CI 44.2%-70.7%). SARS-CoV was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs in 33 (32.4%) of 102 patients, in stool specimens in 19 (63.3%) of 30 patients, and in specimens from the lower respiratory tract in 10 (58.8%) of 17 patients.INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that the rapid diagnostic tests in use at the time of the initial outbreak lack sufficient sensitivity to be used clinically to rule out SARS. As tests for SARS-CoV continue to be optimized, evaluation of the clinical presentation and elucidation of a contact history must remain the cornerstone of SARS diagnosis. In patients with SARS, specimens taken from the lower respiratory tract and stool samples test positive by means of RT-PCR more often than do samples taken from other areas."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Encorafenib (LGX818) is a promising BRAFV600E inhibitor that has efficacy against metastatic melanoma.

Inhibitors selective for the BRAFV600E oncoprotein, the most common BRAF mutant, elicit only poor response rates in BRAF-mutant CRC as single agents. This unresponsiveness was mechanistically attributed to the loss of negative feedbacks on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and initiated clinical trials that combine BRAF (and MEK) inhibitors, either singly or in combination, with the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab. First results of these combinatorial studies demonstrated improved efficacy, however, the response rates still were heterogeneous. Here, we show that BRAF inhibition leads to the upregulation of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in CRC cell lines, including not only the EGFR, but also human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER3. Importantly, combination of the BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) vemurafenib (PLX4032), dabrafenib, or encorafenib with inhibitors dually targeting the EGFR and HER2 (such as lapatinib, canertinib, and afatinib) significantly reduced the metabolic activity and proliferative potential of CRC cells.

Interestingly, BRAF inhibitors did not only upregulate RTKs, but also increased the abundance of the GRB2-associated binders (Gab) 1 and Gab2, two important amplifiers of RTK signaling. An allele-specific shRNA-mediated knockdown of BRAFV600E revealed that Gab2 upregulation was directly dependent on the loss of the oncoprotein and was not caused by an \"off-target\" effect of these kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, Gab2 and Gab2-mediated Shp2 signaling were shown to be functionally important in BRAFi resistance.

We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced BRAFV600-mutant melanoma.METHODS: COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy. In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group).

The most common grade 3-4 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were increased γ-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients).

We identify the histone H3-H4 chaperone Spt6 as the factor that mediates nucleosome reassembly onto the PHO5, PHO8, ADH2, ADY2, and SUC2 promoters during transcriptional repression. Furthermore, promoter nucleosome reassembly is essential for transcriptional repression. In the absence of Spt6-mediated nucleosome reassembly, the activators Pho4 and Pho2 are displaced from the PHO5 promoter in repressing conditions, yet transcription is sustained. As such, these studies demonstrate that activators are not required for transcription in the absence of competing chromatin reassembly."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Previous characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 proteins suggested that these proteins act as transcription factors that modify chromatin structure.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the function of the Spt6 gene in yeast?", "id": "5cf619a8a49efeb44c000010_008", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Previous characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 proteins suggested that these proteins act as transcription factors that modify chromatin structure.

We have isolated conditional mutations in SPT5 that can be suppressed in an allele-specific manner by mutations in the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Strikingly, one of these RNA Pol II mutants is defective for transcription elongation and the others cause phenotypes consistent with an elongation defect. In addition, we show that spt4, spt5, and spt6 mutants themselves have phenotypes suggesting defects in transcription elongation in vivo. Consistent with these findings, we show that Spt5 is physically associated with RNA Pol II in vivo, and have identified a region of sequence similarity between Spt5 and NusG, an Escherichia coli transcription elongation factor that binds directly to RNA polymerase. Finally, we show that Spt4 and Spt5 are tightly associated in a complex that does not contain Spt6.

HTA1-lacZ transcription was reduced in each spt mutant background, an effect that required a negative site in the HTA1 promoter. The transcriptional effect could be reversed by the overproduction of histones H2A and H2B in an spt4 mutant and histones H3 and H4 in all three spt mutants. Suppression of the spt4 transcriptional defect was dependent on the overproduction of both histones H2A and H2B, and required the presence of N-terminal amino acids in both histones.

This often occurs in response to injury or inflammation, leading to joint immobilization and significant disability. There are currently no definitive treatment options for this devastating disease. Although the most dramatic phenotype in FOP is the episodic and progressive heterotopic ossification, patients report a number of symptoms that affect other organ systems. Post-mortem examination of FOP patients may contribute to our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and complications of this disease. Here, we present the autopsy findings from three patients with FOP.FINDINGS: Autopsy findings in two of the three patients confirmed that the cause of death was cardiorespiratory failure in the setting of severe thoracic insufficiency from heterotopic ossification. Both of these patients also had evidence of right ventricular dilatation likely secondary to thoracic insufficiency. The third patient died from complications of a traumatic head injury after a fall but also had post-mortem evidence of thoracic insufficiency syndrome. All three patients had extensive, widespread heterotopic ossification and joint deformities consistent with FOP. There was extensive ossification of the spinal ligament in these patients, which may contribute to cervical spine rigidity. One patient was diagnosed post-mortem with a brainstem malformation. No additional significant abnormalities were noted in the other organ systems. Finally, we also demonstrate that cadaveric skin fibroblasts can be isolated for use as a potential source for future in vitro cell culture studies.CONCLUSIONS: This autopsy case series provides valuable information about the underlying complications of FOP and contributes significantly to our knowledge of this rare yet debilitating disorder. Thoracic insufficiency syndrome, right heart dysfunction, widespread heterotopic ossification, spinal ligament ossification, and CNS malformations were clearly evident; however, most other non-bone tissues appeared to be spared from gross malformations. Finally, the ability to isolate live cells from cadaveric skin is an important technique that will facilitate future studies, particularly as induced pluripotent stem cells and other cell-based technologies evolve. This case series highlights the importance of post-mortem examinations and their contribution to our current knowledge of disease pathophysiology and comorbidities.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To better ascertain the frequency and characteristics of osteocartilaginous exostoses in FOP disease, we conducted a cross-sectional radiological study based on all the traceable cases identified in a previous comprehensive national research. Metaphyseal exostoses were present in all the 17 cases of FOP studied. Although most often arising from the distal femoral (where metaphyseal exostoses adopt a peculiar not yet reported appearance) and proximal tibial bones, we have found that they are not restricted to these areas, but rather can be seen scattered at a variety of other skeletal sites. Using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, we show that these exophytic outgrowths are true osteochondromas. As a whole, these results are in agreement with data coming from the literature review. Our study confirms the presence of metaphyseal osteochondromas as a very frequent trait of FOP phenotype and an outstanding feature of its anomalous skeletal developmental component.

In this disease, HO can occur in discrete flares, often triggered by injury or inflammation, or may progress incrementally without identified triggers. Mice harboring an Acvr1R206H knock-in allele recapitulate the phenotypic spectrum of FOP, including injury-responsive intramuscular HO and spontaneous articular, tendon, and ligament ossification. The cells that drive HO in these diverse tissues can be compartmentalized into two lineages: an Scx+ tendon-derived progenitor that mediates endochondral HO of ligaments and joints without exogenous injury, and a muscle-resident interstitial Mx1+ population that mediates intramuscular, injury-dependent endochondral HO. Expression of Acvr1R206H in either lineage confers aberrant gain of BMP signaling and chondrogenic differentiation in response to activin A and gives rise to mutation-expressing hypertrophic chondrocytes in HO lesions. Compared to Acvr1R206H, expression of the man-made, ligand-independent ACVR1Q207D mutation accelerates and increases the penetrance of all observed phenotypes, but does not abrogate the need for antecedent injury in muscle HO, demonstrating the need for an injury factor in addition to enhanced BMP signaling. Both injury-dependent intramuscular and spontaneous ligament HO in Acvr1R206H knock-in mice were effectively controlled by the selective ACVR1 inhibitor LDN-212854. Thus, diverse phenotypes of HO found in FOP are rooted in cell-autonomous effects of dysregulated ACVR1 signaling in nonoverlapping tissue-resident progenitor pools that may be addressed by systemic therapy or by modulating injury-mediated factors involved in their local recruitment."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "RESULTS: Meningioma was the most common tumor among clinically diagnosed tumors, followed by neuroepithelial tumor, schwannoma, and pituitary tumor.

Trichostatin A and MS-275 (both HDAC inhibitors) inhibited the downstream pathway of HDAC1 and caused cell growth arrest via activation of p53 and p21; the effects of digoxigenin were totally opposite. Staurosporine blocked the cell cycle via p53 and p21, but also promoted cell growth via activated HDAC1 and its downstream pathway. Our approach was also applied to the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, and the cross-validation analysis showed very good accuracy in predicting effects of 4 compounds.

Exosomes from N2a cells expressing human APP with the autosomal dominant Swedish mutation contain Aβ peptides as well as CTF-α and CTF-η, while those from cells expressing the non-mutated form of APP only contain CTF-α and CTF-η.

Thus, neuroblastoma cells secrete distinct populations of exosomes carrying different cargoes and targeting specific cell types. APP-carrying exosomes can be endocytosed by receiving cells, allowing the processing of APP acquired by exosomes to give rise to the APP intracellular domain (AICD).

They can transfer information between cells and may cause pathology, for example, a role for exosomes has been proposed in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Although studied in several biofluids, exosomes have not been extensively studied in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from humans. The objective of this study was to determine: 1) whether human CSF contains exosomes and 2) the variability in exosomal protein content across individuals.METHODS: CSF was collected from 5 study participants undergoing thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (around 200 - 500 ml per participant) and low-density membrane vesicles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The presence of exosomes was determined by western blot for marker proteins, isopycnic centrifugation on a sucrose step gradient and transmission electron microscopy with immuno-labelling. Whole protein profiling was performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR).RESULTS: Flotillin 1 and tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), two exosomal marker proteins, were identified in the ultracentrifugation pellet using western blot. These markers localized to a density consistent with exosomes following isopycnic centrifugation. Transmission electron microscopy visualized structures consistent with exosomes in size and appearance that labelled positive for flotillin 1. Therefore, the pellet that resulted from ultracentrifugation of human CSF contained exosomes. FT-ICR profiling of this pellet was performed and 84-161 ions were detected per study participant. Around one third of these ions were only present in a single study participant and one third were detected in all five. With regard to ion quantity, the median coefficient of variation was 81% for ions detected in two or more samples.CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes were identified in human CSF and their proteome is a potential new reservoir for biomarker discovery in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, techniques used to concentrate exosomes from CSF need refinement to reduce variability.

Those with a level of tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of at least 1% were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab monotherapy, or chemotherapy; those with a tumor PD-L1 expression level of less than 1% were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy. Tumor mutational burden was determined by the FoundationOne CDx assay.RESULTS: Progression-free survival among patients with a high tumor mutational burden was significantly longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy. The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 42.6% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 13.2% with chemotherapy, and the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 13.2) versus 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.4 to 5.8) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 97.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.81; P<0.001).

Previous studies have shown that SETDB1 can trimethylate H3 on lysine 9, using in vitro or artificial tethering assays. SETDB1 is thought to be recruited to chromatin by complexes containing the KAP1 corepressor. To determine if a KAP1-containing complex mediates trimethylation of the identified H3me3K9 targets, we performed ChIP-chip assays and identified KAP1 target genes using human 5-kb promoter arrays. We found that a large number of genes of ZNF transcription factors were bound by both KAP1 and H3me3K9 in normal and cancer cells. To expand our studies of KAP1, we next performed a complete genomic analysis of KAP1 binding using a 38-array tiling set, identifying ~7,000 KAP1 binding sites. The identified KAP1 targets were highly enriched for C2H2 ZNFs, especially those containing Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domains. Interestingly, although most KAP1 binding sites were within core promoter regions, the binding sites near ZNF genes were greatly enriched within transcribed regions of the target genes. Because KAP1 is recruited to the DNA via interaction with KRAB-ZNF proteins, we suggest that expression of KRAB-ZNF genes may be controlled via an auto-regulatory mechanism involving KAP1."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B)", "answer_start": 14}], "question": "What is another name for acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)?", "id": "5e36dc8cb5b409ea5300000d_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "INTRODUCTION: Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B).METHODS: Retrospective multicentric analysis of French adult patients with ASMD over the period 1985-March 2015. Clinical, biological, and imaging data were analyzed.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (19 males, 9 females) were analyzed. Diagnosis was made before the age of 10 years in 16 cases. Main symptoms at diagnosis were spleen/liver enlargement and interstitial lung disease. Biological abnormalities included: thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 000/mm3) in 24 cases including 4 patients with platelet count <60 000/mm3, constantly low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (n=6), monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (n=5), normal prothrombin level discordant with low factor V (n=5), elevated chitotriosidase level (n=11). The diagnosis was confirmed in all cases by deficient acid sphingomyelinase enzyme activity. SMPD1 gene sequencing was performed in 25 cases. The frequent p.R610del mutation was largely predominant, constituting 62% of the non-related alleles. During the follow-up period, three patients died before 50 years of age from cirrhosis, heart failure and lung insufficiency, respectively.CONCLUSION: ASMD in adulthood (NP-B) associates spleen/liver enlargement and interstitial lung disease.

NPD A is associated with a uniformly devastating disease course, with rapidly progressing psychomotor degeneration, leading to death typically by the age of 3 years, most often from respiratory failure. In contrast, the clinical phenotype and life expectancy of patients with NPD B may vary widely. Almost all patients have hepatosplenomegaly and an atherogenic lipid profile, and most patients have interstitial lung disease with progressive impairment of pulmonary function and hematologic abnormalities including cytopenias. Other common clinical manifestations include liver dysfunction, heart disease, skeletal abnormalities and growth delays. Some patients with ASMD who survive beyond early childhood have intermediate phenotypes (variant NPD B) characterized by combinations of non-neurologic and mild to severe neurologic symptoms. The physical and psychosocial burden of illness in patients with NPD B is substantial. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, joint or limb pain, abdominal pain, bleeding and bruising. The disease often leads to chronic fatigue, limited physical or social activity and difficulties in performing daily activities or work. Many patients die before or in early adulthood, often from pneumonia/respiratory failure or liver failure. Available treatments are limited to symptom management and supportive care.

Autoimmunity directed against pancreatic islet cells results in slowly progressive selective beta-cell destruction (\"Primary autoimmune insulitis\"), culminating over years in clinically manifested insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Circulating serum autoantibodies directed against the endocrine cells of the islets of Langerhans (Islet cell autoantibodies - ICAb) are an important hallmark of this disease. Assays for islet cell autoantibodies have facilitated the investigation and understanding of several facets in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. Their applications have extended into clinical practice and have opened new avenues for early preclinical prediction and preventive prophylaxis in IDDM/type 1 DM. Recently, surprisingly, differences in insulin content between T1DM islets, as well as, 'patchy' or 'lobular' destruction of islets have been described. These unique pathobiological phenomena, suggest that beta cell destruction may not always be inexorable and inevitably complete/total, and thus raise hopes for possible therapeutic interruption of beta cell autoimmunity - destruction and cure of type 1 diabetes. \"Recurrent or secondary autoimmune insulitis\" refers to the rapid reappearance of islet cell autoantibodies post pancreas transplant, and selective islet beta cell destruction in the grafted pancreas [never forgetting or \"anamnestic\" beta cell destructive memory], in the absence of any graft pancreas rejection [monozygotic twin to twin transplantation]. The one definite environmental factor is congenital rubella, because of which a subset of children subsequently develop type 1 diabetes. The putative predisposing factors are viruses, gluten and cow's milk. The putative protective factors include gut flora, helminths, viral infections, and Vitamin D. Prevention of T1DM can include: Primary prevention strategies before the development of autoantibodies and Secondary prevention regimens after autoantibody development. Once islet cell autoantibodies have developed, the goal is to establish a therapeutic regimen to preserve at least 90% of the beta cells, and prevent the development of hyperglycaemia. The targets for T1DM reversal should include autoimmunity, beta cell regeneration and protection of beta cell mass.

In this phase 3 trial, we assessed the safety and efficacy of one such antibody, teplizumab.METHODS: In this 2-year trial, patients aged 8-35 years who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for 12 weeks or fewer were enrolled and treated at 83 clinical centres in North America, Europe, Israel, and India. Participants were allocated (2:1:1:1 ratio) by an interactive telephone system, according to computer-generated block randomisation, to receive one of three regimens of teplizumab infusions (14-day full dose, 14-day low dose, or 6-day full dose) or placebo at baseline and at 26 weeks. The Protégé study is still underway, and patients and study staff remain masked through to study closure. The primary composite outcome was the percentage of patients with insulin use of less than 0·5 U/kg per day and glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1C)) of less than 6·5% at 1 year. Analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00385697.FINDINGS: 763 patients were screened, of whom 516 were randomised to receive 14-day full-dose teplizumab (n=209), 14-day low-dose teplizumab (n=102), 6-day full-dose teplizumab (n=106), or placebo (n=99). Two patients in the 14-day full-dose group and one patient in the placebo group did not start treatment, so 513 patients were eligible for efficacy analyses. The primary outcome did not differ between groups at 1 year: 19·8% (41/207) in the 14-day full-dose group; 13·7% (14/102) in the 14-day low-dose group; 20·8% (22/106) in the 6-day full-dose group; and 20·4% (20/98) in the placebo group. 5% (19/415) of patients in the teplizumab groups were not taking insulin at 1 year, compared with no patients in the placebo group at 1 year (p=0·03). Across the four study groups, similar proportions of patients had adverse events (414/417 [99%] in the teplizumab groups vs 98/99 [99%] in the placebo group) and serious adverse events (42/417 [10%] vs 9/99 [9%]). The most common clinical adverse event in the teplizumab groups was rash (220/417 [53%] vs 20/99 [20%] in the placebo group).INTERPRETATION: Findings of exploratory analyses suggest that future studies of immunotherapeutic intervention with teplizumab might have increased success in prevention of a decline in β-cell function (measured by C-peptide) and provision of glycaemic control at reduced doses of insulin if they target patients early after diagnosis of diabetes and children.FUNDING: MacroGenics, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, and Eli Lilly.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
