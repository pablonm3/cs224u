This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate the clinical utility, validity and reliability of the outcome measures and tools used to quantify lower limb changes within studies that included children with ITW.METHODS: The following databases were searched from inception until March 2018: Ovid MEDLINE, EBESCO, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PubMed. Inclusion criteria were studies including children with ITW diagnosis, reporting use of measurement tools or methods describing lower limb characteristics, published in peer-reviewed journals, and in English. The relevant psychometric properties of measurement tools were extracted, and assessed for reported reliability and validity. Included articles were assessed for risk of bias using McMaster quality assessment tool. Results were descriptively synthesized and logistic regression used to determine associations between common assessments.RESULTS: From 3164 retrieved studies, 37 full texts were screened and 27 full texts included. There were 27 different measurement tools described across joint range of motion measurement, gait analysis, electromyography, accelerometer, strength, neurological or radiology assessment. Interventional studies were more likely to report range of motion and gait analysis outcomes, than observational studies. Alvarez classification tool in conjunction with Vicon motion system appeared the contemporary choice for describing ITW gait. There was no significant association between the use of range of motion and gait analysis outcomes and any other outcome tool or assessment in all studies (p > 0.05).There was limited reliability and validity reporting for many outcome measures.SIGNIFICANCE: This review highlighted that a consensus statement should be considered to guide clinicians and researchers in the choice of the most important outcome measures for this population. Having a standard set of measures will enable future treatment trials to collect similar measures thus allowing future systematic reviews to compare results.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The diagnosis is clinical, making it necessary to rule out other neurological and orthopaedic conditions. A relationship between ITW and vestibular dysfunction and/or proprioceptive sensibility has been proposed. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders (autism, language and cognitive disorders) often have ITW.OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of ITW in children with attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity (ADHD).PATIENTS AND METHOD: A study was conducted on children diagnosed with ADHD, with normal neurological examination, with no alterations in MRI scan, cognitive disorder or autism. A complete clinical anamnesis was performed and Achilles shortening was measured with a goniometer.RESULTS: The study included 312 children with a mean age of 11 years (73.7% boys). The ADHD combined subtype was the most frequent (53.8%), followed by the inattentive (44.9%), and hyperactive (1.3%). ITW was observed in 20.8% of patients, particularly in the combined subtype (P=.054). Only 32 of them (49.2%) had Achilles shortening. ITW was associated with sociability disorders (P=.01), absence of pain in legs (P=.022), and family history of ITW (P=.004). Only 11% had previously visited a doctor for this reason.CONCLUSIONS: As in other neurodevelopmental disorders, children with ADHD have frequently more ITW and Achilles shortening than controls, especially if they presented with a social communication disorder or a family history of ITW. An early diagnosis is essential to establish effective treatments.Copyright © 2016 Asociación Española de Pediatría. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.

At the group level, the H-reflex properties did not differ, but at the individual level, in 7 of 25 idiopathic toe walkers, some of the H-reflex parameters fell out of normal limits of typically developing children. However, the H-reflex was suppressed by vibration to the Achilles tendon similarly in both the idiopathic toe walkers and typically developing children.

This condition often causes parental concern, with repeated medical contacts and a range of interventions including stretching, casts, injection of botulinum toxin A, and surgical procedures. The purpose of this cohort study was to document the natural history of this condition.METHODS: In a population-based cohort of 1,401 healthy 5.5-year-old Swedish children, we found the prevalence of idiopathic toe-walking to be approximately 5% (63 of 1,401). Of the 63 children who had ever been a toe-walker, 26 still were at the age of 5.5 years and were followed in the current study at 8 and 10 years of age. At the 8-year follow-up, parents were asked by telephone whether their child had received any treatment or diagnosis since the 5.5-year assessment, as well as to what extent (approximately 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the time) the child still walked on the toes. At the visit when the children were 10 years of age, their parents were asked the same questions. All 26 children also underwent a neurological examination and an orthopaedic examination focusing on the lower extremities.RESULTS: At 8 years of age, 6 of 26 children had ceased toe-walking, and by the age of 10 years, 50 (79%) of the original 63 patients had spontaneously ceased toe-walking. Idiopathic toe-walking did not result in contractures of the triceps surae. One subgroup of children displayed early contracture of the ankle and should thus not be considered idiopathic toe-walkers. Four of the children who still toe-walked at the age of 10 years demonstrated some neurodevelopmental comorbidity.CONCLUSIONS: By the age of 10 years, 79% of the children who have ever been a toe-walker spontaneously develop a typical gait, without intervention or contractures of the ankle dorsiflexion. The diagnosis of short tendo Achilles should be retained as a separate diagnosis as there is a subset of children with this entity who should be treated early in childhood. Neurodevelopmental comorbidities are common among those who continue to toe-walk.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level I.

Treatment for toe walking includes physical therapy, orthotics, casting, Botulinum Toxin A injection into gastrocnemius/soleus muscles, and/or surgery; yet, little evidence exists regarding long-term treatment effects.RESEARCH QUESTION: The objective of this study was to explore the differences in longer-term gait outcomes and severity of idiopathic toe walking between children treated actively with casting or inactively following recommendations for stretching.METHODS: Forty-three adolescents and young adults (14.3-28.8 years; 21 females, 22 males) who had participated in an idiopathic toe walking classification study as children, returned for repeat physical examination and three-dimensional computerized gait analysis (13.4 years follow-up, range 9.4-17.8 years); 23 participants had received active treatment with casting and ankle foot orthotics ± Botulinum Toxin A injection as children and 20 participants had received inactive treatment with recommended stretching exercises. Gait analysis data were compared retrospectively from baseline to follow-up using analysis of variance; toe walking severity was compared using a Wilcoxin Signed-Rank Sums test.RESULTS: Ankle angle at initial contact, peak dorsiflexion in stance, and toe walking severity improved significantly in the active treatment group only at follow-up. Significant improvement in peak ankle power and timing of ankle kinematics and kinetics in the gait cycle were found in both groups; however, greater changes occurred in the active treatment group. Both groups showed significantly improved internal plantar flexor moments, whereas knee extension increased in stance and passive ankle dorsiflexion decreased in both groups at follow-up (p = 0.001). Intermittent toe walking was reported in 49% (21/43) of participants at follow-up.SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study suggest that improvement in ankle kinematic timing and ankle kinetic gait analysis variables is sustainable, independent of conservative treatment for idiopathic toe walking in childhood.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SATB1 binds to MARs within the MMTV provirus to repress transcription. To address the role of the nuclear matrix in SATB1-mediated repression, a series of SATB1 deletion constructs was used to determine protein localization. Wild-type SATB1 localized to the soluble nuclear, chromatin, and nuclear matrix fractions. Mutants lacking amino acids 224-278 had a greatly diminished localization to the nuclear matrix, suggesting the presence of a nuclear matrix targeting sequence (NMTS). Transient transfection experiments showed that NMTS fusions to green fluorescent protein or LexA relocalized these proteins to the nuclear matrix. Difficulties with previous assay systems prompted us to develop retroviral vectors to assess effects of different SATB1 domains on expression of MMTV proviruses or integrated reporter genes. SATB1 overexpression repressed MMTV transcription in the presence and absence of functional glucocorticoid receptor. Repression was alleviated by deletion of the NMTS, which did not affect DNA binding, or by deletion of the MAR-binding domain.

Recently, resources such as the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 database provide gene expression profiles induced by various chemical and genetic perturbations and thereby make it possible to analyze the relationship between compounds and gene targets at a genome-wide scale. Current approaches for comparing the expression profiles are based on pairwise connectivity mapping analysis. However, this method makes the simple assumption that the effect of a drug treatment is similar to knocking down its single target gene. Since many compounds can bind multiple targets, the pairwise mapping ignores the combined effects of multiple targets, and therefore fails to detect many potential targets of the compounds.RESULTS: We propose an algorithm to find sets of gene knock-downs that induce gene expression changes similar to a drug treatment. Assuming that the effects of gene knock-downs are additive, we propose a novel bipartite block-wise sparse multi-task learning model with super-graph structure (BBSS-MTL) for multi-target drug repositioning that overcomes the restrictive assumptions of connectivity mapping analysis.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method BBSS-MTL is more accurate for predicting potential drug targets than the simple pairwise connectivity mapping analysis on five datasets generated from different cancer cell lines.AVAILABILITY: The code can be obtained at http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/liminli/codes ."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and XIAP) ", "answer_start": 1002}], "question": "Is the protein MCL-1 anti-apoptotic?", "id": "5e6e8600c6a8763d23000002_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Fenvalerate (Fen), a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used in agricultural, domestic and veterinary applications. Fen induces abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis, which are linked to its hazardous effects. However, this view is controversial and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.

U937 cells were treated with 50 μm cadmium chloride (CdCl2 ) with or without Fen pretreatment at 1-50 μm. Apoptosis was evaluated by externalization of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bcl-2 family members were determined by western blot analysis. The results revealed that pretreatment with Fen at 20 μm for 12 hours significantly inhibited Cd-induced apoptosis. Decreased expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Noxa and Bid) and increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and XIAP) were observed after combined treatment with Fen and CdCl2 . Phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was increased, while phosphorylation of JNK was decreased by the combined treatment, compared with CdCl2 treatment alone. In conclusion, Fen decreased apoptotic sensitivity induced by Cd in U937 cells.

Despite of general chemotherapy, relapse and mortality are common, highlighting the need for the development of novel targeted drugs or combination of therapeutic regimens. Recently, several drugs that target the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, especially the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, have demonstrated notable therapeutic effects in relapsed/refractory patients, which indicate that pharmacological inhibition of BCR pathway holds promise in MCL treatment. Here, we have developed a novel irreversible BTK inhibitor, PLS-123, that has more potent and selective anti-tumor activity than ibrutinib in vitro and in vivo. Using in vitro screening, we discovered that the combination of PLS-123 and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus exert synergistic activity in attenuating proliferation and motility of MCL cell lines. Simultaneous inhibition of BTK and mTOR resulted in marked induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, which were accompanied by upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved PARP and Bax), repression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and XIAP), and downregulation of regulators of the G1/S phase transition (CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and Cyclin D1). Gene expression profile analysis revealed simultaneous treatment with these agents led to inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3, AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and SGK1 expression. Finally, the anti-tumor and pro-apoptotic activities of combination strategy have also been demonstrated using xenograft mice models.

Despite their similarities, there is emerging evidence for non-redundant roles of the circulating yet scarce basophils and tissue-resident mast cells, respectively. Because of their importance in allergic pathogenesis, specific induction of apoptosis in basophils and mast cells may represent an interesting novel treatment strategy. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-3 serves as a key factor for basophil and mouse mast cell survival. Interleukin-3 increases the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, such as BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1; however, little is known how strongly these individual proteins contribute to basophil survival. Here, we were applying small molecule inhibitors called BH3 mimetics, some of which show remarkable success in cancer treatments, to neutralize the function of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. We observed that expression levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins do not necessarily correlate with their respective importance for basophil survival. Whereas naive in vitro-differentiated mouse basophils efficiently died upon BCL-2 or BCL-XL inhibition, interleukin-3 priming rendered the cells highly resistant toward apoptosis, and this could only be overcome upon combined targeting of BCL-2 and BCL-XL. Of note, human basophils differed from mouse basophils as they depended on BCL-2 and MCL-1, but not on BCL-XL, for their survival at steady state. On the other hand, and in contrast to mouse basophils, MCL-1 proved critical in mediating survival of interleukin-3 stimulated mouse mast cells, whereas BCL-XL seemed dispensable. Taken together, our results indicate that by choosing the right combination of BH3 mimetic compounds, basophils and mast cells can be efficiently killed, even after stimulation with potent pro-survival cytokines such as interleukin-3. Because of the tolerable side effects of BH3 mimetics, targeting basophils or mast cells for apoptosis opens interesting possibilities for novel treatment approaches."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "CONTENT: Although CD19-targeted agents (blinatumomab or inebilizumab) are not associated with an increased risk of infection, they may cause IgG hypogammaglobulinaemia and neutropenia.", "answer_start": 443}], "question": "What is the target of Inebilizumab?", "id": "5e47681b35b8f0833c000006_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: The present review is part of the ESCMID Study Group for Infections in Compromised Hosts (ESGICH) Consensus Document on the safety of targeted and biological therapies.AIMS: To review, from an Infectious Diseases perspective, the safety profile of agents targeting CD19, CD20 and CD52 and to suggest preventive recommendations.SOURCES: Computer-based MEDLINE searches with MeSH terms pertaining to each agent or therapeutic family.CONTENT: Although CD19-targeted agents (blinatumomab or inebilizumab) are not associated with an increased risk of infection, they may cause IgG hypogammaglobulinaemia and neutropenia.

CD19 inhibition in mice reduced skin thickness, collagen production, and autoantibody levels, consistent with CD19 expression on plasma cells (PCs), the source of antibody production. PC depletion could effectively reduce collagen deposition and inflammation in SSc; therefore, we investigated the effects of PC depletion on SSc disease activity.METHODS: A PC gene signature was evaluated in SSc skin biopsy samples in 2 phase I clinical trials. We assessed microarray data from tissue from public studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), dermatomyositis (DM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and atopic dermatitis, as well as blood from a phase IIb clinical trial in SLE.RESULTS: The PC signature was elevated in SSc skin specimens compared to healthy donor skin (P = 2.28 × 10-6 ) and correlated with the baseline modified Rodnan skin thickness score (MRSS) (r = 0.64, P = 0.0004).

In this study, we confirm a high binding affinity and selectivity of S63845 to induce apoptosis in MCL-1-dependent cancer cell lines. Furthermore, S63845 synergizes with other BH3 mimetics to induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from both hematological and solid tumors. Although the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members in these cell lines interact with a spectrum of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins to regulate apoptosis, these interactions alone do not explain the relative sensitivities of these cell lines to BH3 mimetic-induced apoptosis. These findings necessitated further investigation into the requirement of BH3-only proteins in BH3 mimetic-mediated apoptosis. Concurrent inhibition of BCL-XL and MCL-1 by BH3 mimetics in colorectal HCT116 cells induced apoptosis in a BAX- but not BAK-dependent manner. Remarkably this apoptosis was independent of all known BH3-only proteins. Although BH3-only proteins were required for apoptosis induced as a result of BCL-XL inhibition, this requirement was overcome when both BCL-XL and MCL-1 were inhibited, implicating distinct mechanisms by which different anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members may regulate apoptosis in cancer."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " We tested the efficacy of the BH3 mimetic combination of A-1210477 (an MCL-1 inhibitor)", "answer_start": 462}], "question": "List Mcl-1 inhibitors.", "id": "5e6e8897c6a8763d23000003_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Despite the recent advancement in treating melanoma, options are still limited for patients without BRAF mutations or in relapse from current treatments. BH3 mimetics against members of the BCL-2 family have gained excitement with the recent success in hematological malignancies. However, single drug BH3 mimetic therapy in melanoma has limited effectiveness due to escape by the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 and/or survival of melanoma-initiating cells (MICs). We tested the efficacy of the BH3 mimetic combination of A-1210477 (an MCL-1 inhibitor) and ABT-263 (a BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor) in killing melanoma, especially MICs. We also sought to better define Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (DRP-1)'s role in melanoma; DRP-1 is known to interact with members of the BCL-2 family and is a possible therapeutic target for melanoma treatment. We used multiple assays (cell viability, apoptosis, bright field, immunoblot, and sphere formation), as well as the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing techniques. For clinical relevance, we employed patient samples of different mutation status, including some relapsed from current treatments such as anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We found the BH3 mimetic combination kill both the MICs and non-MICs (bulk of melanoma) in all cell lines and patient samples irrespective of the mutation status or relapsed state (p < 0.05). Unexpectedly, the major pro-apoptotic proteins, NOXA and BIM, are not necessary for the combination-induced cell death. Furthermore, the combination impedes the activation of DRP-1, and inhibition of DRP-1 further enhances apoptosis (p < 0.05). DRP-1 effects in melanoma differ from those seen in other cancer cells. These results provide new insights into BCL-2 family's regulation of the apoptotic pathway in melanoma, and suggest that inhibiting the major anti-apoptotic proteins is sufficient to induce cell death even without involvement from major pro-apoptotic proteins. Importantly, our study also indicates that DRP-1 inhibition is a promising adjuvant for BH3 mimetics in melanoma treatment."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "a highly specific MCL-1 inhibitor, S63845,", "answer_start": 150}], "question": "List Mcl-1 inhibitors.", "id": "5e6e8897c6a8763d23000003_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) is a prosurvival B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family member required for the sustained growth of many cancers.

Previous studies have shown that while treatment of NPC cells with Bcl-2 family inhibitors alone is rarely effective, concomitant treatment with a cytotoxic reagent such as cisplatin can increase efficacy through a synergistic effect. The aim of the current work was to determine how we might increase the efficacy of Bcl-2 family inhibitors in the absence of cytotoxic reagents, which are associated with negative side effect profiles.METHODS: We assessed cell proliferation in Bcl-2 high-expressing NPC cells by CCK-8 assay after treatment with the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 and/or the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845. Apoptotic induction by ABT-199 was evaluated by Annexin V-FITC and PI double staining. We also evaluated Bcl-2 family protein expression (Bim, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, Noxa) after treatment with ABT-199 by western blotting. Finally, xenografted Balb/c nude mice were used to test ABT-199 efficacy in vivo, H&E and immunohistochemistry assay were used to analyze tumor samples.RESULTS: ABT-199 effectively induced NPC cell apoptosis in vitro and in the xenograft model. Following ABT-199 treatment in NPC cells, upregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL can lead to drug resistance, while concomitant Noxa overexpression partially neutralized the Mcl-1-caused resistance. Given that ABT-199 induces apoptosis in NPC cells through the Bcl-2/Noxa/Mcl-1 axis, treatment avenues further targeting this pathway should be promising. Indeed, the newly developed Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 in combination with ABT-199 had a synergistic effect on NPC cell apoptosis.CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 inhibition in NPC cells with ABT-199 triggers apoptosis through the Bcl-2/Noxa/Mcl-1 axis, and dual inhibition of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 provided a strong synergistic effect without the need for adjunctive cytotoxic agent treatment with cisplatin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

BH3-mimetics that inhibit specific BCL-2 anti-apoptotic proteins may hold encouraging treatment outcomes for cervical cancer management. Hence, the aim of this pilot study is to investigate the sensitivity of cervical cancer cell lines to combination of two BH3-mimetics namely ABT-263 which selectively inhibits BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-w and A-1210477, a selective MCL-1 inhibitor.RESULTS: We report that combination of A-1210477 and ABT-263 exhibited synergistic effects on all cervical cancer cell lines tested. Drug sensitization studies revealed that A-1210477 sensitised the cervical cancer cell lines SiHa and CaSki to ABT-263 by 11- and fivefold, respectively. Sensitization also occurred in the opposite direction whereby ABT-263 sensitised SiHa and CaSki to A-1210477 by eightfold.

There is currently no effective treatment for this tumor. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is effective for a variety of tumors, but not for GBM. The authors' goal was to demonstrate that bortezomib can be effective in the orthotopic GBM murine model if the appropriate method of drug delivery is used. In this study the Alzet mini-osmotic pump was used to bring the drug directly to the tumor in the brain, circumventing the blood-brain barrier; thus making bortezomib an effective treatment for GBM. METHODS The 2 human glioma cell lines, U87 and U251, were labeled with luciferase and used in the subcutaneous and intracranial in vivo tumor models. Glioma cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank, or intracranially into the frontal cortex of athymic nude mice. Mice bearing intracranial glioma tumors were implanted with an Alzet mini-osmotic pump containing different doses of bortezomib. The Alzet pumps were introduced directly into the tumor bed in the brain. Survival was documented for mice with intracranial tumors. RESULTS Glioma cells were sensitive to bortezomib at nanomolar quantities in vitro. In the subcutaneous in vivo xenograft tumor model, bortezomib given intravenously was effective in reducing tumor progression. However, in the intracranial glioma model, bortezomib given systemically did not affect survival. By sharp contrast, animals treated with bortezomib intracranially at the tumor site exhibited significantly increased survival. CONCLUSIONS Bypassing the blood-brain barrier by using the osmotic pump resulted in an increase in the efficacy of bortezomib for the treatment of intracranial tumors. Thus, the intratumoral administration of bortezomib into the cranial cavity is an effective approach for glioma therapy."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " lncRNAs are defined as RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are not transcribed into proteins", "answer_start": 158}], "question": "How large is a lncRNAs?", "id": "5e6e8f92c6a8763d23000004_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Current evidence suggests that the human genome produces a large number of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

In the present study, we investigated not only the expression and clinicopathological significance of a novel lncRNA, NR_036575.1, in PTC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues but also its potential function in TPC1 cells. The expression levels of the lncRNA NR_036575.1 in 83 pairs of PTC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were detected via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The relationships between the expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics of the lncRNA NR_036575.1 were analysed. In addition, we established two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the diagnostic value of NR_036575.1 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 and transwell assays were used to assess cell proliferation and migration, respectively. The expression levels of the lncRNA NR_036575.1 were significantly higher in PTC tissues than in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. High NR_036575.1 expression was associated with extrathyroidal extension (ETE) (P = 0.011) and tumour size (P = 0.006). The ROC curves indicated that NR_036575.1 could potentially serve as a biomarker for identifying PTC and related, non-cancerous diseases (sensitivity, 80.7 %; specificity, 88 %), as well as for differentiating between PTC with or without ETE (sensitivity, 57.8 %; specificity, 86.7 %). NR_036575.1 knock-down significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of TPC1 cells. Our findings are the first to describe lncRNA NR_036575.1 overexpression in PTC.

Marimastat also has collagenase- and angiogenesis-inhibiting properties. British Biotech and Schering-Plough have signed an agreement enabling the latter to develop and market marimastat in North America and Europe. Under the terms of the agreement, British Biotech will receive an up-front license fee of 4 million US dollars and a 4 million US dollars equity investment in British Biotech by Schering-Plough. Schering-Plough holds rights to marimastat in all countries other than the Far East and Japan. The two companies are considering asking the FDA for accelerated approval in gastric cancer based on the secondary endpoint of progression-free survival. Marimastat is licensed to Tanabe Seiyaku in Japan, where phase II clinical trials are underway for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer and lung cancer. Further phase II trials in other tumour types are planned. The commencement of phase II trials in Japan resulted in a milestone payment of 5 million US dollars to British Biotech from Tanabe Seiyaku. Tanabe Seiyaku also holds rights to marimastat in the Far East. Marimastat has been in pivotal phase III trials in glioblastoma, breast, ovarian and small and non-small cell lung cancer, but these trials have all been discontinued because marimastat failed to show superior efficacy over either standard chemotherapy or placebo. Results from the marimastat 131 trial in patients with glioblastoma, for example, indicated that marimastat was no better than placebo at prolonging survival in these cancer patients. In June 2000, when the results of this study were released, shares in British Biotech fell 21.6% to just 19 pence per share. The phase III trial in small cell lung cancer was discontinued when the results of study 140 were released in February 2001 showing that marimastat was not significantly more effective than placebo in prolonging the survival of small cell lung cancer patients.

However, data collected during the follow-up period have shown increases in survival benefit in the treatment group in addition to a significant improvement in disease-free progression, the secondary endpoint of the trial. Development of marimastat for this indication is ongoing. In May 2001, British Biotech reported data from an interim analysis of results from the remaining phase III study in pancreatic cancer (study 183) that showed no patient benefit for marimastat recipients compared with gemcitabine.

Not all lung cancers express the MMPs believed to be most important in promoting the neoplastic process, and there are conflicting reports regarding the prognostic significance of MMPs in lung cancer.

Many investigators believe that MMPs are universally involved in tumor progression; this hypothesis was the basis for initiating seven phase III MMPI trials in lung cancer.

One of the earliest postzygotic isolating barriers to arise between incipient species is the sterility of the heterogametic sex in interspecies' hybrids. Four genes that underlie hybrid sterility have been identified in animals: Odysseus, JYalpha, and Overdrive in Drosophila and Prdm9 (Meisetz) in mice. Mouse Prdm9 encodes a protein with a KRAB motif, a histone methyltransferase domain and several zinc fingers. The difference of a single zinc finger distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid sterility from those that do not. We find that concerted evolution and positive selection have rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc fingers across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of positive selection in Prdm9 zinc fingers imply that rapid evolution has acted on the interface between the Prdm9 protein and the DNA sequences to which it binds. Similar patterns are apparent for Prdm9 zinc fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates. Indeed, allelic variation at the DNA-binding positions of human PRDM9 zinc fingers show significant association with decreased risk of infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a role in determining male sterility both between species (mouse) and within species (human). The recurrent episodes of positive selection acting on Prdm9 suggest that the DNA sequences to which it binds must also be evolving rapidly. Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying DNA sequences, but argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical model in which incompatibilities between Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite DNAs provide the molecular basis for Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility.

African governments fail to deliver vaccines to a significant percentage of the target population due to many issues in key areas such as policy setting, programme management and financing, supply chain, global vaccine market, research and development of vaccines. This review gives an overview of the causes of these issues and what is currently being done to address them.

Establishing the existence of a moral obligation to be vaccinated (both for adults and for children) despite the negligible contribution each vaccination can make to the realisation of herd immunity is important because such moral obligation would strengthen the justification for coercive vaccination policies. We show that two types of arguments-namely a utilitarian argument based on Parfit's Principle of Group Beneficence and a contractualist argument-can ground an individual moral obligation to be vaccinated, in spite of the imperceptible contribution that any single vaccination makes to vaccine coverage rates. We add a further argument for a moral obligation to be vaccinated that does not require embracing problematic comprehensive moral theories such as utilitarianism or contractualism. The argument is based on a \"duty of easy rescue\" applied to collectives, which grounds a collective moral obligation to realise herd immunity, and on a principle of fairness in the distribution of the burdens that must be borne to realise herd immunity."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Delays in vaccination can stymie the development of herd immunity, and a large proportion of children in the U.S. are known not to receive vaccines on time.", "answer_start": 14}], "question": "What is herd immunity?", "id": "5e6e9348c6a8763d23000005_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "INTRODUCTION: Delays in vaccination can stymie the development of herd immunity, and a large proportion of children in the U.S. are known not to receive vaccines on time. This study quantifies delays in vaccination, compares vaccination timeliness to the proportion of children vaccinated, and evaluates the impact of combination vaccine use and timely administration of hepatitis B vaccine birth dose on vaccine timeliness among Michigan children.METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry-the state immunization information system-for children born 2006-2010. Children aged 24 months as of December 31, 2012, were included. The proportion of children with timely administration of vaccine doses was calculated, and the mean days of vaccination delay with SD were reported.RESULTS: Among 620,592 Michigan children, 42.2% had received all vaccines, but only 13.2% were vaccinated on time by age 24 months. Children's vaccinations were delayed an average of 59.2 (SD=91.2) days by age 24 months for all recommended vaccine doses. Children who received a timely hepatitis B vaccine birth dose or who received a combination vaccine had less delay in vaccination.CONCLUSIONS: Michigan children have high vaccination coverage based on standard measures but few receive these vaccines on time.

Following the removal of H1, all solubility differences between chromatin replicated in sodium butyrate for 30 min (bu-chromatin) and control chromatin were lost. Reconstitution with H1 completely restored the preferential Mg(2+)-solubility of bu-chromatin, demonstrating that a reduced capacity for aggregation/condensation is an inherent feature of acetylated nascent nucleosomes; however, titration with excess H1 caused the solubility differences to be lost again. Moreover, when the core histone N-terminal \"tails\" (the sites of acetylation) were removed by trypsinization prior to reconstitution, H1 was unable to reestablish the altered solubility of chromatin replicated in butyrate. Thus, the core histone \"tails,\" and the acetylation thereof, not only modulate H1-mediated nucleosome interactions in vitro, but also strongly influence the ability of H1 to differentiate between new and old nucleosomes.

The primary outcomes were efficacy (the proportion of patients with restored ability to walk independently [functional grade ≤2] at week 4) in the eculizumab group and safety in the full analysis set. For the efficacy endpoint, we predefined a response rate threshold of the lower 90% CI boundary exceeding 50%.

Since the discovery of chromothripsis, a phenomenon whereby multiple DSBs locally generated by a catastrophic event causes genomic rearrangements that feed carcinogenesis, DSB clusters receive increased attention also in the field of cancer. While formation of DSB clusters after exposure to high LET is a direct and inherent consequence of the spatial distribution of the constituting energy deposition events, also called track structure, the sources of local genomic shattering underpinning chromothripsis are under investigation. Notably, many consequences of DSB clusters in the affected genome reflect processing by pathways that have evolved to repair DSBs, but which operate with widely different degrees of fidelity. The molecular underpinnings and the basis of the underlying repair pathway choices that ultimately lead to the observed consequences from DSB clusters remain unknown. We developed a tractable model of DSB clustering that allows direct analysis in cells of the consequences of certain configurations of DSB clusters. We outline the rationale for the development of this model and describe its key characteristics. We summarize results suggesting that DSB clusters compromise the first-line DSB-processing pathways of c-NHEJ and HRR, increasing as a consequence the contribution of alt-EJ, which has high propensity of generating chromosomal rearrangements.

At least part of the problem is technical; it is difficult to detect and quantify interstrand cross-links when the same agent forms both cross-links and single strand breaks because the detection of interstrand cross-links generally involves a denaturation step. Our group has studied the induction of interstrand cross-links following irradiation of DNA containing bromouracil at specific sites. We found that the formation of interstrand cross-links requires the presence of a few (3-5) mismatched bases, comprising the bromouracil. In the absence of mismatched bases, no radiation-induced cross-linking was observed; however, even in the absence of bromouracil, cross-linking still occurred, albeit at a lower efficiency. Our molecular modelling studies demonstrate that the mobility of the bases in the mismatched region is essential for the cross-linking process. Thus, our hypothesis is that ionizing radiation induces DNA interstrand cross-links in non-hybridized regions of DNA. Some obvious examples of such DNA regions are replication forks, transcription bubbles and the D-loop of telomeres. However, an abundance of studies have made it clear that there must be many single-stranded regions in the genome, such as hairpins and cruciforms. For example, alpha satellite DNA, in centromere regions of human chromosomes, forms hairpins. Thus, a variety of non-B DNA structures (hairpins, slipped DNA and tetrahelical structures) exist in the genome and should be susceptible to the formation of radiation-induced interstrand cross-links. Although interstrand cross-links have thus far been virtually ignored in radiation biology, it will be worthwhile to develop methods to detect their presence following exposure of cells to biologically relevant levels of ionizing radiation, since, on a per lesions basis, they are probably more toxic than double-strand breaks."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "While much is known about radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair, ", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Are breaks in double stranded DNA associated with ionizing radiation?", "id": "5e3c6e15b5b409ea53000023_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "While much is known about radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair, the question of how deletions of different sizes arise as a result of the processing of DSBs by the cell's repair systems has not been fully answered. In order to bridge this gap between DSBs and deletions, we critically reviewed published data on mechanisms pertaining to: (a) repair of DNA DSBs (from basic studies in this area); (b) formation of naturally occurring structural variation (SV) - especially of deletions - in the human genome (from genomic studies) and (c) radiation-induced mutations and structural chromosomal aberrations in mammalian somatic cells (from radiation mutagenesis and radiation cytogenetic studies). The specific aim was to assess the relative importance of the postulated mechanisms in generating deletions in the human genome and examine whether empirical data on radiation-induced deletions in mouse germ cells are consistent with predictions of these mechanisms. The mechanisms include (a) NHEJ, a DSB repair process that does not require any homology and which functions in all stages of the cell cycle (and is of particular relevance in G0/G1); (b) MMEJ, also a DSB repair process but which requires microhomology and which presumably functions in all cell cycle stages; (c) NAHR, a recombination-based DSB repair mechanism which operates in prophase I of meiosis in germ cells; (d) MMBIR, a microhomology-mediated, replication-based mechanism which operates in the S phase of the cell cycle, and (e) strand slippage during replication (involved in the origin of small insertions and deletions (INDELs). Our analysis permits the inference that, between them, these five mechanisms can explain nearly all naturally occurring deletions of different sizes identified in the human genome, NAHR and MMBIR being potentially more versatile in this regard. With respect to radiation-induced deletions, the basic studies suggest that those arising as a result of the operation of NHEJ/MMEJ processes, as currently formulated, are expected to be relatively small. However, data on induced mutations in mouse spermatogonial stem cells (irradiation in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and DSB repair presumed to be via NHEJ predominantly) show that most are associated with deletions of different sizes, some in the megabase range. There is thus a 'discrepancy' between what the basic studies suggest and the empirical observations in mutagenesis studies. This discrepancy, however, is only an apparent but not a real one. It can be resolved by considering the issue of deletions in the broader context of and in conjunction with the organization of chromatin in chromosomes and nuclear architecture, the conceptual framework for which already exists in studies carried out during the past fifteen years or so. In this paper, we specifically hypothesize that repair of DSBs induced in chromatin loops may offer a basis to explain the induction of deletions of different sizes and suggest an approach to test the hypothesis. We emphasize that the bridging of the gap between induced DSB and resulting deletions of different sizes is critical for current efforts in computational modeling of genetic risks."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The highly variable phenotypes observed in patients with classic Bartter's syndrome (BS) remain unsatisfactorily explained.

The wide spectrum of functional severity of CLCNKB mutations may contribute to the phenotypic variability, and the genotype-phenotype association has not been established. Low-level expression of the human ClC-Kb channel in mammalian cells impedes the functional study of CLCNKB mutations, and the underlying cause is still unclear. The human ClC-Kb channel is highly degraded by proteasome in human embryonic kidney cells. The C-terminal in-frame green fluorescent protein fusion may slow down the proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Barttin co-expression necessarily improves the stability, membrane trafficking and gating of ClC-Kb. CLCNKB mutations in barttin-binding sites, dimer interface or selectivity filter often have severe functional consequences. The remaining chloride conductance of the ClC-Kb mutant channel significantly correlates with the phenotypes, such as age at diagnosis, plasma chloride concentration, and the degree of calciuria in patients with classic BS.ABSTRACT: Mutations in the CLCNKB gene encoding the human voltage-gated chloride ClC-Kb (hClC-Kb) channel cause classic Bartter's syndrome (BS). In contrast to antenatal BS, classic BS manifests with highly variable phenotypes. The functional severity of the mutant channel has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Due to difficulties in the expression of hClC-Kb in heterologous expression systems, the functional consequences of mutant channels have not been thoroughly examined, and the genotype-phenotype association has not been established. In this study, we found that hClC-Kb, when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, was unstable due to degradation by proteasome. In-frame fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus of the channel may ameliorate proteasome degradation. Co-expression of barttin increased protein abundance and membrane trafficking of hClC-Kb and markedly increased functional chloride current. We then functionally characterized 18 missense mutations identified in our classic BS cohort and others using HEK cells expressing hClC-Kb-GFP. Most CLCNKB mutations resulted in marked reduction in protein abundance and chloride current, especially those residing at barttin binding sites, dimer interface and selectivity filter. We enrolled classic BS patients carrying homozygous missense mutations with well-described functional consequences and clinical presentations for genotype-phenotype analysis. We found significant correlations of mutant chloride current with the age at diagnosis, plasma chloride concentration and urine calcium excretion rate. In conclusion, hClC-Kb expression in HEK cells is susceptible to proteasome degradation, and fusion of GFP to the C-terminus of hClC-Kb improves protein expression. The functional severity of the CLCNKB mutation is an important determinant of the phenotype in classic BS.© 2017 The Authors.

Abdominal sonography revealed bilateral small size kidneys without nephrocalcinosis or renal stones. After the withdrawal of indomethacin with regular KCl and adequate fluid supplementation for 1 year, serum creatinine and K+ levels have been maintained at 4.0 mg/dl and 3.3 mmol/l, respectively.

Long-term therapy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), prolonged hypokalemia, chronic volume depletion, and underlying genetic variety may contribute to the deterioration of his renal function.

Genetic heterogeneity of hyperprostaglandin E syndrome has been demonstrated by identification of mutations in the SLC12A1 gene as well as in the KCNJ1 gene. Mutations in SLC12A1 coding for the bumetanide-sensitive sodium potassium 2 chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) cause defective reabsorption of sodium chloride in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Mutations in KCNJ1 leading to loss of function of the potassium channel ROMK disrupt potassium recycling back to the tubule lumen and inhibit thereby the NKCC2 activity. A third gene for hyperprostaglandin E syndrome has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1, and it remains to be evaluated whether other genes are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Classic Bartter's syndrome has been demonstrated to result from defective chloride transport across the basolateral membrane in the distal nephron due to mutations in the chloride channel gene CLCNKB. This article reviews the molecular genetic approach that has led to identification of genetic defects underlying the different hypokalemic tubulopathies."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "INTERPRETATION: Natalizumab treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis did not reduce progression on the primary multicomponent disability endpoint in part 1, but it did reduce progression on its upper-limb component.", "answer_start": 2879}], "question": "Does natalizumab improve disease course of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis?", "id": "5e48b1ddd14c9f295d000012_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Although several disease-modifying treatments are available for relapsing multiple sclerosis, treatment effects have been more modest in progressive multiple sclerosis and have been observed particularly in actively relapsing subgroups or those with lesion activity on imaging. We sought to assess whether natalizumab slows disease progression in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, independent of relapses.METHODS: ASCEND was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (part 1) with an optional 2 year open-label extension (part 2). Enrolled patients aged 18-58 years were natalizumab-naive and had secondary progressive multiple sclerosis for 2 years or more, disability progression unrelated to relapses in the previous year, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of 3·0-6·5. In part 1, patients from 163 sites in 17 countries were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 300 mg intravenous natalizumab or placebo every 4 weeks for 2 years. Patients were stratified by site and by EDSS score (3·0-5·5 vs 6·0-6·5). Patients completing part 1 could enrol in part 2, in which all patients received natalizumab every 4 weeks until the end of the study. Throughout both parts, patients and staff were masked to the treatment received in part 1. The primary outcome in part 1 was the proportion of patients with sustained disability progression, assessed by one or more of three measures: the EDSS, Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), and 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). The primary outcome in part 2 was the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01416181.FINDINGS: Between Sept 13, 2011, and July 16, 2015, 889 patients were randomly assigned (n=440 to the natalizumab group, n=449 to the placebo group). In part 1, 195 (44%) of 439 natalizumab-treated patients and 214 (48%) of 448 placebo-treated patients had confirmed disability progression (odds ratio [OR] 0·86; 95% CI 0·66-1·13; p=0·287). No treatment effect was observed on the EDSS (OR 1·06, 95% CI 0·74-1·53; nominal p=0·753) or the T25FW (0·98, 0·74-1·30; nominal p=0·914) components of the primary outcome. However, natalizumab treatment reduced 9HPT progression (OR 0·56, 95% CI 0·40-0·80; nominal p=0·001). In part 1, 100 (22%) placebo-treated and 90 (20%) natalizumab-treated patients had serious adverse events. In part 2, 291 natalizumab-continuing patients and 274 natalizumab-naive patients received natalizumab (median follow-up 160 weeks [range 108-221]). Serious adverse events occurred in 39 (13%) patients continuing natalizumab and in 24 (9%) patients initiating natalizumab. Two deaths occurred in part 1, neither of which was considered related to study treatment. No progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurred.INTERPRETATION: Natalizumab treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis did not reduce progression on the primary multicomponent disability endpoint in part 1, but it did reduce progression on its upper-limb component. Longer-term trials are needed to assess whether treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis might produce benefits on additional disability components.FUNDING: Biogen.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this review, we summarize the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of SPMS and the rationale and clinical potential for natalizumab, which is currently approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to exert beneficial effects in reducing disease progression unrelated to relapses in SPMS. In both forms of MS, active brain-tissue injury is associated with inflammation; but in SPMS, the inflammatory response occurs at least partly behind the blood-brain barrier and is followed by a cascade of events, including persistent microglial activation that may lead to chronic demyelination and neurodegeneration associated with irreversible disability. In patients with relapsing forms of MS, natalizumab therapy is known to significantly reduce intrathecal inflammatory responses which results in reductions in brain lesions and brain atrophy as well as beneficial effects on clinical measures, such as reduced frequency and severity of relapse and reduced accumulation of disability. Natalizumab treatment also reduces levels of cerebrospinal fluid chemokines and other biomarkers of intrathecal inflammation, axonal damage and demyelination, and has demonstrated the ability to reduce innate immune activation and intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis in patients with MS.

Here we show that the absence of H3K4 methylation, either achieved by deletion of the SET1 methyltransferase or by amino acid substitution of H3K4, bypasses the requirement of RSC for stress-responsive gene expression. Monomethylation of H3K4 is specifically inhibiting RSC-independent chromatin remodeling and thus, it prevents osmostress-induced gene expression. The absence of H3K4 monomethylation permits that the association of alternative remodelers with stress-responsive genes and the Swr1 complex (SWR-C) is instrumental in the induction of gene expression upon stress. Accordingly, the absence of SWR-C or histone H2A.Z results in compromised chromatin remodeling and impaired gene expression in the absence of RSC and H3K4 methylation.

Solid-state coating morphology of PTH(1-34) on microprojection arrays was determined by SEM, and stability on storage was assessed after dissolution and testing with stability indicating assays. Internal vapor analysis was performed to detect and quantify volatile organics released by patch components into the headspace inside the final package.RESULTS: Aggregation and oxidation were the primary degradation mechanisms for solid-state PTH(1-34) in this transdermal delivery system. Although these two degradation pathways can be retarded by appropriate stabilizers and use of foil pouch packaging (nitrogen purged and desiccant), the solid-state drug formulation's compatibility with patch components, particularly the plastic retainer ring, surprisingly dictated PTH(1-34) stability.

Hence, the role of the RBM is a bi-functional bioactive surface that can be demonstrated by antibodies such as the neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody (mAb) 80R which targets the RBM and competes with the ACE2 receptor for binding. Here, we employ phage-display peptide-libraries to reconstitute a functional RBM. This is achieved by generating a vast collection of candidate RBM peptides that present a diversity of conformations. Screening such 'Conformer Libraries' with corresponding ligands has produced short RBM constructs (ca. 40 amino acids) that can bind both the ACE2 receptor and the neutralizing mAb 80R."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "There was no difference between the multipotent adult progenitor cell group and placebo groups in global stroke recovery at day 90 (odds ratio 1·08 [95% CI 0·55-2·09], p=0·83).INTERPRETATION: Administration of multipotent adult progenitor cells was safe and well tolerated in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

We aimed to identify the highest, well-tolerated, and safest single dose of multipotent adult progenitor cells, and if they were efficacious as a treatment for stroke recovery.METHODS: We did a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial of intravenous multipotent adult progenitor cells in 33 centres in the UK and the USA. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence and interactive voice and web response system to assign patients aged 18-83 years with moderately severe acute ischaemic stroke and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 8-20 to treatment with intravenous multipotent adult progenitor cells (400 million or 1200 million cells) or placebo between 24 h and 48 h after symptom onset. Patients were ineligible if there was a change in NIHSS of four or more points during at least a 6 h period between screening and randomisation, had brainstem or lacunar infarct, a substantial comorbid disease, an inability to undergo an MRI scan, or had a history of splenectomy. In group 1, patients were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive 400 million cells or placebo and assessed for safety through 7 days. In group 2, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive 1200 million cells or placebo and assessed for safety through the first 7 days.

Patients, investigators, and clinicians were masked to treatment assignment. The primary safety outcome was dose-limiting toxicity effects. The primary efficacy endpoint was global stroke recovery, which combines dichotomised results from the modified Rankin scale, change in NIHSS score from baseline, and Barthel index at day 90. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT) including all patients in groups 2 and 3 who received the investigational agent or placebo.

The ITT populations consisted of 65 patients who received multipotent adult progenitor cells and 61 patients who received placebo. There were no dose-limiting toxicity events in either group. There were no infusional or allergic reactions and no difference in treatment-emergent adverse events between the groups (64 [99%] of 65 patients in the multipotent adult progenitor cell group vs 59 [97%] of 61 in the placebo group).

Polymorphism screening of the exons containing previously reported nonsynonymous base substitutions was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method, using genomic DNA from 81 Japanese patients with SLE and 207 healthy individuals. Two alleles were present in exon 6, coding for methionine (196M) and arginine (196R) at position 196. 30 of 81 patients (37.0%) with SLE were positive for the 196R allele, which was significantly more frequent compared with 39 of 207 healthy individuals (18.8%) (chi2=10.6, df=l, P=0.001, odds ratio=2.53, 95% CI: 1.45-4.43).

Although rarely reported, MAS might occur in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), notably as an inaugural manifestation. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the cornerstone of SLE therapy. However, in some cases high doses of GCs are required to achieve remission (i.e. glucocorticoid-resistance), leading to significant side effects.CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old Romani male was admitted to our hospital for polyarthralgia, polyserositis and fatigability. The patient had high-grade fever, jaundice and generalized lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests revealed severe mixed hemolytic autoimmune anemia, leukopenia, hepatocytolysis, coagulation abnormalities, hypertriglyceridemia, biological inflammatory syndrome, hyperferritinemia and persistent proteinuria of nephritic pattern. Imaging studies showed pleuropericardial effusion, hepatosplenomegaly and polysynovitis. Additional blood tests revealed hypocomplementemia and positive ANA, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies. Haemophagocytosis was not identified either on bone marrow or axillary lymph node biopsy specimens. However, SLE-associated MAS seemed to fit this set-up. High-dose corticotherapy (6.5 g methylprednisolone followed by prednisone, 1.5 mg/kg/day after discharge) and intravenous cyclophosphamide were necessary to induce and sustain remission.CONCLUSION: MAS is a potentially severe manifestation that should be considered at SLE onset whenever high fever and elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin and procalcitonin are noted. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment lead to remission in two thirds of cases. Glucocorticoid-resistance leads to the use of high-dose corticotherapy or immunosuppressive agents that could elicit serious side effects.

Several treatments such as steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being investigated in order to decrease the blood cytokine level, which increases remarkably. However, any of these therapeutic treatments are not always reliable and effective; none have drastically improved survival rates, and some have mostly ended with failure. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are signaling molecules responsible for the production of cytokines and chemokines that can mediate hyperactivation of the immune response called cytokine storm. In addition to the above-mentioned agents, various antioxidants have been explored for the removal of excess ROS during inflammation. However, the development of low-molecular-weight (LMW) antioxidants as therapeutic agents has been hampered by several issues associated with toxicity, poor pharmacokinetics, low bioavailability, and rapid metabolism. In the present study, we aimed to overcome these limitations through the use of antioxidative nanoparticles possessing 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) which are covalently conjugated to polymer. Although treatment with antioxidative nanoparticles alone did not eliminate bacteria, combined treatment with an antibacterial agent was found to significantly improve survival rate of the treated mice as compared to the control group. More importantly, the antioxidative nanoparticles reduced oxidative tissue injury caused by the bacterial infection. Thus, our findings highlighted the effectiveness of combination treatment with antioxidative nanoparticles and an antibacterial agent to prevent severe inflammation caused by bacterial infection."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " cytokine storm leading to severe organ damage", "answer_start": 133}], "question": "What is a \"cytokine storm\"?", "id": "5e807578835f4e4777000028_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare life-threatening condition that has a poor prognosis due to the ensuing cytokine storm leading to severe organ damage.

CASE REPORT The authors present a case of a 41-year-old African-American female who presented with symptoms of foodborne illness and who developed multi-organ dysfunction. HLH was suspected because of poor response to broad-spectrum antibiotics with a constellation of findings, including cytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperferritinemia. Clinical improvement was noted after administration of intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone while waiting for the soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels; therefore, chemotherapy was not administered.  CONCLUSIONS Despite the variable and poor prognosis of HLH, early treatment with steroids and immunosuppressive therapy is crucial to improving the survival rate.

Crocin inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide production via downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B activity in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. These effects were abrogated by blocking of HO-1 expression or activity. Crocin also induced Ca(2+) mobilization from intracellular pools and phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 4 (CAMK4). CAMK4 knockdown and kinase-dead mutant inhibited crocin-mediated HO-1 expression, Nrf2 activation, and phosphorylation of Akt, indicating that HO-1 expression is mediated by CAMK4 and that Akt is a downstream mediator of CAMK4 in crocin signaling. Moreover, crocin-mediated suppression of iNOS expression was blocked by CAMK4 inhibition. Overall, these results suggest that crocin suppresses LPS-stimulated expression of iNOS by inducing HO-1 expression via Ca(2+)/calmodulin-CAMK4-PI3K/Akt-Nrf2 signaling cascades.

Patients who received at least one previous line of treatment were enrolled at five academic hospitals in China into the dose-escalation and expansion trial to receive camrelizumab monotherapy intravenously at escalating doses of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, and a bridging dose of 200 mg per dose once every 2 weeks (monotherapy trial). Treatment-naive patients were enrolled from a single centre in China to receive six cycles of camrelizumab 200 mg (day 1), gemcitabine 1 g/m2 (days 1 and 8), and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 (day 1) every 3 weeks followed by camrelizumab 200 mg maintenance once every 3 weeks (combination trial). The primary endpoint of both trials was the safety and tolerability of the study treatment. Analyses were done per protocol. Both trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02721589 (camrelizumab monotherapy trial) and NCT03121716 (camrelizumab combination trial). Both trials are ongoing, but are no longer enrolling patients.FINDINGS: In the camrelizumab monotherapy trial, between March 31, 2016, and Sept 20, 2017, 121 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 93 patients were enrolled across the dose-escalation and expansion cohorts and received at least one dose of camrelizumab (safety population). 15 (16%) of 93 patients had treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4, the most common of which were elevated conjugated bilirubin concentration (three [3%] of 93 patients), stomatitis, anaemia, and increased concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin, each of which occurred in two (2%) patients. Eight (9%) patients had a treatment-related serious adverse event. No dose-limiting toxic effects were observed during the dose-escalation phase. 31 (34%; 95% CI 24-44) of 91 evaluable patients on camrelizumab monotherapy had an overall response with a median follow-up of 9·9 months (IQR 8·1-11·7). In the camrelizumab combination trial, between April 18, 2017, and Aug 15, 2017, 24 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 23 patients were enrolled and treated (safety population). 20 (87%) of 23 patients had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events: neutropenia (13 [57%] of 23 patients), anaemia (11 [48%] patients), leucopenia (11 [48%] patients), thrombocytopenia (seven [30%] patients), oedema (two [9%] patients), hyponatraemia (two [9%] patients), hypochloraemia (one [4%] patients), and rash (one [4%] patient). Two patients had treatment-related serious adverse events. No treatment-related deaths occurred in these trials. 20 (91% [95% CI 72-97]) of 22 evaluable patients had an overall response with a median follow-up time of 10·2 months (IQR 9·7-10·8).INTERPRETATION: Camrelizumab is a well tolerated, potential treatment option for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The combination of camrelizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin has a manageable toxicity profile and promising preliminary antitumour activity for this disease in treatment-naive patients. Randomised controlled trials are needed to further establish the role of immune checkpoint inhibition for nasopharyngeal carcinomas.FUNDING: Hengrui Medicine Co, Chinese National Natural Science Foundation project, Science and Technology Program of Guangdong, Pearl River Nova Program of Guangzhou.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of CD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells.

Stool frequency per 24 h and during daytime was higher following a J pouch than W, S or K constructions. The J design resulted in increased faecal urgency and seepage during daytime compared with the K design. The use of protective pads during daytime and night-time was greater with a J pouch compared to S or K. The use of antidiarrhoeal medication was greater after a J reservoir than a W reservoir.

The emergence of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has been considered to be because of the excessive use of antimalarial drugs worldwide. Moreover, the intense distribution and prevalence of chloroquine-resistant strains in endemic regions has aided the incidence of more complications to malaria treatment and control. Due to the lack of literature that portrays evident molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, it has been difficult to understand the drug resistance conferred by Plasmodium species. Intensive research on CQ drug resistance has identified the association of P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter protein (PfCRT), which belongs to the drug/metabolite transporter and EamA-like superfamily. Additionally, it has shown that K76 T mutation in PfCRT protein has mainly attributed to CQ resistance than other mutations. This study deals with the development of an in silico model of the PfCRT protein and its interaction with the CQ ligand molecule as well as the biochemical and biophysical characterization of the transmembrane domain 1 (TMD 1) peptide of the PfCRT protein. The physiochemical analysis of the PfCRT protein identified basic differences between the wild and mutant forms of the protein, as well as identifying the high hydrophobic nature of the mutant-type protein. The tertiary structure of the PfCRT protein was predicted and interaction with CQ revealed different active pocket binding regions in both the wild and mutant form of PfCRT proteins. The CQ2+ molecule interacts with TMD 10 of the wild-type PfCRT protein, whereas it interacts with TMD 1 of the mutant-type protein. Studies on the TMD 1 peptide revealed the insertion of the peptide in the micelles adopting stable alpha-helical structure. Binding studies with the CQ molecule detected high binding affinity toward the mutant-type TMD 1 peptide rather than the wild-type, thus confirming that the TMD 1 peptide is involved in substrate selectivity. Our findings help to characterize the structure of the PfCRT protein and the role played by the TMD 1 region in CQ resistance using in silico and biochemical approaches. Molecular docking and ligand binding studies confirm that TMD 1 is involved in substrate selectivity and aids in CQ efflux, thereby contributing to the parasite's CQ drug resistance mechanism."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Historically chloroquine was used to treat the most deadly form of malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum.

Antagonizing HMGB1 prolongs muscle necrosis and deters regeneration. In this study, we evaluated HMGB1 expression in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and the mechanisms that promote its release in a murine model of hindlimb ischemia. Specifically, we investigated how chloroquine (CQ), a commonly employed disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, promotes HMGB1 release from muscle. We hypothesized that CQ could increase HMGB1 locally and systemically, allowing it to mediate recovery from ischemic injury.METHODS: Muscle biopsies were performed on patients undergoing lower extremity surgery for non-PAD-related disease as well as for claudication and critical limb ischemia. Clinical symptoms and ankle-brachial indices were recorded for each patient. HMGB1 was detected in muscle sections using immunohistochemical staining. Unilateral femoral artery ligation was performed on both wild-type and inducible HMGB1 knockout mice. Wild-type mice were administered intraperitoneal CQ 2 weeks before and after femoral artery ligation. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging was used to determine perfusion recovery. Serum and tissue levels of HMGB1 were measured at designated time points. In vitro, cultured C2C12 myoblasts were treated with increasing doses of CQ. HMGB1, autophagosome formation, p62/SQSTM1 accumulation, caspase-1 expression and activity, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were measured in supernatants and cell lysates.RESULTS: Nuclear expression of HMGB1 was prominent in patients with claudication and critical limb ischemia (P < .05) compared with controls. CQ-treated mice had elevated serum HMGB1 and diffuse HMGB1 staining in muscle (P < .01). In wild-type mice, CQ treatment resulted in higher laser Doppler perfusion imaging ratios in the ischemic limb at 7 days (P < .03) and less fat replacement after 2 weeks (P < .03). In cultured myoblasts, CQ induced autophagosome accumulation, inhibited p62/SQSTM-1 degradation, and activated caspase-1.CONCLUSIONS: HMGB1 is prominently expressed in PAD muscle but mostly confined to the nucleus. Our in vivo data suggest that HMGB1 mobilization into the sarcoplasm and serum can be increased with CQ, possibly through caspase-1-mediated pathways. Whereas HMGB1 can be released by many cell types, these studies suggest that the muscle may be an important additional source that is relevant in PAD.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

It is also licensed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Studies of HCQ-treated patients with SLE or RA have demonstrated a positive correlation between whole-blood HCQ levels and clinical response. Such studies have involved measuring whole-blood concentrations at any given time point after HCQ ingestion assuming that steady-state concentrations would undergo limited fluctuation over a daily interval because HCQ has a long half-life. This approach might not sufficiently take into account the potential intra-patient variation in HCQ blood levels that can occur over a 24-hour period. Such variation, if significant, could affect the credibility of any concentration-response relationship provided from these previous studies. Objectives The objectives of this report are to: (a) investigate the intra-patient variation in HCQ whole-blood levels and (b) suggest an optimum time for sampling patients for future studies. Methods Six patients were recruited with cutaneous lupus erythematosus who had each been on HCQ 200 mg twice daily for at least six months, so that they were at steady-state. Each patient was fasted overnight and had standardized meals and dosing schedule. Whole blood was sampled at seven time points over 24 hours. Whole-blood HCQ levels were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography using gradient elution, fluorimetric detection and chloroquine as an internal standard. The assay had a mean inter- and intra-day coefficient of variation of 10% and 5% respectively and a limit of detection of 5ng/ml. Results HCQ levels appeared to follow a biphasic pattern over the sampling period. Maximum levels were noted a median of four hours (range 2-6) after ingestion. Median intra-patient variation between trough and peak levels, 'Cmax' ((peak - trough)/trough × 100%), was 27% (range 8-150%). Conclusions This study demonstrated that whole-blood HCQ levels vary 27% (median, range 8-150%) within an individual over a 12-hour period. Drug levels might differ between individuals because of multiple factors, including variable adherence to medication. Measuring HCQ levels for assessment of drug adherence could be valuable in the 'real-world' clinical setting. This could be assessed by taking a blood sample at any time following HCQ ingestion. If patients were found to have very low or undetectable levels of HCQ, non-adherence to HCQ should be suspected."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, which act by inhibiting progression from the G1 to S phases of the cell cycle, include palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib, and trilaciclib.

Confirmation of the disease relies on finding appropriate cytological or histopathological changes in association with positive immunostaining for FCoV antigen. In FIP cases with effusions, cytology and immunostaining on effusion samples can be relatively easy to perform; otherwise obtaining diagnostic samples is more challenging and collection of biopsies from tissues with gross lesions is necessary. In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, a high index of suspicion of FIP may be obtained from the cat's signalment and history, combined with findings on clinical examination and laboratory test results. If largely consistent with FIP, these can be used as a basis for discussion with the owner about whether additional, more invasive, diagnostic tests are warranted.

Putative miRNA-binding sites were identified in the 3'-UTR of the ACE2 transcript using online prediction algorithms. Two of these, miR-200b and miR-421, were selected for further analysis. A reporter system using the 3'-UTR of ACE2 fused to the coding region of firefly luciferase was used to determine the functionality of the identified binding sites in vitro. This identified miR-421, but not miR-200b, as a potential regulator of ACE2. The ability of miR-421, an miRNA implicated in the development of thrombosis, to down-regulate ACE2 expression was subsequently confirmed by Western blot analysis of both primary cardiac myofibroblasts and transformed cells transfected with a synthetic miR-421 precursor. Real-time PCR analysis of miR-421 revealed widespread expression in human tissues. miR-421 levels in cardiac myofibroblasts showed significant inter-patient variability, in keeping with the variability of ACE2 expression we have observed previously.

We assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the GRADE approach. We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures. We reported findings narratively and in tables.MAIN RESULTS: We included nine Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions to treat symptoms in people with MND. Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non-RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. Drug therapy for painThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. Treatment for crampsThere is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo:- memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence);- vitamin E may have little or no effect (low-quality evidence); and- the effects of L-threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data.The review reported adverse effects of riluzole, but it is not clear whether other interventions had adverse effects. Treatment for spasticityIt is uncertain whether an endurance-based exercise programme improved spasticity or quality of life, measured at three months after the programme, as the quality of evidence is very low (1 RCT, comparison \"usual activities\", N = 25). The review did not evaluate other approaches, such as use of baclofen as no RCTs were available. Mechanical ventilation for supporting respiratory functionNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves median survival and quality of life in people with respiratory insufficiency and normal to moderately impaired bulbar function compared to standard care, and improves quality of life but not survival for people with poor bulbar function (1 RCT, N = 41, moderate-quality evidence; a second RCT did not provide data). The review did not evaluate other approaches such as tracheostomy-assisted ('invasive') ventilation, or assess timing of NIV initiation. Treatment for sialorrhoeaA single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands probably improves sialorrhoea and quality of life at up to 4 weeks compared to placebo injections, but not at 8 or 12 weeks after the injections (moderate-quality evidence from 1 placebo-controlled RCT, N = 20). The review authors found no trials of other approaches. Enteral tube feeding for supporting nutritionThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to support benefit or harms of enteral tube feeding in supporting nutrition in MND. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulationIt is uncertain whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves disability or limitation in activity in MND in comparison with sham rTMS (3 RCTs, very low quality evidence, N = 50). Therapeutic exerciseThere is evidence that exercise may improve disability in MND at three months after the exercise programme, but not quality of life, in comparison with \"usual activities\" or \"usual care\" including stretching (2 RCTs, low-quality evidence, N = 43). Multidisciplinary careThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to demonstrate any benefit or harm for multidisciplinary care in MND.None of the reviews, other than the review of treatment for cramps, reported that adverse events occurred. However, the trials were too small for reliable adverse event reporting.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview has highlighted the lack of robust evidence in Cochrane Systematic Reviews on interventions to manage symptoms resulting from MND. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention for reasons other than a true lack of efficacy, for example because of insufficient statistical power, the wrong choice of dose, insensitive outcome measures or inappropriate participant eligibility. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse effects of the treatments. The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a placebo-controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo-controlled RCTs in these areas.We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs-of people with MND and their caregivers-associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality of life)."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L-threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine.

Thus, specific inhibitors of these proteases block virus infection. However, it is unclear which of these pathways is actually utilized by HCoV-229E in the human respiratory tract. Here, we examined the mechanism of cell entry used by a pseudotyped virus bearing the HCoV-229E spike (S) protein in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. We found that, compared with a laboratory strain isolated in 1966 and passaged for a half century, clinical isolates of HCoV-229E were less likely to utilize cathepsin L; rather, they showed a preference for TMPRSS2. Two amino acid substitutions (R642M and N714K) in the S protein of HCoV-229E clinical isolates altered their sensitivity to a cathepsin L inhibitor, suggesting that these amino acids were responsible for cathepsin L use. After 20 passages in HeLa cells, the ability of the isolate to use cathepsin increased so that it was equal to that of the laboratory strain; this increase was caused by an amino acid substitution (I577S) in the S protein. The passaged virus showed a reduced ability to replicate in differentiated airway epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface. These results suggest that the endosomal pathway is disadvantageous for HCoV-229E infection of human airway epithelial cells; therefore, clinical isolates are less able to use cathepsin.IMPORTANCE: Many enveloped viruses enter cells through endocytosis. Viral spike proteins drive the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes to facilitate insertion of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) utilizes endosomal cathepsin L to activate the spike protein after receptor binding. Here, we found that clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferentially utilize the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin L. The endosome is a main site of Toll-like receptor recognition, which then triggers an innate immune response; therefore, HCoV-229E presumably evolved to bypass the endosome by entering the cell via TMPRSS2. Thus, the virus uses a simple mechanism to evade the host innate immune system. Therefore, therapeutic agents for coronavirus-mediated diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), should target cell surface TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Microbiology."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting investigations revealed the presence of cathepsin L in the nuclear compartment in addition to its expected endo-lysosomal localization in colorectal carcinoma cells.", "answer_start": 363}], "question": "Is cathepsin L active in endosomes?", "id": "5e8101e3835f4e477700002e_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Prominent tasks of cysteine cathepsins involve endo-lysosomal proteolysis and turnover of extracellular matrix constituents or plasma membrane proteins for maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.

Fluorescence activated cell sorting analyses with synchronized cell cultures revealed deceleration of cell cycle progression of HCT116 cells upon inhibition of cathepsin L activity, while expression of cathepsin L-enhanced green fluorescent protein chimeras accelerated S-phase entry. We conclude that the activity of cathepsin L is high in the nucleus of colorectal carcinoma cells because of lacking stefin B inhibitory activity.

Ectosomes are formed by outward blebbing from the plasma membrane and are then released by proteolytic cleavage from the cell surface. Apoptotic bodies are generated on apoptotic cell shrinkage and death. Extracellular vesicles are released when the cells are activated or undergo apoptosis under inflammatory conditions.

As on previous occasions, the results obtained in the laboratory are not reproduced in clinical practice. The reasons for this new disappointment in translational medicine are analysed by applying the successes obtained in the experimental animal model for ALS to humans. The most frequently suggested causes for explaining these continuous failures are unawareness of the correct dosage to be used, the ideal duration of the clinical trial in phase III, sample size, the search for a primary outcome for measurement other than survival, the need for biomarkers giving information on the progression of the disease and whether this is modified by the introduction of the drug for study. Debate focuses on whether the transgenic mouse model of ALS which expresses SOD1 mutations which we have been using for more than a decade is an exact reflection of the clinical profile and the physiopathogenic mechanisms present in patients with spo- radic ALS. There is the possibility that depending on the dose administered, minocycline can be a neuroprotector or a neurotoxin. In other words, at a dose of 200 mg/day, this drug behaves like <<Dr. Jekyll>> and like <<Mr. Hyde>> at doses of 400 mg. For the authors of the trial, this possibility does not seem to be the cause of the disappointing results obtained. However, they acknowledge that one of the limitations of their study was that it was impossible to compare the effects of minocycline in the patient after receiving 200 or 400 mg.

It is used to protect the beehive against bacteria and other infections. Therefore a literature survey was done to understand the therapeutic potential of this compound.

This search was further narrowed down to synthesis, bioavailability, CAPE derivatives, radioprotective and radiosensitizing effects of CAPE.RESULTS: This review focused on the differential radiomodulatory effects of CAPE in normal and cancer cells. Besides chemistry and bioavailability, it's potential as a therapeutic agent against radiation induced damage was also evaluated.CONCLUSION: CAPE was found to act both as radioprotector and radiosensitizer.

Melanized CN cells were relatively resistant to mid and max-dose levels of alpha particles and deuterons irradiation. Following irradiation the capsule was stripped, but the cell wall was intact and structural integrity was maintained. At the maximum dose, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and mitochondrial swelling started to occur. In contrast, the non-melanized CN strain was sensitive to the mid-dose radiation. Non-melanized cells presented two morphologies: small condensed, and swollen, lacking structural integrity.

Despite its beneficial therapeutic effects on tumor cells, exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) is associated with several side effects. Although improvements in radiotherapy techniques and instruments could reduce these side effects, there are still important concerns for cancer patients. For several years, scientists have been trying to modulate tumor and normal tissue responses to IR, leading to an increase in therapeutic ratio. So far, several types of radioprotectors and radiosensitizers have been investigated in experimental studies. However, high toxicity of chemical sensitizers or possible tumor protection by radioprotectors creates a doubt for their clinical applications. On the other hand, the protective effects of these radioprotectors or sensitizer effects of radiosensitizers may limit some type of cancers. Hence, the development of some radioprotectors without any protective effect on tumor cells or low toxic radiosensitizers can help improve therapeutic ratio with less side effects. Melatonin as a natural body hormone is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that shows some anti-cancer properties. It is able to neutralize different types of free radicals produced by IR or pro-oxidant enzymes which are activated following exposure to IR and plays a key role in the protection of normal tissues. In addition, melatonin has shown the ability to inhibit long-term changes in inflammatory responses at different levels, thereby ameliorating late side effects of radiotherapy. Fortunately, in contrast to classic antioxidants, some in vitro studies have revealed that melatonin has a potent anti-tumor activity when used alongside irradiation. However, the mechanisms of its radiosensitive effect remain to be elucidated. Studies suggested that the activation of pro-apoptosis gene, such as p53, changes in the metabolism of tumor cells, suppression of DNA repair responses as well as changes in biosynthesis of estrogen in breast cancer cells are involved in this process. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanisms for radioprotection and radiosensitizer effects of melatonin.

However, radiation-induced damage to normal tissues restricts the therapeutic doses of radiation that can be delivered to tumours and thereby limits the effectiveness of the treatment. The use of radioprotectors represents an obvious strategy to obtain better tumour control using a higher dose in radiotherapy. However, most of the synthetic radioprotective compounds studied have shown inadequate clinical efficacy owing to their inherent toxicity and high cost. Hence, the development of radioprotective agents with lower toxicity and an extended window of protection has attracted a great deal of attention, and the identification of alternative agents that are less toxic and highly effective is an absolute necessity. Recent studies have shown that alpha-2-macroglobulin (α2M) possesses radioprotective effects. α2M is a tetrameric, disulfide-rich plasma glycoprotein that functions as a non-selective inhibitor of different types of non-specific proteases and as a carrier of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. α2M induces protein factors whose interplay underlies radioprotection, which supports the idea that α2M is the central effector of natural radioprotection in the rat. Pretreatment with α2M has also induced a significant reduction of irradiation-induced DNA damage and the complete restoration of liver and body weight. Mihailović et al. concluded that the radioprotection provided by α2M was in part mediated through cytoprotection of new blood cells produced in the bone marrow; these authors also indicated that an important aspect of the radioprotective effect of amifostine was the result of the induction of the endogenous cytoprotective capability of α2M. The radioprotective effects of α2M are possibly due to antioxidant, anti-fibrosis, and anti-inflammatory functions, as well as the maintenance of homeostasis, and enhancement of the DNA repair and cell recovery processes. This review is the first to summarise the observations and elucidate the possible mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of α2M.

Human samples were collected at the University of Utah between June 2014 and July 2015.EXPOSURES: Ionizing radiation and doxorubicin.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cancer mortality across species was calculated and compared by body size and life span. The elephant genome was investigated for alterations in cancer-related genes. DNA repair and apoptosis were compared in elephant vs human peripheral blood lymphocytes.RESULTS: Across mammals, cancer mortality did not increase with body size and/or maximum life span (eg, for rock hyrax, 1% [95% CI, 0%-5%]; African wild dog, 8% [95% CI, 0%-16%]; lion, 2% [95% CI, 0%-7%]). Despite their large body size and long life span, elephants remain cancer resistant, with an estimated cancer mortality of 4.81% (95% CI, 3.14%-6.49%), compared with humans, who have 11% to 25% cancer mortality. While humans have 1 copy (2 alleles) of TP53, African elephants have at least 20 copies (40 alleles), including 19 retrogenes (38 alleles) with evidence of transcriptional activity measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In response to DNA damage, elephant lymphocytes underwent p53-mediated apoptosis at higher rates than human lymphocytes proportional to TP53 status (ionizing radiation exposure: patients with LFS, 2.71% [95% CI, 1.93%-3.48%] vs human controls, 7.17% [95% CI, 5.91%-8.44%] vs elephants, 14.64% [95% CI, 10.91%-18.37%]; P < .001; doxorubicin exposure: human controls, 8.10% [95% CI, 6.55%-9.66%] vs elephants, 24.77% [95% CI, 23.0%-26.53%]; P < .001).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with other mammalian species, elephants appeared to have a lower-than-expected rate of cancer, potentially related to multiple copies of TP53. Compared with human cells, elephant cells demonstrated increased apoptotic response following DNA damage. These findings, if replicated, could represent an evolutionary-based approach for understanding mechanisms related to cancer suppression."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, for which mainstream treatments have not changed for decades.

This study demonstrates, as proof of concept, that 3'AmNic-rEPA elicits Abs to nicotine and is associated with higher continuous abstinence rates (CAR).

Current smoking cessation rates using behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapeutic interventions have had modest success, with ∼1:5 smokers remaining abstinent long-term. Nicotine vaccines are a new class of immunotherapeutics under development. It is believed that anti-nicotine antibodies arising from vaccination capture nicotine and prevent or reduce its entry into the brain, as the antibody-bound nicotine is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier. This in turn decreases the pleasurable effects of smoking, reducing or eliminating positive reinforcement, thereby making it easier for a smoker to quit smoking. Four vaccine candidates have advanced into clinical testing with mixed success. Proof-of-concept has been established in that individuals with higher levels of anti-nicotine antibodies were observed to have higher smoking cessation and abstinence rates. Recently, the most advanced candidate vaccine, NicVAX, failed to meet the primary endpoint in two large phase III studies, although the correlation of higher abstinence rates in subjects with higher immunity to nicotine was observed. Although the field has had setbacks, the magnitude of the tobacco epidemic and the positive pre-clinical research and observed clinical trends indicate continued research is warranted. Several avenues are being actively pursued: a) improving vaccine potency by introducing novel carriers and/or adjuvants to stimulate higher immune response b) targeting subjects who have a robust response (e.g. personalized medicine) c) combining vaccines with pharmacotherapy for maintenance of abstinence/relapse prevention.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00318383 NCT00598325 NCT00836199."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Recently, Deep Learning has had an impact in many research areas by achieving new state-of-the-art model performance.

Signalling through IGF1R and IR in the NSCLC cell lines A549 and Hcc193 was stimulated by a combination of IGF1, IGF2 and insulin. It was inhibited by antibodies that block ligand binding, αIR3 (IGF1R) and IR47-9 (IR), and by the ATP-competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors AZ12253801 and NVPAWD742 which inhibit both IGF1R and IR tyrosine kinases. The effect of inhibitors was determined by an anchorage-independent proliferation assay and by analysis of Akt phosphorylation. In Hcc193 cells the reduction in cell proliferation and Akt phosphorylation due to anti-IGF1R antibody was enhanced by antibody-mediated inhibition of the IR whereas in A549 cells, with a relatively low IR:IGF1R expression ratio, it was not. In each cell line proliferation and Akt phosphorylation were more effectively inhibited by AZ12253801 and NVPAWD742 than by combined αIR3 and IR47-9. When the IGF1R alone is inhibited, unencumbered signalling through the IR can contribute to continued NSCLC cell proliferation.
