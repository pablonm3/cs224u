This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate the clinical utility, validity and reliability of the outcome measures and tools used to quantify lower limb changes within studies that included children with ITW.METHODS: The following databases were searched from inception until March 2018: Ovid MEDLINE, EBESCO, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PubMed. Inclusion criteria were studies including children with ITW diagnosis, reporting use of measurement tools or methods describing lower limb characteristics, published in peer-reviewed journals, and in English. The relevant psychometric properties of measurement tools were extracted, and assessed for reported reliability and validity. Included articles were assessed for risk of bias using McMaster quality assessment tool. Results were descriptively synthesized and logistic regression used to determine associations between common assessments.RESULTS: From 3164 retrieved studies, 37 full texts were screened and 27 full texts included. There were 27 different measurement tools described across joint range of motion measurement, gait analysis, electromyography, accelerometer, strength, neurological or radiology assessment. Interventional studies were more likely to report range of motion and gait analysis outcomes, than observational studies. Alvarez classification tool in conjunction with Vicon motion system appeared the contemporary choice for describing ITW gait. There was no significant association between the use of range of motion and gait analysis outcomes and any other outcome tool or assessment in all studies (p > 0.05).There was limited reliability and validity reporting for many outcome measures.SIGNIFICANCE: This review highlighted that a consensus statement should be considered to guide clinicians and researchers in the choice of the most important outcome measures for this population. Having a standard set of measures will enable future treatment trials to collect similar measures thus allowing future systematic reviews to compare results.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The diagnosis is clinical, making it necessary to rule out other neurological and orthopaedic conditions. A relationship between ITW and vestibular dysfunction and/or proprioceptive sensibility has been proposed. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders (autism, language and cognitive disorders) often have ITW.OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of ITW in children with attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity (ADHD).PATIENTS AND METHOD: A study was conducted on children diagnosed with ADHD, with normal neurological examination, with no alterations in MRI scan, cognitive disorder or autism. A complete clinical anamnesis was performed and Achilles shortening was measured with a goniometer.RESULTS: The study included 312 children with a mean age of 11 years (73.7% boys). The ADHD combined subtype was the most frequent (53.8%), followed by the inattentive (44.9%), and hyperactive (1.3%). ITW was observed in 20.8% of patients, particularly in the combined subtype (P=.054). Only 32 of them (49.2%) had Achilles shortening. ITW was associated with sociability disorders (P=.01), absence of pain in legs (P=.022), and family history of ITW (P=.004). Only 11% had previously visited a doctor for this reason.CONCLUSIONS: As in other neurodevelopmental disorders, children with ADHD have frequently more ITW and Achilles shortening than controls, especially if they presented with a social communication disorder or a family history of ITW. An early diagnosis is essential to establish effective treatments.Copyright © 2016 Asociación Española de Pediatría. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.

The cause of idiopathic toe walking is unknown, which hinders the development of treatment strategies. To test whether children with idiopathic toe walking have functional alterations in their spinal motor circuits, we studied the properties of the soleus H-reflex and its modulation with vibration in 26 idiopathic toe walkers and 16 typically developing children. At the group level, the H-reflex properties did not differ, but at the individual level, in 7 of 25 idiopathic toe walkers, some of the H-reflex parameters fell out of normal limits of typically developing children. However, the H-reflex was suppressed by vibration to the Achilles tendon similarly in both the idiopathic toe walkers and typically developing children.

This condition often causes parental concern, with repeated medical contacts and a range of interventions including stretching, casts, injection of botulinum toxin A, and surgical procedures. The purpose of this cohort study was to document the natural history of this condition.METHODS: In a population-based cohort of 1,401 healthy 5.5-year-old Swedish children, we found the prevalence of idiopathic toe-walking to be approximately 5% (63 of 1,401). Of the 63 children who had ever been a toe-walker, 26 still were at the age of 5.5 years and were followed in the current study at 8 and 10 years of age. At the 8-year follow-up, parents were asked by telephone whether their child had received any treatment or diagnosis since the 5.5-year assessment, as well as to what extent (approximately 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the time) the child still walked on the toes. At the visit when the children were 10 years of age, their parents were asked the same questions. All 26 children also underwent a neurological examination and an orthopaedic examination focusing on the lower extremities.RESULTS: At 8 years of age, 6 of 26 children had ceased toe-walking, and by the age of 10 years, 50 (79%) of the original 63 patients had spontaneously ceased toe-walking. Idiopathic toe-walking did not result in contractures of the triceps surae. One subgroup of children displayed early contracture of the ankle and should thus not be considered idiopathic toe-walkers. Four of the children who still toe-walked at the age of 10 years demonstrated some neurodevelopmental comorbidity.CONCLUSIONS: By the age of 10 years, 79% of the children who have ever been a toe-walker spontaneously develop a typical gait, without intervention or contractures of the ankle dorsiflexion. The diagnosis of short tendo Achilles should be retained as a separate diagnosis as there is a subset of children with this entity who should be treated early in childhood. Neurodevelopmental comorbidities are common among those who continue to toe-walk.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level I.

Treatment for toe walking includes physical therapy, orthotics, casting, Botulinum Toxin A injection into gastrocnemius/soleus muscles, and/or surgery; yet, little evidence exists regarding long-term treatment effects.RESEARCH QUESTION: The objective of this study was to explore the differences in longer-term gait outcomes and severity of idiopathic toe walking between children treated actively with casting or inactively following recommendations for stretching.METHODS: Forty-three adolescents and young adults (14.3-28.8 years; 21 females, 22 males) who had participated in an idiopathic toe walking classification study as children, returned for repeat physical examination and three-dimensional computerized gait analysis (13.4 years follow-up, range 9.4-17.8 years); 23 participants had received active treatment with casting and ankle foot orthotics ± Botulinum Toxin A injection as children and 20 participants had received inactive treatment with recommended stretching exercises. Gait analysis data were compared retrospectively from baseline to follow-up using analysis of variance; toe walking severity was compared using a Wilcoxin Signed-Rank Sums test.RESULTS: Ankle angle at initial contact, peak dorsiflexion in stance, and toe walking severity improved significantly in the active treatment group only at follow-up. Significant improvement in peak ankle power and timing of ankle kinematics and kinetics in the gait cycle were found in both groups; however, greater changes occurred in the active treatment group. Both groups showed significantly improved internal plantar flexor moments, whereas knee extension increased in stance and passive ankle dorsiflexion decreased in both groups at follow-up (p = 0.001). Intermittent toe walking was reported in 49% (21/43) of participants at follow-up.SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study suggest that improvement in ankle kinematic timing and ankle kinetic gait analysis variables is sustainable, independent of conservative treatment for idiopathic toe walking in childhood.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Subsequently, 849 of these study participants were given a fourth dose of DTaP(5) and Hib vaccines or a fourth dose of DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib at 1 to 16 months of age. Safety was monitored throughout the study, and blood specimens were obtained to assess antibody responses.RESULTS: DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib elicited similar or fewer solicited injection-site and systemic reactions as compared with the separate administration of US-licensed DTaP(5), IPV, and Hib vaccines. Seroresponse and seroprotection rates elicited by DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib were noninferior to US-licensed equivalent vaccines after the infant series and after the fourth dose. Children immunized with DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib had higher antibody geometric mean concentrations to pertussis toxoid and filamentous hemagglutinin; children immunized with the separate vaccines had higher responses to pertactin. Hib antibody responses to Hib polysaccharide were nearly identical in the DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib and separate-vaccine groups. Persistence of antibodies to the fifth (preschool) dose was also similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib combination vaccine was shown to be immunogenic and well tolerated. No clinically important differences in the safety or immunologic profiles were noted for DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib versus the separately administered, US-licensed equivalent vaccines. DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib is a suitable replacement for separately administered DTaP, IPV, and Hib vaccines.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00662870."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Endotoxins and exotoxins are among the most potent bacterial inducers of cytokines.

However, an overzealous production, leading up to a cytokine storm, can be deleterious and contributes to mortality consecutive to sepsis or toxic shock syndrome. Endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) are particularly inflammatory because they generate auto-amplificatory loops after activation of monocytes/macrophages. LPS and numerous pore-forming exotoxins also activate the inflammasome, the molecular platform that allows the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Among exotoxins, some behave as superantigens, and as such activate the release of cytokines by T-lymphocytes. In most cases, pre-exposure to exotoxins enhances the cytokine production induced by LPS and its lethality, whereas pre-exposure to endotoxin usually results in tolerance.

We add a further argument for a moral obligation to be vaccinated that does not require embracing problematic comprehensive moral theories such as utilitarianism or contractualism.

We found that although the levels of total 3R tau were unchanged, CBL reduced the levels of hyper-phosphorylated tau in both groups of mice.

Histologically, CTE is defined as a tauopathy with a distribution of tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that is distinct from other tauopathies, and usually shows an absence of beta-amyloid deposits, in contrast to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the connection between repeated concussions and CTE-type neurodegeneration has been recently proposed, this causal relationship has not yet been firmly established. Also, the prevalence of CTE among athletes with multiple concussions is unknown.METHODS: We performed a consecutive case series brain autopsy study on six retired professional football players from the Canadian Football League (CFL) with histories of multiple concussions and significant neurological decline.RESULTS: All participants had progressive neurocognitive decline prior to death; however, only 3 cases had post-mortem neuropathological findings consistent with CTE. The other 3 participants had pathological diagnoses of AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the CTE cases showed co-morbid pathology of cancer, vascular disease, and AD.DISCUSSION: Our case studies highlight that not all athletes with history of repeated concussions and neurological symptomology present neuropathological changes of CTE. These preliminary findings support the need for further research into the link between concussion and CTE as well as the need to expand the research to other possible causes of taupathy in athletes.

Although rarely reported, MAS might occur in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), notably as an inaugural manifestation. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the cornerstone of SLE therapy. However, in some cases high doses of GCs are required to achieve remission (i.e. glucocorticoid-resistance), leading to significant side effects.CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old Romani male was admitted to our hospital for polyarthralgia, polyserositis and fatigability. The patient had high-grade fever, jaundice and generalized lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests revealed severe mixed hemolytic autoimmune anemia, leukopenia, hepatocytolysis, coagulation abnormalities, hypertriglyceridemia, biological inflammatory syndrome, hyperferritinemia and persistent proteinuria of nephritic pattern. Imaging studies showed pleuropericardial effusion, hepatosplenomegaly and polysynovitis. Additional blood tests revealed hypocomplementemia and positive ANA, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies. Haemophagocytosis was not identified either on bone marrow or axillary lymph node biopsy specimens. However, SLE-associated MAS seemed to fit this set-up. High-dose corticotherapy (6.5 g methylprednisolone followed by prednisone, 1.5 mg/kg/day after discharge) and intravenous cyclophosphamide were necessary to induce and sustain remission.CONCLUSION: MAS is a potentially severe manifestation that should be considered at SLE onset whenever high fever and elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin and procalcitonin are noted. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment lead to remission in two thirds of cases. Glucocorticoid-resistance leads to the use of high-dose corticotherapy or immunosuppressive agents that could elicit serious side effects.

During infectious processes, the production of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), gamma interferon (IFNγ) and chemokines orchestrates the anti-infectious innate immune response. However, an overzealous production, leading up to a cytokine storm, can be deleterious and contributes to mortality consecutive to sepsis or toxic shock syndrome. Endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) are particularly inflammatory because they generate auto-amplificatory loops after activation of monocytes/macrophages. LPS and numerous pore-forming exotoxins also activate the inflammasome, the molecular platform that allows the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Among exotoxins, some behave as superantigens, and as such activate the release of cytokines by T-lymphocytes. In most cases, pre-exposure to exotoxins enhances the cytokine production induced by LPS and its lethality, whereas pre-exposure to endotoxin usually results in tolerance. In this review we recall the various steps, which, from the very early discovery of pyrogenicity induced by bacterial products, ended to the discovery of the endogenous pyrogen.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are signaling molecules responsible for the production of cytokines and chemokines that can mediate hyperactivation of the immune response called cytokine storm. In addition to the above-mentioned agents, various antioxidants have been explored for the removal of excess ROS during inflammation. However, the development of low-molecular-weight (LMW) antioxidants as therapeutic agents has been hampered by several issues associated with toxicity, poor pharmacokinetics, low bioavailability, and rapid metabolism. In the present study, we aimed to overcome these limitations through the use of antioxidative nanoparticles possessing 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) which are covalently conjugated to polymer. Although treatment with antioxidative nanoparticles alone did not eliminate bacteria, combined treatment with an antibacterial agent was found to significantly improve survival rate of the treated mice as compared to the control group.

Demographic data (age, sex, color, American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] status, previous surgery, and body mass index) and surgical outcomes (length of stay, early and late morbidity, reoperation, and mortality rates) were compared among 63 patients undergoing IPAA.RESULTS: Demographic features were similar among patients (25 open and 38 LAP). Conversely, colorectal cancer at diagnosis prevailed in the open group (60% versus 31.6%; P = .02). Tumor stages (P = .65) and previous surgery index (20% versus 10.5%; P = .46) were similar. Surgical length was longer for LAP (374 versus 281 minutes, P = .003). Short-term complication rates (28% versus 28.9%), hospital stay (10.9 versus 8.9 days), and total long-term reoperations (28% versus 21%) were not statistically different. However, major late morbidity (16% versus 2.6%; P < .001) and late reoperation rates (16% versus 5.2%; P < .05) were greater among open patients. Both groups did not differ regarding pouch failure rates (8% versus 5.2%). There was no operative mortality in the present series.CONCLUSIONS: (1) LAP IPAA is a safe procedure associated with a low conversion rate, (2) short-term results showed no clear advantages for both approaches, and (3) a greater risk of major late complications and late reoperations should be expected after open procedures."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "A random effects meta-analytical model was used to compare adverse events and functional outcome.RESULTS: Thirty comparative studies comparing J, W, S and K pouch designs were included", "answer_start": 226}], "question": "What is a J pouch?", "id": "5e3daf7648dab47f26000005_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "AIM: There is no consensus as to which ileoanal pouch design provides better outcomes after restorative proctocolectomy.

No significant differences were identified between the different pouch designs with regard to anastomotic dehiscence, anastomotic stricture, pelvic sepsis, wound infection, pouch fistula, pouch ischaemia, perioperative haemorrhage, small bowel obstruction, pouchitis and sexual dysfunction. The W and K designs resulted in fewer cases of pouch failure compared with the J and S designs. J pouch construction resulted in a smaller maximum pouch volume compared with W and K pouches. Stool frequency per 24 h and during daytime was higher following a J pouch than W, S or K constructions. The J design resulted in increased faecal urgency and seepage during daytime compared with the K design. The use of protective pads during daytime and night-time was greater with a J pouch compared to S or K. The use of antidiarrhoeal medication was greater after a J reservoir than a W reservoir. Difficulty in pouch evacuation requiring intubation was higher with an S pouch than with W or J pouches.CONCLUSION: Despite its ease of construction and comparable complication rates, the J pouch is associated with higher pouch failure rates and worse function.

Ectosomes are formed by outward blebbing from the plasma membrane and are then released by proteolytic cleavage from the cell surface. Apoptotic bodies are generated on apoptotic cell shrinkage and death. Extracellular vesicles are released when the cells are activated or undergo apoptosis under inflammatory conditions. The number and types of released EVs are different according to the pathophysiological status of the disease. Therefore, EVs can be novel biomarkers for various lung diseases. EVs contain several molecules, including proteins, mRNA, microRNA, and DNA; they transfer these molecules to distant recipient cells. Circulating EVs modify the targeted cells and influence the microenvironment of the lungs. For this unique capability, EVs are expected to be a new drug delivery system and a novel therapeutic target."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " In treated cells, the apoptotic hallmarks such as formation of apoptotic bodies, ", "answer_start": 445}], "question": "What are apoptotic bodies?", "id": "5e81cb50835f4e477700002f_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "A novel guaiane sesquiterpene derivative, guai-2-en-10α-ol, from Ulva fasciata Delile exhibits antimicrobial property. U. fasciata extract was reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against cancer. In the present study, we have studied the anticancer potential of the compound, guai-2-en-10α-ol, from U. fasciata. The compound showed selective cytotoxicity toward triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line (MDA MB-231) in a dose-dependent manner. In treated cells, the apoptotic hallmarks such as formation of apoptotic bodies, cell shrinkage, and nuclear condensation were observed. Many small molecules affect the function of cellular signaling pathways. As EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway proteins are frequently altered in TNBC, we have studied the gene expression of key proteins of this pathway. The semiquantitative PCR results demonstrated the down-regulated expression of PDPK1 (positive regulator) and Akt (key activator) as well as up-regulated expression of PTEN (negative regulator), which suggested the interaction of guai-2-en-10α-ol with upstream protein. Further investigation showed the down-regulation of both PI3K and EGFR. As EGFR is the most upstream protein of the pathway, its protein level expression was investigated. Western blotting analysis confirmed the down-regulation of p-EGFR expression and activation of apoptosis upon compound treatment. Cell cycle analysis also evidenced the G1 phase arrest, which can be due to the inhibition of cell survival pathway. Computational studies showed the interaction of guai-2-en-10α-ol with Asp855 residue of EGFR kinase domain in active conformation. All these results demonstrate the anticancer potential of guai-2-en-10α-ol through EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Extracellular vesicles are cell-derived membrane particles ranging from 30 to 5,000 nm in size, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies.

Their release may also maintain cellular integrity by ridding the cell of damaging substances. This review describes the biogenesis, uptake, and detection of extracellular vesicles in addition to the impact that they have on recipient cells, focusing on mechanisms important in the pathophysiology of kidney diseases, such as thrombosis, angiogenesis, tissue regeneration, immune modulation, and inflammation. In kidney diseases, extracellular vesicles may be utilized as biomarkers, as they are detected in both blood and urine. Furthermore, they may contribute to the pathophysiology of renal disease while also having beneficial effects associated with tissue repair. Because of their role in the promotion of thrombosis, inflammation, and immune-mediated disease, they could be the target of drug therapy, whereas their favorable effects could be utilized therapeutically in acute and chronic kidney injury."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In vitro, the three known yeast nucleosome spacing enzymes (CHD1, ISW1 and ISW2) form arrays with different spacing.", "answer_start": 294}], "question": "What is the function of the ISW1 and CHD1 remodellers in yeast chromatin?", "id": "5d3880eea1e1595105000014_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling machines play a central role in gene regulation by manipulating chromatin structure.
