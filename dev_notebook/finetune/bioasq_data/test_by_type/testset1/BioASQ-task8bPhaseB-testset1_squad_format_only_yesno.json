Gene-expression results obtained from CD4+ T cells (SLE mice) and CD3+ T cells (human SLE patients) were measured by DNA microarray and qRT-PCR. TOFA treatment resulted in reduced levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies, decreased proteinuria, and amelioration of nephritis as compared with those observed in control animals. Moreover, we observed the rebalance in the populations of naïve CD4+ T cells and effector/memory cells in TOFA-treated mice; however, treatment with a combination of TOFA and dexamethasone (DEXA) elicited a stronger inhibitory effect toward the effector/memory cells than did TOFA or DEXA monotherapy.

In this review, I describe the rationale behind current PARP combination clinical trials with chemotherapies, angiogenesis inhibitors, cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors, and inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AK thymoma/mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway.RECENT FINDINGS: PARP inhibitors have primarily been studied as monotherapy in cancers with homologous recombination repair defects based on an early understanding of PARP-1 as a base excision repair enzyme and the idea that abrogation of two DNA repair pathways cripples rapidly dividing cancer cells. It is now known that PARP-1 is a DNA damage sensor with much wider reaching roles in DNA repair processes and normal cellular functions, opening possibilities for PARP inhibitor use in other clinical contexts.SUMMARY: PARP inhibitor combination clinical trials are in the early stages, but will deepen our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms, cancer biology, and targeted therapies, thus contributing to the next iteration of therapeutic options for our patients."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "PURPOSE: Niraparib is a highly selective inhibitor of PARP-1 and PARP-2 approved in the United States for maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Is Niraparib effective for ovarian cancer?", "id": "5e2906948b3851296d00000a_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "PURPOSE: Niraparib is a highly selective inhibitor of PARP-1 and PARP-2 approved in the United States for maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.

After a 7-day PK assessment, all patients received a second 300-mg dose of niraparib under the opposite condition, followed by 7-day PK assessment. Blood samples for PK analyses were collected at baseline (on days 1 and 8) and up to 168 h post-dose. Bioequivalence between conditions was defined by the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to last measurable concentration (AUC0-last) and from 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞) being within the 80-125% range.RESULTS: The high-fat meal/fasting ratios of geometric least-squares means for AUC0-last and AUC0-∞ were 106.8 (90% CI 97.8-116.6) and 110.1 (90% CI 99.7-121.6), respectively, indicating bioequivalence between conditions. Mean half-life, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and time to Cmax after the high-fat meal were similar to, 27% smaller than, and 128% greater than after fasting, respectively.

It is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In particular, PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is activated upon sensing nicked DNA. Once activated, PARP1 is responsible for the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage response mechanisms. This observation provided the rationale for developing PARP1 inhibitors for the treatment of human malignancies. Indeed, three PARP1 inhibitors (Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib) have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Moreover, in 2017, both Olaparib and Niraparib have also been approved for the treatment of fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Despite this very exciting progress in the clinic, the basic signaling mechanism that connects PARP1 to a diverse array of biological processes is still poorly understood. This is, in large part, due to the inherent technical difficulty associated with the analysis of protein PARylation, which is a low-abundance, labile, and heterogeneous PTM. The study of PARylation has been greatly facilitated by the recent advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies tailored to the analysis of this modification.

Studies have shown that early planning of discharge is essential in reducing length of stay and achieving financial benefit; tools that can help predict discharge disposition would therefore be of use. The Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool (RAPT) is a preoperative survey constructed to predict discharge disposition after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The RAPT was developed and tested on a population of Australian patients undergoing joint replacement, but its validity in other populations is unknown. A low RAPT score is reported to indicate a high risk of needing any form of inpatient rehabilitation after TJA, including short-term nursing facilities.QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: This study attempts (1) to assess predictive accuracy of the RAPT on US patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA); and (2) to determine predictive accuracy of each individual score (1-12).METHODS: Between June 2006 and December 2011, RAPT scores of 3213 patients (1449 THAs; 1764 TKAs) were prospectively captured during the preoperative clinical visit. Scores were stored along with other clinical data, including discharge disposition, in a dedicated database on a secure server. The database was queried by the nursing case manager to retrieve the RAPT scores of all patients captured during this time period. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the scores and determine predictive accuracy.RESULTS: Overall predictive accuracy was 78%. RAPT scores<6 and >10 (of 12) predicted with >90% accuracy discharge to inpatient rehabilitation and home, respectively. Predictive accuracy was lowest for scores between 7 and 10 at 65.2% and almost 50% of patients received scores in this range.

Here, we show that a shift in the gut bacterial composition and structure by sterilizing irradiation, characterized by a decrease in the major gut microbiota community Enterobacteriaceae, an expansion of the minor members (e.g., Bacillaceae) and a higher richness and diversity, is tightly linked to radiation-induced ecological fitness (male mating competitiveness, flight capacity, survival rate and life span) decline in Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) sterile males.

A higher nutrient consumption of the flourishing minor gut microbiota may cause a decline in nutrients and energy metabolic activity of host and then result in the reduced ecological fitness of irradiated flies.

The four sessions at this meeting were focused on: (1) molecular and immune advances; (2) combination therapies; (3) news in immunotherapy; and 4) tumor microenvironment and biomarkers. Recent advances in tumor biology and immunology has led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic agents that prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of cancer patients. Immunotherapies in particular have emerged as highly successful approaches to treat patients with cancer including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and Hodgkin's disease. Specifically, many clinical successes have been using checkpoint receptor blockade, including T cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. Despite demonstrated successes, responses to immunotherapy interventions occur only in a minority of patients. Attempts are being made to improve responses to immunotherapy by developing biomarkers. Optimizing biomarkers for immunotherapy could help properly select patients for treatment and help to monitor response, progression and resistance that are critical challenges for the immuno-oncology (IO) field. Importantly, biomarkers could help to design rational combination therapies. In addition, biomarkers may help to define mechanism of action of different agents, dose selection and to sequence drug combinations. However, biomarkers and assays development to guide cancer immunotherapy is highly challenging for several reasons: (i) multiplicity of immunotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action including immunotherapies that target activating and inhibitory T cell receptors (e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.); adoptive T cell therapies that include tissue infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and T cell receptor (TCR) modified T cells; (ii) tumor heterogeneity including changes in antigenic profiles over time and location in individual patient; and (iii) a variety of immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) including T regulatory cells (Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and immunosuppressive cytokines. In addition, complex interaction of tumor-immune system further increases the level of difficulties in the process of biomarkers development and their validation for clinical use. Recent clinical trial results have highlighted the potential for combination therapies that include immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Agents targeting other immune inhibitory (e.g., Tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., CD137) receptors on T cells and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer are tested for clinical efficacy in melanoma as well. These agents are also being tested in combination with targeted therapies to improve upon shorter-term responses thus far seen with targeted therapy. Various locoregional interventions that demonstrate promising results in treatment of advanced melanoma are also integrated with immunotherapy agents and the combinations with cytotoxic chemotherapy and inhibitors of angiogenesis are changing the evolving landscape of therapeutic options and are being evaluated to prevent or delay resistance and to further improve survival rates for melanoma patients' population. This meeting's specific focus was on advances in immunotherapy and combination therapy for melanoma. The importance of understanding of melanoma genomic background for development of novel therapies and biomarkers for clinical application to predict the treatment response was an integral part of the meeting. The overall emphasis on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward integrating biomarkers into personalized-medicine approach for treatment of patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. Translation of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across different tumors represents a bridge to impact on prognosis and response to therapy in melanoma. We also discussed the requirements for pre-analytical and analytical as well as clinical validation process as applied to biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. The concept of the fit-for-purpose marker validation has been introduced to address the challenges and strategies for analytical and clinical validation design for specific assays."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We found immune activation coexistent with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, TIM-3, B7-H3, BTLA, and CTLA-4, along with increases in tumor infiltration by CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in lung adenocarcinomas that displayed an EMT phenotype", "answer_start": 1181}], "question": "Is TIM-3 a target for cancer immunotherapy in NSCLC?", "id": "5c7a4c35d774d04240000007_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "PURPOSE: Promising results in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been seen with agents targeting immune checkpoints, such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1).

Comprehensive analysis of mRNA gene expression, reverse-phase protein array, IHC, and correlation with clinical data were performed.RESULTS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is highly associated with an inflammatory tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma, independent of tumor mutational burden. We found immune activation coexistent with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, TIM-3, B7-H3, BTLA, and CTLA-4, along with increases in tumor infiltration by CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in lung adenocarcinomas that displayed an EMT phenotype.

Immune checkpoint blockade improves survival in a subset of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but robust biomarkers that predict response to PD-1 pathway inhibitors are lacking.

We performed comprehensive flow cytometric immunoprofiling on both tumor and immune cells from 51 NSCLCs and integrated this analysis with clinical and histopathologic characteristics, next-generation sequencing, mRNA expression, and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS. Cytometric profiling identified an immunologically \"hot\" cluster with abundant CD8+ T cells expressing high levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 and an immunologically \"cold\" cluster with lower relative abundance of CD8+ T cells and expression of inhibitory markers. The \"hot\" cluster was highly enriched for expression of genes associated with T cell trafficking and cytotoxic function and high PD-L1 expression by IHC. There was no correlation between immunophenotype and KRAS or EGFR mutation, or patient smoking history, but we did observe an enrichment of squamous subtype and tumors with higher mutation burden in the \"hot\" cluster.

In contrast to these observations there are now numerous examples to suggest that a number of tumours escape this CTL-mediated control either by down-regulating accessory molecules or by blocking the intracellular processing of tumour-specific antigens. Recently a number of tumour cell lines have been identified which display a transcriptional deficiency of transporters associated with antigen processing (also referred to as TAP). The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumour, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), is a classic example in this category. In the present study we have restored class I-restricted antigen processing in a BL cell line by transfecting a minigene expression vector encoding a CTL epitope derived from EBV linked to an endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal sequence. These minigene transfected BL cells were not only susceptible to lysis by virus-specific CTL but were also capable of efficiently activating an antigen-specific CTL response. Interestingly, the immunogenicity of these BL cells was not affected by the significantly down-regulated expression of adhesion molecules such as LFA1 alpha, LFA1 beta and LFA3.

The first true clinical progress with immunotherapy developed from the application of recombinant DNA technology for the large scale production of immunostimulant cytokines. Clinical trials demonstrated that the systemic administration of recombinant high-dose bolus intravenous interleukin-2 (IL-2; 720 000 IU/kg every 8 hours) mediated objective tumour progression in 20% of patients with metastatic renal cancer and in 17% of patients with metastatic melanoma, with complete responses of 9% and 7%, respectively. The use of adoptive immunotherapy (the transfer of immune cells with anti-tumour activity to the tumour-bearing host) focused interest on T lymphocyte-mediated tumour recognition. Clinical trials described the systemic administration of lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells and subsequently tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) to patients with advanced cancer. Although able to kill tumour targets in vitro, LAK cells did not prove useful for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cancer. A randomised trial, in which IL-2 was administered alone or with LAK cells, failed to show a difference in response rate or survival. In contrast, the treatment of 86 patients with metastatic melanoma using TIL plus IL-2 resulted in a 34% objective response rate, which included patients who had previously failed treatment with high-dose IL-2 alone. The focus on cellular immune responses, combined with rapid biotechnological advances, resulted in the identification of tumour specific antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, that could be recognised by autologous TIL. This provided fundamental evidence of the existence of melanoma-associated antigens that were recognised in vivo by effector cells of the immune system. In vitro studies demonstrated immunodominant epitopes from MART-1 and gp100 that could induce in vitro-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte reactivity. To enhance in vitro immunogenicity, single amino acid substitutions were made to identify peptides with higher affinity for HLA-A*0201. Modified peptides from gp100 were compared with the parental peptide for increased immunogenicity based on their ability to induce anti-tumour lymphocytes in vitro. From these studies, a candidate peptide was identified (G9-209-2M) which had increased immunogenic reactivity in vitro. Clinical trials demonstrated that the modified G9-209-2M peptide was more effective. Unfortunately, objective tumour regression was still low. However, when high-dose IL-2 was combined with G9-209-2M objective clinical responses increased to 42%. Efforts to find better ways to immunise against self antigens are ongoing and involve further peptide immunisations, as well as recombinant viral vectors, adjuvant cytokine therapy and cellular adjuvants such as dendritic cells."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity, because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system.", "answer_start": 800}], "question": "Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?", "id": "5c7f806d617e120c34000001_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed.

These professional antigen-presenting cells endocytose and process TSA to display antigenic peptides on their MHC class II molecules for indirect cancer cell recognition by CD4(+) T cells. We hypothesized that this critical step may depend on secretion of TSA by cancer cells. This was investigated in a mouse model for myeloma immunosurveillance mediated by CD4(+) T cells. From this study, several conclusions could be drawn. First, TSA secretion facilitates cancer immunosurveillance. Second, TSA secretion results in stronger activation of naïve tumour-specific CD4(+) T cells in lymph nodes. Third, TSA concentration within the tumour extracellular matrix must reach a certain threshold to allow successful cancer immunosurveillance. Fourth, treatment by local injection of purified TSA enhances immunity against cancer cells that do not secrete TSA. Fifth, secretion of TSA by at least some cancer cells within a tumour favours antitumour immunity. Therefore, we propose that CD4(+) T cells that recognize secreted TSA may be superior for immunotherapy by T cell transfer, because the local extracellular antigen concentration will be higher for secreted TSA. Thus, it is anticipated that secreted TSA will be more readily detected in vivo by transferred CD4(+) T cells, resulting in more efficient tumour eradication."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " Here, we wondered whether these frame-shifted peptide (FSP) sequences represent tumour-specific antigens also for MSI(+) leukaemia and lymphomas (L/L).", "answer_start": 305}], "question": "Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?", "id": "5c7f806d617e120c34000001_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "PURPOSE: Microsatellite instability (MSI) resulting from loss of functional DNA mismatch repair was recently found in various haematological disorders.

The proteins that tether Tpr to this location are unknown. Moreover, the question whether Tpr itself might act as a scaffold onto which other NPC components need to be assembled has not been answered to date. To assess Tpr's role as an architectural element of the NPC, we have studied the sequential disassembly and reassembly of NPCs in mitotic cells, paralleled by studies of cells depleted of Tpr as a result of posttranscriptional tpr gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi). NPC assembly and recruitment of several nucleoporins, including Nup50, Nup93, Nup96, Nup98, Nup107, and Nup153, in anaphase/early telophase is shown to precede NPC association of Tpr in late telophase. In accordance, cellular depletion of Tpr by RNAi does not forestall binding of these nucleoporins to the NPC. In a search for proteins that moor Tpr to the NPC, we have combined the RNAi approach with affinity-chromatography and yeast two-hybrid interaction studies, leading to the identification of nucleoporin Nup153 as the binding partner for Tpr. The specificity of this interaction is demonstrated by its sensitivity to Tpr amino acid substitution mutations that abolish Tpr's ability to adhere to the NPC and affect the direct binding of Tpr to Nup153. Accordingly, cellular depletion of Nup153 by RNAi is shown to result in mislocalization of Tpr to the nuclear interior. Nup153 deficiency also causes mislocalization of Nup50 but has no direct effect on NPC localization of the other nucleoporins studied in this investigation.

Results from common assessment time points were pooled.RESULTS: At 12 weeks, the least squares (LS) mean change in total score on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale among 100 patients randomized to ADS-5102 and 96 patients randomized to placebo was - 17.7 (standard error [SE] 1.3) vs. - 7.6 (1.3) points, respectively (- 10.1 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 13.8, - 6.5; p < 0.0001). The relative treatment difference between groups was 27.3% (p < 0.0001). At 12 weeks, the LS mean change in OFF time was - 0.59 (0.21) vs. +0.41 (0.20) h/day, a difference of - 1.00 h/day (95% CI - 1.57, - 0.44; p = 0.0006). For both efficacy measures, a significant difference from placebo was attained by two weeks, the first post-baseline assessment, and was maintained throughout 12 weeks.

In vitro induction of BRAF(V600E)  in PCCL3 cells caused a significant increase in both uPA and uPAR mRNAs. Higher levels of uPA and uPAR correlated with lymph node metastases, TNM stage and disease recurrences. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses demonstrated that uPA and uPAR were associated with shorter DFI, while the BRAF(V600E)  was not.CONCLUSION: In PTC, BRAF(V600E)  induces uPA and uPAR expression. The latter, but not BRAF(V600E) , associates with advanced stages and shorter DFI.
