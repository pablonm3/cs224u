The specific pan-Pim kinase inhibitor AZD1208 as well as PIM447 in combination with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 cooperatively downregulated the mTORC1/4EBP1 pathway, formation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex, and Mcl-1 expression leading to activation of Bak and Bax to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis synergistically in these cells. These cooperative effects were enhanced or inhibited by knock down of mTOR or expression of its activated mutant, respectively. Overexpression of Mcl-1 conferred the resistance on 32D/ITD cells to combined inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway and Pim kinases, while the Mcl-1-specific BH3 mimetic A-1210477 conquered the resistance of MV4-11 cells to GDC-0941.

We accessed the population-based databases of Manitoba Health (single provincial health insurer) to get age-, gender-, and geography-matched non-IBD controls (n = 310). We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure serum antibodies.RESULTS: Seropositivity for measles and mumps was similar in controls (98.1%, 78.4%, respectively) as in CD (96.2%, 72.3% respectively) and in UC (95.5%, 74.6%, respectively). However, controls were significantly more likely to be seropositive for rubella (98.1%) than were CD cases (91.0%, P < 0.0002) or UC cases (93.3%, P = 0.01). Males accounted for the significantly lower rates of seropositivity to rubella with CD. While we determined that significantly more controls than CD were vaccinated, we cannot be sure if the increased rate of rubella seropositivity in controls is secondary to wildtype or vaccine-associated infection.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest there is no association of having acquired measles, mumps, or rubella (by natural infection or through vaccination) and CD or UC.

Typically, the disease is characterized by a two-phase course. After an average incubation period of 8 to 11 days, initial symptoms such as fever, cough, coryza and conjunctivitis appear. Two thirds of the patients shows a white-marked enanthema on the buccal mucosa (Koplik's spots). After disappearance of these symptoms, a second increase of temperature and the typical measles exanthema, a brownish-red maculopapular rash, appear. Infection with measles virus induces transient immunodeficiency that favours the formation of several complications. Some of them, e. g. encephalitic diseases, are severe and associated with a high mortality. Measles are world-wide distributed and belong to the ten most frequent infectious diseases in some less developed countries. The disease is associated with a high mortality in some African and South-East Asian countries, in particular in children aged less than 12 months. Of particular note, measles are the most important cause of blindness in children in population with borderline vitamin A status. In Germany, the number of reported measles cases has been declined dramatically since the introduction of a vaccine more than four decades ago. However, regional outbreaks or small epidemics still occur. Because there is no specific antiviral treatment, therapy of measles is symptomatic and depends on the manifestation of the disease. The most important prevention strategy is immunization with a life-attenuated vaccine that can be applied as monovaccination or in combination with mumps and rubella virus (MMR vaccination) or mumps, rubella and varicella virus (MMRV vaccination)."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Mumps is a Paramyxoviridae virus.

This disease was rampant prior to introduction of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, resulting in decreased incidence. This disease has demonstrated several outbreaks.OBJECTIVE: This review provides a focused evaluation of mumps, an update on outbreaks, management recommendations, and ways to decrease transmission.DISCUSSION: Clusters of mumps outbreaks continue to occur. The virus is a paramyxovirus, a single-stranded RNA virus. The vaccine can provide lifelong immunity if administered properly, though prior to 1967 and introduction of the vaccine, the virus was common. In the past decade, there have been several notable outbreaks. Humans are the only known hosts, with disease spread through exposure to droplets and saliva. Factors affecting transmission include age, compromised immunity, time of year, travel, and vaccination status. Upper respiratory symptoms, fever, and headache are common, with unilateral or bilateral parotitis, and the virus may spread to other systems. Diagnosis is clinical, though polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin testing are available. This review provides several recommendations for vaccine in pregnancy, patients living in close quarters, health care personnel, and those immunocompromised. Treatment is generally supportive, with emphasis on proper isolation to prevent widespread outbreaks. Although reporting regulations and procedures vary by state, mumps is reportable in most states.CONCLUSIONS: Mumps is an easily spread virus. Although vaccination is the most effective way to prevent transmission, early recognition of the disease is crucial. As an emergency physician, it is important to recognize the clinical presentation, recommended testing, treatment, and isolation procedures.Published by Elsevier Inc."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Since chronic paramyxovirus infection with measles is known to be accompanied by increased production of antiviral antibodies", "answer_start": 420}], "question": "List 3 human diseases caused by  viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae.", "id": "5e4163b848dab47f2600000f_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a common skeletal disorder characterised by focal abnormalities of increased and disorganised bone turnover. Genetic factors play a central role in the pathogenesis of PDB but environmental factors also contribute. Measles virus (MV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) have all been implicated as potential disease triggers but the data are conflicting. Since chronic paramyxovirus infection with measles is known to be accompanied by increased production of antiviral antibodies, we have analysed circulating concentrations of antibodies to MV, CDV, and RSV as well as mumps, rubella and varicella zoster virus (VZV) in 463 patients with PDB and 220 aged and gender-matched controls. We also studied the relation between viral antibody concentrations and various markers of disease severity and extent in 460 PDB patients. A high proportion of cases and controls tested positive for antiviral antibodies but there was no significant difference in circulating antibody concentrations between PDB cases and controls for MV, CDV, RSV, rubella or VZV. However, mumps virus antibody levels were significantly higher in the PDB cases (mean ± SD = 3.1 ± 0.84 vs. 2.62 ± 0.86. p < 0.001). There was no association between disease severity and circulating antibody concentrations to any of the viruses. In conclusion, we found no evidence to suggest that PDB is associated with abnormalities of immune response to measles or other paramyxoviruses, although there was evidence of a greater antibody response to mumps.

Using a selective NKB receptor (NK3R) antagonist, the role of NKB in the hypergonadotropic state in menopausal women was explored.METHODS: Eleven postmenopausal women were administered the NK3R antagonist MLE4901 at 40 mg twice daily orally for 7 days. Ten-minute blood sampling for 8 h was performed before and on the last day of NK3R antagonist treatment for luteinising hormone (LH) pulsatility analysis with kisspeptin-10 (0.3 µg/kg i.v. bolus) administered at 6 h on both days.

Basal (non-pulsatile) LH secretion was reduced (549.0 ± 70.8 vs. 366.1 ± 92.1 IU/L/6 h, p = 0.006), and while the LH pulse frequency did not change in the group as a whole (from 0.8 ± 0.1 to 0.7 ± 0.1 pulses/h, ns), it did fall in the 8 women with hot flashes (from 1.0 ± 0.1 to 0.7 ± 0.1 pulses/h, p < 0.05).

Continuous EGFR inhibition of first-generation resistant tumors by sequential treatment with afatinib plus/minus cetuximab, followed by osimertinib, represented an effective therapeutic strategy in this model. Whereas T790M resistance mutation was not detected, a major mechanism of acquired resistance was the activation of components of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. This phenomenon was accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Cell lines established in vitro from gefitinib-, or afatinib- or osimertinib-resistant tumors showed metastatic properties and maintained EGFR-TKIs resistance in vitro, that was reverted by the combined blockade of Hh, with the selective SMO inhibitor sonidegib, and EGFR.CONCLUSIONS: EGFR-mutant NSCLC can benefit from continuous treatment with EGFR-inhibitors, indepenently from mechanisms of resistance. In a complex and heterogenous scenario, Hh showed an important role in mediating resistance to EGFR-inhibitors through the induction of mesenchymal properties."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Dual targeting of EGFR using one monoclonal antibody (mAb; cetuximab or panitumumab) and one tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI; gefitinib or erlotinib) is a potential therapeutic approach.

Dual targeting of EGFR using one monoclonal antibody (mAb; cetuximab or panitumumab) and one tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI; gefitinib or erlotinib) is a potential therapeutic approach. We investigated the effect of these therapies in EGFR-expressing TNBC cell lines that do or do not harbor the main activating mutations of EGFR pathways. Cell lines were sensitive to EGFR-TKIs, whereas mAbs were active only in MDA-MB-468 (EGFR amplification) and SUM-1315 (KRAS and PTEN wild-type) cells. MDA-MB-231 (KRAS mutated) and HCC-1937 (PTEN deletion) cells were resistant to mAbs. The combined treatment resulted in a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and superior inhibition of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in mAb-sensitive cells. The anti-proliferative effect was associated with G1 cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Sensitivity to therapies was characterized by induction of positive regulators and inactivation of negative regulators of cell cycle. These results suggest that dual EGFR inhibition might result in an enhanced antitumor effect in a subgroup of TNBC. The status of EGFR, KRAS and PTEN could be used as a molecular marker for predicting the response to this therapeutic strategy."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": ".

In precursor B cells, however, surface expression of mu-H chain in the absence of surrogate and conventional L chain has been identified. Despite this, Ag-specific single H chain Ig repertoires, using mu-, gamma-, epsilon-, or alpha-H chains found in conventional Abs, are not produced. Moreover, removal of H chain or, separately, L chain (kappa/lambda) locus core sequences by gene targeting has prevented B cell development. In contrast, H chain-only Abs are produced abundantly in Camelidae as H2 IgG without the C(H)1 domain. To test whether H chain Abs can be produced in mice, and to investigate how their expression affects B cell development, we introduced a rearranged dromedary gamma2a H chain into the mouse germline. The dromedary transgene was expressed as a naturally occurring Ag-specific disulphide-linked homodimer, which showed that B cell development can be instigated by expression of single H chains without L chains. Lymphocyte development and B cell proliferation was accomplished despite the absence of L chain from the BCR complex. Endogenous Ig could not be detected, although V(D)J recombination and IgH/L transcription was unaltered. Furthermore, crossing the dromedary H chain mice with mice devoid of all C genes demonstrated without a doubt that a H chain-only Ab can facilitate B cell development independent of endogenous Ig expression, such as mu- or delta-H chain, at early developmental stages."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "he neoplastic proliferation of single clones of plasma cells causes synthesis of very large amount of monoclonal immunoglobulins consisting of only one type of heavy either the gamma, alpha, mu, delta or epsilon chain ", "answer_start": 1}], "question": "List the 5 different human immunoglobulin heavy chains.", "id": "5e4f0a4f6d0a277941000031_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The neoplastic proliferation of single clones of plasma cells causes synthesis of very large amount of monoclonal immunoglobulins consisting of only one type of heavy either the gamma, alpha, mu, delta or epsilon chain or only kappa or lambda light chains.
