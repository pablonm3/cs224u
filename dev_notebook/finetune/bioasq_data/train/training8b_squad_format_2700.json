Certain of the component parts are well known, but the overall picture is blurred and often confusing. Small genome species have chromosomes in their interphase nuclei disposed in diffuse chromosome territories, without any Rabl arrangement, while in large genomes the chromosomes run string-like through the nucleus with a Rabl orientation following through the cell cycle. What happens in genomes of intermediate size is either a bit of both, depending on the tissue being studied, or still remains to be determined. The centromeres are the most dynamic and least well understood part of the nucleus, subject to rapid evolutionary change and with an epigenetic mark based on a special form of histone CENH3. Nonetheless, the centromere epigenetic mark has been inherited for millions of years by a process that is a complete mystery. Centromeres are involved with the dynamic interactions between chromosomes and other parts of the nuclear environment, such as the nuclear matrix and inner nuclear membrane, and they also engage with the spindle when the order within the nucleus changes during its division. The nucleolus organizer regions have likewise posed tantalising problems about their massive amplification of rDNA sequences, and how they are regulated and expressed. Some of these issues are now becoming clearer with advances in the science and the ongoing development of new molecular tools. These developments are discussed in this contribution, with particular reference to the centromere and the nucleolus organizer."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The Rabl orientation is an example of the non-random arrangement of chromosomes, centromeres are grouped in a limited area near the nuclear periphery and telomeres are located apart from centromeres.", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "Where do centromeres locate according to the Rabl orientation of eukaryotic nuclei?", "id": "5a89528dfcd1d6a10c000001_012", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Chromosomes are not packed randomly in the nucleus.

Here we dissected functional topography of silencers and boundary elements within circular minichromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that both HML-E and HML-I silencers can efficiently repress the URA3 reporter on a multi-copy yeast minichromosome and we further showed that two distinct heterochromatin boundary elements STAR and TEF2-UASrpg are able to limit the heterochromatin spreading in circular minichromosomes.

Thus the STAR and TEF2-UASrpg boundary elements inhibit chromatin silencing through an antisilencing activity independently of their position or orientation in S. cerevisiae minichromosomes rather than by creating a position-specific barrier as seen in the genome.

PTH-stimulated bone-forming indices were all significantly lower in Postn(-/-) mice, particularly at the periosteum. Furthermore, in vivo stimulation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling by PTH, as evaluated in TOPGAL reporter mice, was inhibited in the absence of periostin (TOPGAL;Postn(-/-) mice). PTH stimulated periostin and inhibited MEF2C and sclerostin (Sost) expression in bone and osteoblasts in vitro. Recombinant periostin also suppressed Sost expression, which was mediated through the integrin αVβ3 receptor, whereas periostin-blocking antibody prevented inhibition of MEF2C and Sost by PTH. In turn, administration of a Sost-blocking antiboby partially restored the PTH-mediated increase in bone mass in Postn(-/-) mice. In addition, primary osteoblasts from Postn(-/-) mice showed a lower proliferation, mineralization, and migration, both spontaneously and in response to PTH. Osteoblastic gene expression levels confirmed a defect of Postn(-/-) osteoblast differentiation with and without PTH, as well as an increased osteoblast apoptosis in the absence of periostin.

Signaling through synaptic and extrasynaptic GluN2B-NMDARs has already been implicated in the pathophysiology of various other neurological disorders.

Small nerve fibers are altered earlier during the course of the disease; hence, detection of their involvement may have serious consequences on the natural history of disease.METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study, was carried out on symptomatic patients, involving the conduct of several tests for small nerve fibers: Vibration, Touch Pressure (TP) and Heat Pain (HP). Results were compared with those obtained during a conventional neurological examination carried out on a group of healthy individuals.RESULTS: Fifteen symptomatic patients were recruited at an early stage of the disease (60% stage 1), along with 13 healthy individuals, with both patient groups having similar epidemiological characteristics in terms of gender, age, weight, height or BMI. A comparison carried out between the neuropsychological tests performed revealed statistically significant differences: Vibration (P<.05), TP (P<.05) and HP (P<.05, except volar forearm).CONCLUSIONS: The neurophysiological tests performed revealed significant differences between both groups, allowing for an earlier detection of neurological injuries compared to conventional neurological examinations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

Since its first description, more than 120 amyloidogenic transthyretin mutations have been reported with various geographic distributions and associated with a wide range of phenotypes involving the peripheral nerve, the heart, the gastrointestinal tract, the eyes, the central nervous system, or the kidneys. In some cases of transthyretin amyloidosis, the first clinical manifestation is vitreous opacity.CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Bangladeshi woman presented with vitreous amyloidosis and progressive autonomic neuropathy of the digestive tract as initial clinical manifestations, with no clinical evidence of cardiac, renal, central nervous system, or peripheral nerve dysfunction. A novel transthyretin mutation, p.Gly87Arg, was identified in the heterozygous state in this proband of Bangladeshi origin. Histological examination of accessory salivary glands and gastric biopsies revealed Congo-red-positive deposits. Laser microdissection of salivary gland Congo-red deposits and tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis identified the mutated transthyretin peptide containing the arginine residue at position 87 of the mature protein.CONCLUSIONS: Vitreous amyloidosis should be considered a differential diagnosis of uveitis, in particular transthyretin amyloidosis. Proteomics data from our case, consistent with the genetic findings, highly suggests that this new p.Gly87Arg variant is amyloidogenic.

The tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence measurements typically used to study structural changes of TTR do not yield site-specific information on the two Trp residues per TTR protomer. To obtain such information, tryptophan labeled with fluorine at the 5 and 6 positions (5FW and 6FW) was incorporated into TTR. Fluorescence of 5FW and 6FW-labeled WT-TTR (WT-5FW and WT-6FW) and a single-Trp mutant W41Y showed that the photophysics of incorporated fluoro-Trp is consistent with site-specific solvation of the indole ring of W41 and W79. 19F-NMR showed that solvent accessibility depends on both the location of the Trp and the position of the fluorine substituent in the indole ring. Unexpectedly, differences were observed in the rates of aggregation, with WT-6FW aggregating more rapidly than WT-5FW or WT-TTR. Real-time 19F-NMR urea unfolding experiments revealed that WT-5FW is kinetically more stable than WT-6FW, consistent with the aggregation assay. In addition, structural perturbations of residues distant from either Trp site are more extensive in WT-6FW. Notably, residues in the dimer interfaces are perturbed by 6FW at residue 79; pathogenic mutations in these regions are associated with reduced tetramer stability and amyloidogenesis. The differences in behavior that arise from the replacement of a fluorine at the 5-position of a tryptophan with one at the adjacent 6-position emphasize the delicate balance of stability in the TTR tetramer."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Transthyretin (TTR), normally a plasma circulating protein, can become misfolded and aggregated, ultimately leading to extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils usually targeted to heart or nerve tissues.

Referred to as TTR-associated amyloidoses (ATTR), this group of diseases is frequently life threatening and fatal if untreated. ATTR, caused by amyloid-forming variant TTR proteins (ATTRm) that arise from point mutations in the TTR gene, were classically referred to as familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC) or familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), reflecting the clinical phenotype. FAC and FAP are pathologies that can be challenging to diagnose as there are no definitive biomarkers of disease; moreover, disease-specific measures of progression are lacking, and treatment options are limited. Thus, the discovery of sensitive and specific indicators of disease has the potential to improve recognition, enable accurate measurement of amyloid progression and response to treatment, and reveal key information regarding FAC and FAP pathobiological mechanisms. In this study, the goal was to investigate serum proteomic features unique to FAC and FAP types of ATTRm. Multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS), a powerful technique in profiling proteomes, was used to measure the serum concentrations of 160 proteins in samples from FAC and FAP patients. Results were compared to data from healthy control sera obtained from individuals matched to age (≥60 years), gender (male), and race (Caucasian). Proteomic analyses of ATTRm (FAC and FAP) and control samples showed significant concentration differences in 107 of 192 (56%) of the serum proteins that were studied. In comparing FAC to FAP, differences in concentrations as well as interactions and functions of several proteins were identified as unique to each disease; significantly lower levels of TTR were specific to FAC, but not to FAP. Annotated functional clustering identified extracellular region, signal, and signal peptide as terms common to FAC and FAP. Conversely, disulfide bond was unique to FAC; secreted, glycosylation site: N-linked, glycosylation, glycoprotein, polymorphism, and sequence variant were associated solely with FAP. Predicted protein-protein associations in FAC were seen for reaction, binding, and activation processes; no associations were found in FAP. This study demonstrates significant proteomic differences between ATTRm patient and control sera, as well as ATTRm phenotype-associated variations in the circulating levels of several proteins including TTR. The identification of serum proteins unique to FAC and FAP may have diagnostic and prognostic utility and could possibly provide important clues about disease mechanisms."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Cebocephaly is a very rare congenital midline facial anomaly characterized by a blind-ended single nostril and ocular hypotelorism, and is usually combined with alobar holoprosencephaly.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is cebocephaly", "id": "5a87124561bb38fb24000001_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Cebocephaly is a very rare congenital midline facial anomaly characterized by a blind-ended single nostril and ocular hypotelorism, and is usually combined with alobar holoprosencephaly.

Among the questionnaires that are commonly used for obstructive sleep apnoea screening, it remains unclear whether the STOP-BANG or Berlin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome questionnaire is more effective in terms of ease of use, usage period and diagnosis of surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnoea risk.DESIGN: This study was designed as a descriptive and prospective study.METHODS: The study included 126 patients over 18 years of age who were American Society of Anesthesiologists classification class I-II and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To determine the potential obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome risk, the STOP-BANG and Berlin questionnaires were administered. Respiratory complications were then observed during the perioperative period.RESULTS: During intubation and extubation, we observed statistically significant differences in difficult intubation, difficult facemask ventilation and desaturation frequency between the high- and low-risk groups for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire. During extubation, statistically significant differences in coughing, breath-holding and desaturation frequency were observed between the high-risk and low-risk groups, according to the Berlin questionnaire. In the post-anaesthesia care unit, both questionnaires found statistically significant differences between the low- and high-risk groups.CONCLUSION: Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome screening questionnaires administered during the preoperative period are useful for predicting perioperative respiratory complications.

RSV is transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets either directly from an infected person or self-inoculation by contaminated secretions on surfaces. Patients with RSV bronchiolitis usually present with two to four days of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, and congestion, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms such as increasing cough, wheezing, and increased respiratory effort. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated its clinical practice guideline for diagnosis and management of RSV bronchiolitis to minimize unnecessary diagnostic testing and interventions. Bronchiolitis remains a clinical diagnosis, and diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended. Treatment of RSV infection is mainly supportive, and modalities such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, and antibiotics are generally not useful. Evidence supports using supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation; however, continuous pulse oximetry is no longer required. The other mainstay of therapy is intravenous or nasogastric administration of fluids for infants who cannot maintain their hydration status with oral fluid intake.

Such a disease is characterized by an infection of epithelial cells of the distal airways that leads to inflammation and subsequently to respiratory failure. Upon infection, different pattern recognition receptors recognize the virus and trigger the innate immune response against the hRSV. Further, T cell immunity plays an important role for virus clearance. Based on animal studies, it is thought that the host immune response to hRSV is based on a biased T helper (Th)-2 and Th17 T cell responses with the recruitment of T cells, neutrophils and eosinophils to the lung, causing inflammation and tissue damage. In contrast, human immunity against RSV has been shown to be more complex with no definitive T cell polarization profile. Nowadays, only a humanized monoclonal antibody, known as palivizumab, is available to protect against hRSV infection in high-risk infants. However, such treatment involves several injections at a significantly high cost. For these reasons, intense research has been focused on finding novel vaccines or therapies to prevent hRSV infection in the population. Here, we comprehensively review the recent literature relative to the immunological features during hRSV infection, as well as the new insights into preventing the disease caused by this virus."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Palivizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes antigenic site II on both the prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F glycoprotein, is the only prophylactic agent approved for use for the treatment of RSV infection.

However, its relatively low neutralizing potency and high cost have limited its use to a restricted population of infants at high risk of severe disease. Previously, we isolated a high-potency neutralizing antibody, 5C4, that specifically recognizes antigenic site Ø at the apex of the pre-F protein trimer. We compared in vitro and in vivo the potency and protective efficacy of 5C4 and the murine precursor of palivizumab, antibody 1129. Both antibodies were synthesized on identical murine backbones as either an IgG1 or IgG2a subclass and evaluated for binding to multiple F protein conformations, in vitro inhibition of RSV infection and propagation, and protective efficacy in mice. Although 1129 and 5C4 had similar pre-F protein binding affinities, the 5C4 neutralizing activity was nearly 50-fold greater than that of 1129 in vitro In BALB/c mice, 5C4 reduced the peak titers of RSV 1,000-fold more than 1129 did in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. These data indicate that antibodies specific for antigenic site Ø are more efficacious at preventing RSV infection than antibodies specific for antigenic site II. Our data also suggest that site Ø-specific antibodies may be useful for the prevention or treatment of RSV infection and support the use of the pre-F protein as a vaccine antigen.IMPORTANCE There is no vaccine yet available to prevent RSV infection. The use of the licensed antibody palivizumab, which recognizes site II on both the pre-F and post-F proteins, is restricted to prophylaxis in neonates at high risk of severe RSV disease. Recommendations for using passive immunization in the general population or for therapy in immunocompromised persons with persistent infection is limited because of cost, determined from the high doses needed to compensate for its relatively low neutralizing potency. Prior efforts to improve the in vitro potency of site II-specific antibodies did not translate to significant in vivo dose sparing. We isolated a pre-F protein-specific, high-potency neutralizing antibody (5C4) that recognizes antigenic site Ø and compared its efficacy to that of the murine precursor of palivizumab (antibody 1129) matched for isotype and pre-F protein binding affinities. Our findings demonstrate that epitope specificity is an important determinant of antibody neutralizing potency, and defining the mechanisms of neutralization has the potential to identify improved products for the prevention and treatment of RSV infection."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended for infants with qualifying high risk conditions.

It is the second largest cause of mortality, after malaria, in infants outside the neonatal period and causes up to 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. RSV results in clinical syndromes that include upper respiratory tract infections, otitis media, bronchiolitis (up to 80% of cases) and lower respiratory tract disease including pneumonia and exacerbations of asthma or viral-induced wheeze. For the purposes of this review we will focus on RSV bronchiolitis in infants in whom the greatest disease burden lies. For infants requiring hospital admission, the identification of the causative respiratory virus is used to direct cohorting or isolation and infection control procedures to minimize nosocomial transmission. Nosocomial RSV infections are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including increased mortality, the need for mechanical ventilation and longer length of hospital stay. Numerous clinical guidelines for the management of infants with bronchiolitis have been published, although none are specific for RSV bronchiolitis. Ribavirin is the only licensed drug for the specific treatment of RSV infection but due to drug toxicity and minimal clinical benefit it has not been recommended for routine clinical use. There is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent RSV infection but passive immunoprophylaxis using a monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, reduces the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection by 39-78% in various high-risk infants predisposed to developing severe RSV disease. The current management of RSV bronchiolitis is purely supportive, with feeding support and oxygen supplementation until the infant immune system mounts a response capable of controlling the disease.

The aim of this study was to clarify changes in lymphangiogenesis and VEGF expression induced by androgen deprivation in prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro.METHODS: Patients who had undergone a radical prostatectomy were enrolled in the study (NHT, n = 60 and non-NHT, n = 64). Lymph vessels were identified by D2-40 immunoreactivity and lymph vessel density and lymph vessel area (LVD and LVA, respectively) were measured from micrographs. The expression of VEGF-A, -B, -C, and -D was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of LVD and LVA for biochemical recurrence was also investigated.RESULTS: Mean LVD ± SD was higher in the NHT than in the non-NHT group (11.3 ± 3.0 vs. 7.1 ± 3.4 per high power field; P < 0.001). LVA was larger in the NHT than in the non-NHT group (512.8 ± 174.9 vs. 202.7 ± 72.8 µm2 ; P < 0.001). VEGF-A expression was lower whereas VEGF-C and -D levels were higher in the NHT than in the non-NHT group.

The persistence in time of a high PAR level affects the DNA methylation machinery; the DNA methyltransferase activity is inhibited with consequences for the methylation state of genome, which becomes diffusely hypomethylated affecting centromeric minor satellite and B1 DNA repeats. In vitro data show that CTCF is able to activate PARP-1 automodification even in the absence of nicked DNA. Our new finding that CTCF is able per se to activate PARP-1 automodification in vitro is of great interest as so far a burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 has generally been found following introduction of DNA strand breaks. CTCF is unable to inhibit DNMT1 activity, whereas poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 plays this inhibitory role.

Aspiration biopsies and microbiology were carried out. Gross pathology of the tumors and their metastatic potential were assessed. The tumors were excised and further characterized using histopathology, cytology, electron microscopy (EM), molecular markers and Mouse mammary Tumor Virus - Long Terminal Repeats (MMTV LTR) specific RT-PCR.RESULTS: The tumors originated from 2nd or 5th or both the mammary glands and were multi-nodulated with variable central necrosis accompanied with an accumulation of inflammatory exudate. Significant increases in estrogen, SGPT, SGOT and neutrophils levels were noticed. Histopathologically, invasive nodular masses of pleomorphic tubular neoplastic epithelial cells invaded fibro-vascular stroma, adjacent dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Metastatic spread through hematogenous and regional lymph nodes, into liver, lungs, spleen, heart and dermal lymphatics was observed. EM picture revealed no viral particles and MMTV-negativity was confirmed through MMTV LTR-specific RT-PCR. High expression of ER alpha, moderate to high expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), moderate expression of vimentin and Cytokeratin 19 (K19) and low expression of p53 were observed in tumor sections, when compared with that of the normal mammary gland.CONCLUSION: Since 75% of human breast cancer were classified ER-positive and as our model mimics (in most of the characteristics, such as histopathology, metastasis, high estrogen levels) the ER-positive luminal epithelial-like human breast cancer, this model will be an attractive tool to understand the biology of estrogen-dependant breast cancer in women.

Eligible patients are 18-85 years old with hATTR amyloidosis, investigator-estimated survival of ≥2 years, Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of 5-130, and polyneuropathy disability score ≤IIIb. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either intravenous patisiran 0.3 mg/kg or placebo once every 3 weeks. The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of patisiran at 18 months based on the difference in the change in modified NIS+7 (a composite measure of motor strength, sensation, reflexes, nerve conduction, and autonomic function) between the patisiran and placebo groups. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of patisiran on Norfolk-Diabetic Neuropathy quality of life questionnaire score, nutritional status (as evaluated by modified body mass index), motor function (as measured by NIS-weakness and timed 10-m walk test), and autonomic symptoms (as measured by the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score-31 questionnaire). Exploratory objectives include assessment of cardiac function and pathologic evaluation to assess nerve fiber innervation and amyloid burden.

Among various strategies, amyloid β immunotherapy has been extensively investigated in Alzheimer's disease, followed by similar studies of α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease. Notably, a recent study of solanezumab, an amyloid β monoclonal antibody, raises hope for the further therapeutic potential of immunotherapy, not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Thus, it is expected that further refinement of immunotherapy against neurodegenerative diseases may lead to increasing efficacy. Meanwhile, type II diabetes mellitus has been associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and studies have shown that metabolic dysfunction and abnormalities surrounding insulin signaling may underlie disease progression. Naturally, \"anti-insulin resistance\" therapy has emerged as a novel paradigm in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, incretin agonists, which stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion, reduce dopaminergic neuronal loss and suppress Parkinson's disease disease progression in clinical trials. Similar studies are ongoing also in Alzheimer's disease. This paper focuses on critical issues in \"immunotherapy\" and \"anti-insulin resistance\" therapy in relation to therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative disease, and more importantly, how they might merge mechanistically at the point of suppression of protein aggregation, raising the possibility that combined immunotherapy and \"anti-insulin resistance\" therapy may be superior to either monotherapy."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "For example, Eli Lilly announced a major change to its closely watched clinical trial for the Alzheimer's drug solanezumab which failed to reach statistical significance.

It has been problematic to use conjugated peptides with Th1/Th2 adjuvants to induce immune responses against conformational epitopes formed by Aβ oligomers, which is critical to induce protective antibodies. Hence, vaccination should mimic natural immunity by using whole or if possible conjugated antigens, but biasing the response to Th2 with anti-inflammatory adjuvants. Also, selection of the carrier and cross-linking agents is important to prevent suppression of the immune response against the antigen. That certain compounds having phosphorylcholine or fucose induce a sole Th2 immunity would allow antigens with T-cell epitopes without inflammatory autoimmune reactions to be used. Another immunization method is DNA vaccines combined with antigenic ones, which favors the clonal selection and expansion of high affinity antibodies needed for immune protection, but this also requires Th2 immunity. Since AD transgenic mouse models have limited value for immunogen selection as shown by the clinical studies, screening may require the use of validated antibodies and biophysical methods to identify the antigens that would be most likely recognized by the human immune system and thus capable to stimulate a protective antibody response. To induce an anti-Alzheimer's disease protective immunity and prevent possible damage triggered by antigens having B-cell epitopes-only, whole antigens might be used; while inducing Th2 immunity with sole anti-inflammatory fucose-based adjuvants.

Patients with FMF and concomitant diseases were included to the study.Results: Among 600 FMF patients, 77 were found to have a concomitant disease (12.8%). Thirty patients (5%) had vasculitis; 21 (3.5%) had juvenile idiopathic artritis (JIA); 7 (1.16%) had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 19 had other diseases including 5 patients with isolated sacroiliitis.

NLRP3 down-modulation was induced by in vitro silencing of the NLRP3 gene.RESULTS: LPS-stimulated monocytes from patients with FMF displayed enhanced IL-1β secretion, which correlated with number and penetrance of MEFV mutations. Silencing of NLRP3 consistently inhibited IL-1β secretion. As in other autoinflammatory diseases, FMF monocytes produced more ROS than genetically negative cells from HDs. Unlike in cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes (CAPS), however, they were characterised by a conserved and sustained antioxidant response. Consistent with this finding, activated MEFV-mutated monocytes did not exhibit the functional indicators of oxidative stress observed in CAPS, including accelerated IL-1β secretion and deficient production of IL-1Ra.CONCLUSIONS: MEFV-mutated monocytes display enhanced IL-1β secretion, which correlates with number of high-penetrance mutations and level of endogenous ROS. Unlike NLRP3-mutated cells, monocytes carrying MEFV mutations withstand oxidative stress and preserve IL-1Ra production, thereby limiting inflammation. Finally, in contrast with that found in the animal model, the increased secretion of IL-1β by LPS-stimulated FMF monocytes is NLRP3-dependent."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive inherited autoinflammatory syndrome.

Expression plasmids of wild-type (WT) pyrin and mutated pyrin, such as E148Q, M694I, M694V, and E148Q+M694I, were constructed, and SW982 synovial sarcoma cells were transfected with these expression plasmids. IL-8 and IL-6 were spontaneously secreted from the culture supernatant of SW982 cells without any stimulation, whereas IL-1β and TNF-α could not be detected even when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Notably, two inflammasome components, ASC and caspase-1, could not be detected in SW982 cells by Western blotting. IL-8 but not IL-6 secretion from SW982 cells was largely suppressed by WT pyrin, but less suppressed by mutated pyrin, which appeared to become weaker in the order of E148Q, M694I, E148Q+M694I, and M694V mutations. As for IL-8 and IL-6, similar results were obtained using stable THP-1 cells expressing the WT pyrin or mutated pyrins, such as M694V or E148Q, when stimulated by LPS. In addition, IL-8 secretion from mononuclear cells of FMF patients was significantly higher than that of healthy volunteers when incubated on a culture plate.

However, heterozygosity might be coincidental in many patients due to the very high rate of mutations in Mediterranean populations.OBJECTIVE: To better delineate the pathogenicity of heterozygosity in order to improve genetic counselling and disease management.METHODS: Complementary statistical approaches were used: estimation of FMF prevalence at population levels, genotype comparison in siblings from 63 familial forms, and genotype study in 557 patients from four Mediterranean populations.RESULTS: At the population level, we did not observe any contribution of heterozygosity to disease prevalence. In affected siblings of patients carrying two MEFV mutations, 92% carry two mutated alleles, whereas 4% are heterozygous with typical FMF diagnosis. We demonstrated statistically that patients are more likely to be heterozygous than healthy individuals, as shown by the higher ratio heterozygous carriers/non carriers in patients (p<10(-7)-p<0.003). The risk for heterozygotes to develop FMF was estimated between 2.1 × 10(-3) and 5.8 × 10(-3) and the relative risk, as compared to non carriers, between 6.3 and 8.1.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first statistical demonstration that heterozygosity is not responsible for classical Mendelian FMF per se, but constitutes a susceptibility factor for clinically-similar multifactorial forms of the disease.

A total of 56 heterozygous mutations were identified in COL1A1 and COL1A2, including 43 mutations in COL1A1 and 13 mutations in COL1A2. Among the 56 causative COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations, 24 novel mutations were found, and 25 (44.6%) resulted in the substitution of a glycine within the Gly-X-Y triplet domain of the triple helix. Compared with COL1A1 haploinsufficiency (n = 23), patients with mutations affecting glycine residues had a severe skeletal phenotype. In patients 18 years of age or older, on average patients with COL1A1 haploinsufficiency were taller and had higher femoral neck bone mineral density than with patients with helical mutations. Interestingly, we found two novel compound heterozygous mutations in the LEPRE1 gene in two unrelated families with autosomal recessive OI.

To identify the molecular cause of OI type V, we performed whole-exome sequencing in a female with OI type V and her unaffected parents and searched for de novo mutations.

Subsequently, we identified an identical heterozygous de novo mutation in a second individual with OI type V by Sanger sequencing, thereby confirming that this is the causal mutation for the phenotype. IFITM5 is a protein that is highly enriched in osteoblasts and has a putative function in bone formation and osteoblast maturation. The mutation c.-14C>T introduces an upstream start codon that is in frame with the reference open-reading frame of IFITM5 and is embedded into a stronger Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation than the annotated start codon. In vitro, eukaryotic cells were able to recognize this start codon, and they used it instead of the reference translation initiation signal.

This regimen was followed by a 12-week extension phase in which the placebo group was switched to apremilast and a 28-day post-treatment observational follow-up phase. The patients and clinicians were unaware of the study assignments throughout the trial. The primary end point was the number of oral ulcers at week 12.

In March 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved apremilast for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. The properties of apremilast were evaluated to determine its specificity, effects on intracellular signaling, gene and protein expression, and in vivo pharmacology using models of innate and adaptive immunity. Apremilast inhibited PDE4 isoforms from all four sub-families (A1A, B1, B2, C1, and D2), with IC50 values in the range of 10 to 100 nM. Apremilast did not significantly inhibit other PDEs, kinases, enzymes, or receptors. While both apremilast and thalidomide share a phthalimide ring structure, apremilast lacks the glutarimide ring and thus fails to bind to cereblon, the target of thalidomide action. In monocytes and T cells, apremilast elevated intracellular cAMP and induced phosphorylation of the protein kinase A substrates CREB and activating transcription factor-1 while inhibiting NF-κB transcriptional activity, resulting in both up- and down-regulation of several genes induced via TLR4. Apremilast reduced interferon-α production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and inhibited T-cell cytokine production, but had little effect on B-cell immunoglobulin secretion. In a transgenic T-cell and B-cell transfer murine model, apremilast (5mg/kg/day p.o.) did not affect clonal expansion of either T or B cells and had little or no effect on their expression of activation markers. The effect of apremilast on innate immunity was tested in the ferret lung neutrophilia model, which allows monitoring of the known PDE4 inhibitor gastrointestinal side effects (nausea and vomiting). Apremilast significantly inhibited lung neutrophilia at 1mg/kg, but did not induce significant emetic reflexes at doses <30 mg/kg. Overall, the pharmacological effects of apremilast are consistent with those of a targeted PDE4 inhibitor, with selective effects on innate immune responses and a wide therapeutic index compared to its gastrointestinal side effects."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We show here that RNA splicing speckled domains (splicing speckles) fluctuate in constrained nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes.", "answer_start": 254}], "question": "Are splicing speckles associated with transcription?", "id": "5a8965f6fcd1d6a10c000005_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Despite being densely packed with chromatin, nuclear bodies and a nucleoskeletal network, the nucleus is a remarkably dynamic organelle.

Since some RBM proteins are candidate alternative splicing factors we examined whether one such member of the family, RBM6, exhibited a pattern of nuclear distribution and targeting consistent with this role. Using antibodies raised against mouse RBM6 to immunostain mammalian cell lines we found that the endogenous protein was both distributed diffusely in the nucleus and concentrated in a small number of nuclear foci that corresponded to splicing speckles/interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs). Tagged RBM6 was also targeted to IGCs, although it accumulated in large bodies confined to the IGC periphery. The basis of this distribution pattern was suggested by the targeting of tagged RBM6 in the giant nuclei (or germinal vesicles (GVs)) of Xenopus oocytes. In spread preparations of GV contents RBM6 was localized both to lampbrush chromosomes and to the surface of many oocyte IGCs, where it was confined to up to 50 discrete patches. Each patch of RBM6 labelling corresponded to a bead-like structure of 0.5-1 microm diameter that assembled de novo on the IGC surface. Assembly of these novel structures depended on the repetitive N-terminal region of RBM6, which acts as a multimerization domain. Without this domain, RBM6 was no longer excluded from the IGC interior but accumulated homogeneously within it. Assembly of IGC-surface structures in mammalian cell lines also depended on the oligomerization domain of RBM6. Oligomerization of RBM6 also had morphological effects on its other major target in GVs, namely the arrays of nascent transcripts visible in lampbrush chromosome transcription units. The presence of oligomerized RBM6 on many lampbrush loops caused them to appear as dense structures with a spiral morphology that appeared quite unlike normal, extended loops. This distribution pattern suggests a new role for RBM6 in the co-transcriptional packaging or processing of most nascent transcripts."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Only 20 years after the discovery of small non-coding, single-stranded ribonucleic acids, so-called microRNAs (miRNAs), as post-transcriptional gene regulators, the first miRNA-targeting drug Miravirsen for the treatment of hepatitis C has been successfully tested in clinical Phase II trials.

Setting 1040 Thai community pharmacists. Method A cross-sectional survey of community pharmacists was conducted in November 2012 to March 2013. The self-administered questionnaires were mailed to 57 % of community pharmacists in the south of Thailand (n = 1040). The survey included questions on diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis, knowledge on pharyngitis, and attitudes and control beliefs regarding antibiotic dispensing. Main outcome measure The appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis according to the original and modified Centor criteria and determinants of antibiotic dispensing including demographic characteristics of pharmacists, knowledge on pharyngitis, and attitudes and control beliefs on antibiotic dispensing. Results Approximately 68 % completed the questionnaires (n = 703).

Little is known about how the pharmacists identify patients with bacterial pharyngitis. Objective To ascertain the appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis among Thai community pharmacists according to the Centor criteria and to identify factors related to antibiotic dispensing. Setting 1040 Thai community pharmacists. Method A cross-sectional survey of community pharmacists was conducted in November 2012 to March 2013. The self-administered questionnaires were mailed to 57 % of community pharmacists in the south of Thailand (n = 1040). The survey included questions on diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis, knowledge on pharyngitis, and attitudes and control beliefs regarding antibiotic dispensing. Main outcome measure The appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis according to the original and modified Centor criteria and determinants of antibiotic dispensing including demographic characteristics of pharmacists, knowledge on pharyngitis, and attitudes and control beliefs on antibiotic dispensing. Results Approximately 68 % completed the questionnaires (n = 703). Compared to the pharmacists who reported not dispensing antibiotics in the hypothetical case with common cold, those reported dispensing antibiotics were more likely to consider the following conditions-presence of cough, mild sore throat and patients with age >60 years as cues for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis (p < 0.05).

The aim is to optimize drug use and dosing regimens to improve the clinical efficacy. The present study was selected following a structured prioritizing process by independent experts.METHODS: This phase IV study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study with non-inferiority design regarding the therapeutic use of penicillin V with two parallel groups. The overall aim is to study if the total exposure with penicillin V can be reduced from 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days to 800 mg four times daily for 5 days when treating Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield group A) pharyngotonsillitis. Patients will be recruited from 17 primary health care centers in Sweden. Adult men and women, youth and children ≥6 years of age who consult for sore throat and is judged to have a pharyngotonsillitis, with 3-4 Centor criteria and a positive rapid test for group A streptococci, will be included in the study. The primary outcome is clinical cure 5-7 days after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment. Follow-up controls will be done by telephone after 1 and 3 months. Throat symptoms, potential relapses and complications will be monitored, as well as adverse events. Patients (n = 432) will be included during 2 years.DISCUSSION: In the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance and the shortage of new antimicrobial agents it is necessary to revisit optimal usage of old antibiotics. Old antimicrobial drugs are often associated with inadequate knowledge on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and lack of optimized dosing regimens based on randomized controlled clinical trials. If a shorter and more potent treatment regimen is shown to be equivalent with the normal 10 day regimen this can imply great advantages for both patients (adherence, adverse events, resistance) and the community (resistance, drug costs).TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number 2015-001752-30 .

C- reactive protein (CRP) was not recommended for sore throats. Inappropriate use of RADT and CRP has been reported in several studies.METHODS: From a larger project 16 general practitioners (GPs) who stated management of sore throats not according to the guidelines were identified. Half-hour long semi-structured interviews were conducted. The topics were the management of sore throats and the use of near-patient tests. Qualitative content analysis was used.RESULTS: The use of the near-patient test interplayed with the clinical assessment and the perception that all infections caused by bacteria should be treated with antibiotics. The GPs expressed a belief that the clinical picture was sufficient for diagnosis in typical cases. RADT was not believed to be relevant since it detects only one bacterium, while CRP was considered as a reliable numerical measure of bacterial infection.CONCLUSIONS: Inappropriate use of near-patient test can partly be understood as remnants of outdated knowledge.

All the patients were examined clinically using the Centor Criteria. They were also examined for other signs and symptoms like petechial lesions over the palate, abdominal pain, and skin rash. All the patients were given rapid strep tests, and throat cultures were sent. No antibiotics were given until culture results were obtained.RESULTS: The sample size was 100 patients. All 100 had fever, sore throat, and erythema of tonsils. Twenty of the 100 patients had tonsillar exudates, 85/100 had tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, and 86/100 had no cough. In total, 9 out of the 100 patients had positive throat cultures. We observed that petechiae over the palate, a very significant sign, is not included in the Centor Criteria.

The discrimination between the pathogen and a non-pathogen is essential for C. elegans in a microbial niche which determines its survival. Training the nematodes in the presence of a virulent pathogen (S. aureus) and an opportunistic pathogen (P. mirabilis) separately exhibits a different behavioural paradigm. This appears to be dependent on the CREB transcription factor. Here we show that C. elegans homolog crh-1 helps in memory response for a short term against the interacting pathogens. Following conditioning of the nematodes to S. aureus and P. mirabilis, the wild type nematodes exhibited a positive response towards the respective pathogens which diminished slowly after 2h. By contrast, the crh-1 deficient nematodes had a defective memory post conditioning. The molecular data reinforces the importance of crh-1 gene in retaining the memory of nematode. Our results also suggest that involvement of neurotransmitters play a crucial role in modulating the memory of the nematode with the assistance of CREB.

A mouse genetic study showed that cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription is required for the formation of social recognition memory.

It is well known that molecules like cAMP response element binding (CREB) and binding protein (CBP) play a crucial role in memory consolidation. We analyzed CBP on its transcriptional activity and protein levels, finding a significant downregulation of both of them at 3-month-old mice. In addition, the downregulation of this molecule was associated with a decrease on acetylation levels of histone H3 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, the p-CREB levels, which are important for memory acquisition at 3 months in APP/PS1 mice, were downregulated. Furthermore, we suggest that early neuroinflammation, especially due to the Tnfα gene increased expression, could also be responsible to this process of memory loss. Given all the previously mentioned results, we propose that an early suitable treatment to prevent the evolution of the disease should include a combination of drugs, including anti-inflammatories, which may decrease glial activation and Tnfα levels, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors that increase cAMP levels."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Therefore, CREB phosphorylation may be responsible for signal transduction during the early phase of long-term memory formation, whereas CREB SUMOylation sustains long-term memory", "answer_start": 1583}], "question": "Is CREB a key memory protein?", "id": "5a893da7bc7bade53a000001_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and signaling plays an important role in long-term memory formation, but other posttranslational modifications of CREB are less known.

Moreover, transduction of Lenti-CREBWT to rat CA1 area facilitated, whereas transduction of Lenti-CREB double sumo-mutant (CREBK271RK290R) impaired, spatial learning and memory performance. Transduction of Lenti-CREBWT-SUMO1 fusion vector to rat CA1 area showed a more significant effect in enhancing spatial learning and memory and CREB SUMOylation. Lenti-CREBWT transduction increased, whereas Lenti-CREBK271RK290R transduction decreased, CREB DNA binding to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) promoter and decreased bdnf mRNA expression. Knock-down of PIAS1 expression in CA1 area by PIAS1 siRNA transfection impaired spatial learning and memory and decreased endogenous CREB SUMOylation. In addition, CREB SUMOylation was CREB phosphorylation dependent and lasted longer.

Lesional skin biopsy samples were taken from this patient and 2 others with refractory PRP. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of proinflammatory innate and T-cell-derived cytokines were measured and compared with skin samples from patients with psoriasis and healthy donors. From 1 patient, lesional skin samples were taken before ustekinumab treatment and 4 and 28 weeks after treatment initiation. Follow-up was completed after 6 months.Intervention: Subcutaneous ustekinumab, 45 mg, at weeks 0 and 4 and quarterly thereafter.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was to determine the changes in expression of proinflammatory innate and T-cell-derived cytokines during ustekinumab therapy. The secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical and histopathologic phenotype in relation to the mRNA expression profile of proinflammatory cytokines.Results: In lesional PRP skin samples from a single patient, upregulated expression levels were found for most proinflammatory innate cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and IL-1β. Among adaptive T-cell cytokines, an increase of TH1 cytokines and, in particular, TH17 cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 was seen in PRP. The patient with PRP who received ustekinumab showed regression of skin lesions after 2 weeks and almost complete resolution after 1 month. Clinical and histopathologic improvement paralleled the expression levels of TH17 cytokines but not of interferon-γ and TNF, which lagged behind the amelioration.Conclusions and Relevance: In this case report, a role of the IL-23-TH17-axis in PRP was identified, suggesting a shared pathogenic inflammatory pathway with psoriasis, despite evident clinical and histopathologic differences.

None of the untreated hepatocyte donors showed appreciable expression of the IL-12 or IL-23 receptors. Similar results were seen with whole human liver samples. Exposure of hepatocytes to IL-12 and/or IL-23, known P450 suppressors (IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) or known P450 inducers (β-naphthoflavone, phenobarbital, and rifampicin) did not appreciably alter the expression of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptors either. Finally, in contrast to the positive control IL-6, expression of the acute phase C-reactive protein was unaltered following IL-12 and/or IL-23 treatment.

The primary end point was the proportion of patients with at least 75% improvement in the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI) at week 12; a secondary end point was the proportion with cleared or minimal disease on the basis of the physician's global assessment. Assessors were unaware of the treatment assignments.

Similarly, 65.1% of patients who received 45 mg of ustekinumab and 70.6% of patients who received 90 mg of ustekinumab had cleared or minimal disease according to the physician's global assessment, as compared with 49.0% of those who received etanercept (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients who did not have a response to etanercept, 48.9% had at least 75% improvement in the PASI within 12 weeks after crossover to ustekinumab.

Thus, strategies to modulate the effects of these immune cells may offer a potential therapeutic benefit. We report here that tasquinimod, a novel immunotherapy which targets S100A9 signaling, reduces the immunosuppressive properties of myeloid cells in preclinical models of bladder cancer (BCa). As single anticancer agent, tasquinimod treatment was effective in preventing early stage tumor growth, but did not achieve a clear antitumor effect in advanced tumors. Investigations of this response revealed that tasquinimod induces an increase in the expression of a negative regulator of T cell activation, Programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This markedly weakens its antitumor immunity, yet provokes an \"inflamed\" milieu rendering tumors more prone to T cell-mediated immune attack by PD-L1 blockade. Interestingly, the combination of tasquinimod with an Anti-PD-L1 antibody enhanced the antitumor immune response in bladder tumors. This combination synergistically modulated tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, thereby strongly affecting proliferation and activation of effector T cells. Together, our data provide insight into the rational combination of therapies that activate both innate and adaptive immune system, such as the association of S100A9-targeting agents with immune checkpoints inhibitors, to improve the response to cancer immunotherapeutic agents in BCa."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The treatment landscape of advanced melanoma has changed significantly following the discovery and marketing authorisation of immune checkpoints inhibitors.

We found that the gene family in Eucalyptus is slightly smaller than that in Populus and Arabidopsis, but all phylogenetic groups are represented. High-throughput expression profiling of different organs and tissues highlighted several Aux/IAA genes expressed in vascular cambium and/or developing xylem, some showing differential expression in response to developmental (juvenile vs. mature) and/or to environmental (tension stress) cues. Based on the expression profiles, we selected a promising candidate gene, EgrIAA4, for functional characterization. We showed that EgrIAA4 protein is localized in the nucleus and functions as an auxin-responsive repressor. Overexpressing a stabilized version of EgrIAA4 in Arabidopsis dramatically impeded plant growth and fertility and induced auxin-insensitive phenotypes such as inhibition of primary root elongation, lateral root emergence and agravitropism.

Our classification consists of Partial Angular (PA), Partial Vertical (PV), Total Angular (TA) and Total Vertical (TV, formerly O'Connell Types I-III). Total vertical has a continuous cranium, and inter-twin axial facial rotation <40 degrees (Type I), 140-180 degrees (Type II) or intermediate (Type III).

Our review categorized 64 well-delineated CPT, including 41 operative separation attempts in small children since initial success in 1952. Just over one-half were TV, almost one-third TA, and partial forms accounted for the remaining one-sixth. About 30% of CPT had shared or fused brain tissue, and a similar percentage of TA twins shared a posterior fossa. Partial forms had significantly higher birth weights, were separated at an earlier age (6 versus 11 months) and had lower mortality and better outcome compared with Total forms.

Conjoined twinning, however, only arises when the twinning event occurs at about the primitive streak stage of development, at about 13-14 days after fertilisation in the human, and is exclusively associated with the monoamniotic monochorionic type of placentation. It is believed that the highest incidence of conjoined twinning is encountered in the human. While monozygotic twinning may be induced experimentally following exposure to a variety of agents, the mechanism of induction of spontaneous twinning in the human remains unknown. All agents that are capable of acting as a twinning stimulus are teratogenic, and probably act by interfering with the spindle apparatus.DISCUSSION: The incidence of the various types of conjoined twinning is discussed. Information from the largest study to date indicates that the spontaneous incidence is about 10.25 per million births. The most common varieties encountered were thoraco-omphalopagus (28%), thoracopagus (18.5%), omphalopagus (10%), parasitic twins (10%) and craniopagus (6%). Of these, about 40% were stillborn, and 60% liveborn, although only about 25% of those that survived to birth lived long enough to be candidates for surgery. Conjoined twinning occurs by the incomplete splitting of the embryonic axis and, with the exception of parasitic conjoined twins, all are symmetrical and \"the same parts are always united to the same parts\". Fusion of monozygotic twins is no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning.

However, the position where a sequence starts or ends can be totally arbitrary due to a number of reasons: arbitrariness in the linearisation (sequencing) of a circular molecular structure; or inconsistencies introduced into sequence databases due to different linearisation standards. These scenarios are relevant, for instance, in the process of multiple sequence alignment of mitochondrial DNA, viroid, viral or other genomes, which have a circular molecular structure. A solution for these inconsistencies would be to identify a suitable rotation (cyclic shift) for each sequence; these refined sequences may in turn lead to improved multiple sequence alignments using the preferred multiple sequence alignment program.RESULTS: We present MARS, a new heuristic method for improving Multiple circular sequence Alignment using Refined Sequences. MARS was implemented in the C++ programming language as a program to compute the rotations (cyclic shifts) required to best align a set of input sequences. Experimental results, using real and synthetic data, show that MARS improves the alignments, with respect to standard genetic measures and the inferred maximum-likelihood-based phylogenies, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our results show, among others, that the average pairwise distance in the multiple sequence alignment of a dataset of widely-studied mitochondrial DNA sequences is reduced by around 5% when MARS is applied before a multiple sequence alignment is performed.CONCLUSIONS: Analysing multiple sequences simultaneously is fundamental in biological research and multiple sequence alignment has been found to be a popular method for this task. Conventional alignment techniques cannot be used effectively when the position where sequences start is arbitrary. We present here a method, which can be used in conjunction with any multiple sequence alignment program, to address this problem effectively and efficiently."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The Ctf4/AND-1 protein hub, which links DNA replication, repair, and chromosome segregation, represents a novel target for the synthetic lethality approach.

During infancy, children frequently present the involvement of the pulmonary arteries (elongation, tortuosity, stenosis) with dyspnea and cyanosis. Other CTD signs of ATS are dysmorphisms, abdominal hernias, joint hypermobility, skeletal abnormalities, and keratoconus. ATS is typically described as a severe disease with high rate of mortality due to major cardiovascular malformations. ATS is caused by mutations in the SLC2A10 gene, which encodes the facilitative glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10). Approximately 100 ATS patients have been described, and 21 causal mutations have been identified in the SLC2A10 gene.CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the clinical findings and molecular characterization of three new ATS families, which provide insight into the clinical phenotype of the disorder; furthermore, we expand the allelic repertoire of SLC2A10 by identifying two novel mutations. We also review the ATS patients characterized by our group and compare their clinical findings with previous data.CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that the cardiovascular prognosis in ATS is less severe than previously reported and that the first years of life are the most critical for possible life-threatening events.

Mutations in SLC2A10/GLUT10, a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family, are associated with altered transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling in patients with arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS). The objective of this work was to test whether SLC2A10/GLUT10 can serve as a link between TGFβ-related transcriptional regulation and metabolism during development. In zebrafish embryos, knockdown of slc2a10 using antisense morpholino oligonucleotide injection caused a wavy notochord and cardiovascular abnormalities with a reduced heart rate and blood flow, which was coupled with an incomplete and irregular vascular patterning. This was phenocopied by treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor of TGFβ receptor (tgfbr1/alk5). Array hybridization showed that the changes at the transcriptome level caused by the two treatments were highly correlated, revealing that a reduced tgfbr1 signaling is a key feature of ATS in early zebrafish development. Interestingly, a large proportion of the genes, which were specifically dysregulated after glut10 depletion gene and not by tgfbr1 inhibition, play a major role in mitochondrial function. Consistent with these results, slc2a10 morphants showed decreased respiration and reduced TGFβ reporter gene activity. Finally, co-injection of antisense morpholinos targeting slc2a10 and smad7 (a TGFβ inhibitor) resulted in a partial rescue of smad7 morphant phenotypes, suggesting scl2a10/glut10 functions downstream of smads.

With this rationale the present study was carried out with physiological, biochemical and proteomic perspectives. Treatment of FA was given to the leaves of tomato directly through infiltration to show the characteristic features of Fusarium wilt of tomato. The phytotoxic effect of FA was assessed in the form of cell death in tomato leaves which was observed by increased uptake of Evans blue stain. The measurement of electrolyte leakage was used as an indicator of the extent of cell death. The influence of FA on the leaf photosynthesis of tomato plant was investigated and it was found that FA strongly reduced the photosynthetic pigment contents of tomato leaves resulting to heavy suppression of leaf photosynthesis processes, which therefore affected leaf physiology finally leading to leaf wilting and necrosis. This cell death inducer (FA) produced an enormous oxidative burst during which large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) like H2O2 was generated in the treated leaf tissues of tomato plants which was evident from enhancement in lipid peroxidation. To assess the involvement of proteolysis in the cell death cascade induced by FA treatment, total protease activity was measured in the leaf tissues and it was found that the total protease activity increased with the treatment and leading to cell death. Furthermore, proteomic study was used as a powerful tool to understand the alterations in cellular protein expression in response to FA exposure. Differential expression in several proteins was observed in the present study. Proteomic analyses, thus, clearly indicate that proteins belonging to different functional classes are significantly affected in the plant leaf tissues after FA exposure leading to deterioration of structure and metabolism of cells.

Among antiangiogenic drugs, only bevacizumab demonstrated an improvement of progression-free survival (HR=0.63, p<0.001), both alone (HR=0.60, p=0.003) or in combination to chemotherapy (HR=0.63; p<0.001), both as first-line treatment (HR=0.70, p<0.001) or in recurrent disease (HR=0.52, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: antiangiogenic drugs did not improve overall survival in glioblastoma patients, either as first or second-line treatment, and either as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Among antiangiogenic drugs, only bevacizumab improved progression-free survival regardless of treatment line, both as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, clinical translation of this therapy has been limited by issues including fast blood clearance, high kidney and liver uptake, poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, low tumor specificity and rapid washout from tumors. In this study, these issues were tackled in an integrated manner using a multi-stage strategy combining ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) with CGT nanotherapy. CGT nanoparticles (CGT-NP) prepared using gelatin and Poloxamer 188-grafted heparin copolymer demonstrated significant apoptotic and cytotoxic effects in C6 GBM cells. Biodistribution study in a rat GBM model demonstrated buildup of high CGT level in tumors subjected to CGT-NP+UTMD combined therapy. The tumor CGT level in these animals was increased over 3-fold, tumor retention of CGT prolonged and renal clearance significantly reduced when compared with free CGT with or without UTMD. CGT-NP+UTMD treatment was further shown to extend the median survival period from less than 20days in the control and about 30days in free CGT group to about 80days. This was achieved with low CGT dosing level (2mg/kg twice weekly). In situ monitoring of GFAP, Ki67, caspase-3, Beclin-1, and LC-3 in the tumor samples together with TUNEL assay, transmission electron microscope imaging and Western blot assay all demonstrated high apoptotic and autophagy activities induced by the combined therapy.

Several manipulative maneuvers have been described, although, the most effective treatment technique is yet unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the two most commonly performed maneuvers (supination-flexion and hyperpronation) in the treatment of nursemaid's elbow.METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to identify randomized controlled trials comparing supination-flexion and hyperpronation. Data were extracted and pooled independently by two authors. Methodological quality assessment of included studies was performed. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model in case of homogeneity across studies, and using a random-effect model in case of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was calculated with the χ2 test and inconsistency in study effects across trials was quantified by I2 values.RESULTS: Seven randomized trials, including 701 patients (62% female), were included. A total of 350 patients were treated with the hyperpronation maneuver versus 351 patients who underwent the supination-flexion maneuver. Meta-analysis showed that hyperpronation was more effective than supination-flexion (risk ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.49; I2, 35%). The absolute risk difference between maneuvers was 26% in favor of hyperpronation, resulting in a number needed to treat of 4 patients.

It often results from a sudden pull on the arm, usually by an adult or taller person, which pulls the radius through the annular ligament, resulting in subluxation (partial dislocation) of the radial head. It can also be caused by a fall or twist. The child experiences sudden acute pain and loss of function in the affected arm. Pulled elbow is usually treated by manual reduction of the subluxed radial head. Various manoeuvres can be applied; most commonly, supination of the forearm, often combined with flexion, and (hyper-)pronation. It is unclear which is most successful. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and last updated in 2011.OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects (benefits and harms) of the different methods used to manipulate pulled elbow in young children.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, clinical trial registers and reference lists of articles. Date of last search: September 2016.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating manipulative interventions for pulled elbow were included. Our primary outcome was failure at the first attempt, necessitating further treatment.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently evaluated trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model.MAIN RESULTS: Overall, nine trials with 906 children (all younger than seven years old and 58% of whom were female) were included, of which five trials were newly identified in this update. Eight trials were performed in emergency departments or ambulatory care centres, and one was performed in a tertiary paediatric orthopaedic unit. Four trials were conducted in the USA, three in Turkey, one in Iran, and one in Spain. Five trials were at high risk of selection bias because allocation was not concealed and all trials were at high risk of detection bias due to the lack of assessor blinding. Eight trials compared hyperpronation with supination-flexion. We found low-quality evidence that hyperpronation resulted in less failure at first attempt than supination-flexion (9.2% versus 26.4%, risk ratio (RR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.50; 811 participants, 8 studies). Based on an illustrative risk of 268 failures at first attempt per 1000 children treated using supination-flexion, this amounted to 174 fewer failures per 1000 children treated using hyperpronation (95% CI 134 to 201 fewer). Based on risk differences data, we also estimated a number needed to treat of 6 (95% CI 5 to 8); this means that six children would need to be treated with the hyperpronation method rather than the supination-flexion method to avoid one additional failure at the first attempt.The very low-quality evidence (from four studies) for pain during or after manipulation means that it is uncertain whether there is or is not a difference between pronation and supination-flexion. There was very low-quality evidence from six studies that repeat pronation may be more effective than repeat supination-flexion for the second attempt after initial failure. The remaining outcomes were either not reported (adverse effects, recurrence) or unsuitable for pooling (ultimate failure). Ultimate failure, reported for the overall population only because of the differences in the study protocols with respect to what to do after the first attempt failed, ranged from no ultimate failures in two studies to six failures (4.1% of 148 episodes) in one study.One trial compared supination-extension versus supination-flexion. It provided very low-quality evidence (downgraded three levels for very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision) of no clear difference in failure at first attempt between the two methods.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was low-quality evidence from eight small trials that the pronation method may be more effective at first attempt than the supination method for manipulating pulled elbow in young children. For other outcomes, no conclusions could be drawn either because of very low-quality evidence or the outcomes not being reported. We suggest that a high-quality randomised clinical trial comparing hyperpronation and supination-flexion is required to provide definitive evidence. We recommend that this is preceded by a survey among clinicians to establish the extent of clinical equipoise and to optimise the study design and recruitment."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "INTRODUCTION: To provide an epidemiological description of radial head subluxation, also known as nursemaid's elbow, from a database of emergency department visits.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Describe nursemaid's elbow injury.", "id": "5a67b152b750ff445500000e_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "INTRODUCTION: To provide an epidemiological description of radial head subluxation, also known as nursemaid's elbow, from a database of emergency department visits.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients 6 years of age and younger, who presented to the ED between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, and were diagnosed with nursemaid's elbow.

Data were extracted and pooled independently by two authors. Methodological quality assessment of included studies was performed. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model in case of homogeneity across studies, and using a random-effect model in case of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was calculated with the χ2 test and inconsistency in study effects across trials was quantified by I2 values.RESULTS: Seven randomized trials, including 701 patients (62% female), were included. A total of 350 patients were treated with the hyperpronation maneuver versus 351 patients who underwent the supination-flexion maneuver. Meta-analysis showed that hyperpronation was more effective than supination-flexion (risk ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.49; I2, 35%). The absolute risk difference between maneuvers was 26% in favor of hyperpronation, resulting in a number needed to treat of 4 patients.

Suboptimal asthma control leads to increasing burden of healthcare costs and loss of productivity to society. Biologic therapies targeted at IgE and eosinophils can be used in poorly controlled allergic and eosinophilic asthma, respectively. The purpose of this review is to analyze the advancements in currently available biologic therapies targeted at IgE and eosinophils in asthma and to identify how these therapies may impact overall healthcare costs.RECENT FINDINGS: Omalizumab is an anti-IgE antibody that is approved for use of poorly controlled moderate-to-severe asthma. Many studies have confirmed that omalizumab not only improves quality of life and symptom scores, but also decreases urgent care and emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Dupilumab is a biologic agent targeted at TH2 cytokines, but indirectly impacts IgE and is an important biologic agent for atopic disease. Mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab target IL-5, a key cytokine for eosinophils. For patients with poorly controlled eosinophilic asthma, these biologic agents improve asthma symptoms, reduce exacerbations, and reduce emergency visits and hospitalizations.SUMMARY: Poorly controlled severe asthma affects a small portion of patients with asthma in the United States and yet it accounts for large portion of healthcare utilization. Biological therapies in poorly controlled severe persistent asthma have been identified to reduce healthcare utilization, including emergency visits and hospitalizations.

The objective of this trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of benralizumab for patients with mild to moderate, persistent asthma.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18-75 years, weighing at least 40 kg, and with a postbronchodilator reversibility in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of at least 12% at screening, from 52 clinical research centres in six countries. Patients must have been receiving either low- to medium-dosage inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or low-dosage ICS plus long-acting β2 agonist fixed-combination therapy at screening, had a morning prebronchodilator FEV1 of more than 50% to 90% predicted at screening, and had one or more of the following symptoms within the 7 days before randomisation: a daytime or night-time asthma symptom score of at least 1 for at least 2 days, rescue short-acting β2 agonist use for at least 2 days, or night-time awakenings due to asthma for at least one night. We converted patients' ICS treatments to 180 μg or 200 μg budesonide dry powder inhaler twice daily for the entire duration of the study using the approved dosages in the patients' respective countries and randomly allocated them (1:1; stratified by blood eosinophil count [<300 cells per μL vs ≥300 cells per μL] and region [USA vs the rest of the world]) with an interactive web-based voice response system to receive subcutaneous placebo or benralizumab 30 mg injections every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. All patients and investigators involved in patient treatment or clinical assessment and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was change from baseline prebronchodilator FEV1 at week 12. Efficacy analyses used an intention to treat approach. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02322775.FINDINGS: Between Feb 2, 2015, and April 24, 2015, we enrolled 351 patients, with 211 (60%) randomly assigned (105 [50%] to placebo and 106 [50%] to benralizumab). Benralizumab resulted in an 80 mL (95% CI 0-150; p=0·04) greater improvement (least-squares mean difference) in prebronchodilator FEV1 after 12 weeks than did placebo (placebo group: 2246 mL [SD 768] at baseline vs 2261 mL [796] at week 12, change from baseline of 0 mL; benralizumab group: 2248 mL [606] vs 2310 mL [670], 70 mL). 44 (42%) patients in the benralizumab group had adverse events compared with 49 (47%) in the placebo group. The most common adverse events for both groups were nasopharyngitis (eight [8%] patients in each group) and upper respiratory tract infections (five [5%] patients in each group). Serious adverse events occurred in two (2%) patients each in the benralizumab (pancytopenia and a suicide attempt, both considered unrelated to treatment) and placebo (cervix carcinoma and colon adenoma) groups.INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that active and modifiable disease processes might be ongoing in patients with mild to moderate, persistent asthma receiving ICS. Although the lung function improvement observed does not warrant use of benralizumab in this population because it did not reach the minimum clinically important difference of 10%, further studies to assess this finding should be considered.FUNDING: AstraZeneca.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated whether benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha subunit of the interleukin-5 receptor that significantly reduces the incidence of asthma exacerbations, was also effective as an oral glucocorticoid-sparing therapy in patients relying on oral glucocorticoids to manage severe asthma associated with eosinophilia.METHODS: In a 28-week randomized, controlled trial, we assessed the effects of benralizumab (at a dose of 30 mg administered subcutaneously either every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks [with the first three doses administered every 4 weeks]) versus placebo on the reduction in the oral glucocorticoid dose while asthma control was maintained in adult patients with severe asthma. The primary end point was the percentage change in the oral glucocorticoid dose from baseline to week 28. Annual asthma exacerbation rates, lung function, symptoms, and safety were assessed.RESULTS: Of 369 patients enrolled, 220 underwent randomization and started receiving benralizumab or placebo. The two benralizumab dosing regimens significantly reduced the median final oral glucocorticoid doses from baseline by 75%, as compared with a reduction of 25% in the oral glucocorticoid doses in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The odds of a reduction in the oral glucocorticoid dose were more than 4 times as high with benralizumab as with placebo. Among the secondary outcomes, benralizumab administered every 4 weeks resulted in an annual exacerbation rate that was 55% lower than the rate with placebo (marginal rate, 0.83 vs. 1.83, P=0.003), and benralizumab administered every 8 weeks resulted in an annual exacerbation rate that was 70% lower than the rate with placebo (marginal rate, 0.54 vs. 1.83, P<0.001). At 28 weeks, there was no significant effect of either benralizumab regimen on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), as compared with placebo. The effects on various measures of asthma symptoms were mixed, with some showing significant changes in favor of benralizumab and others not showing significant changes. Frequencies of adverse events were similar between each benralizumab group and the placebo group.CONCLUSIONS: Benralizumab showed significant, clinically relevant benefits, as compared with placebo, on oral glucocorticoid use and exacerbation rates. These effects occurred without a sustained effect on the FEV1.

The primary end point was the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (scores range from 4 to 28, with lower scores indicating a more efficient use of strategy and planning). Secondary end points were the scores for working memory (scores range from 0 to 279, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), episodic memory (scores range from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), and psychomotor speed (scores range from 100 to 5100 msec, with faster times representing better performance). Assessments of cognitive function were performed at baseline, week 24, yearly, and at the end of the trial. The primary analysis was a noninferiority comparison of the mean change from baseline in the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function between the patients who received evolocumab and those who received placebo; the noninferiority margin was set at 20% of the standard deviation of the score in the placebo group. Results A total of 1204 patients were followed for a median of 19 months; the mean (±SD) change from baseline over time in the raw score for the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (primary end point) was -0.21±2.62 in the evolocumab group and -0.29±2.81 in the placebo group (P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.85 for superiority). There were no significant between-group differences in the secondary end points of scores for working memory (change in raw score, -0.52 in the evolocumab group and -0.93 in the placebo group), episodic memory (change in raw score, -1.53 and -1.53, respectively), or psychomotor speed (change in raw score, 5.2 msec and 0.9 msec, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, there were no associations between LDL cholesterol levels and cognitive changes. Conclusions In a randomized trial involving patients who received either evolocumab or placebo in addition to statin therapy, no significant between-group difference in cognitive function was observed over a median of 19 months.

The complication rates vary from 3 to 36%. The purpose of the study was to estimate the complication rate of volar plating of DRF and its association with AO/OTA fracture type, surgeon experience and type of volar plate.METHODS: Retrospectively, all patients treated with volar plating of a DRF between February 2009 and June 2013 at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark were included. AO/OTA fracture type, surgeon experience (1st year, 2nd-5th year resident or consultant), type of plate (VariAx®, Acu-Loc®) and complications were extracted from the electronic medical records. Complications were categorized as carpal tunnel syndrome, other sensibility issues, tendon complications including irritation and rupture, deep infections, complex regional pain syndrome and unidentified DRUJ or scapholunar problems. Reoperations including hardware removal were also charted.RESULTS: 576 patients with a median age of 63 years (min: 15; max: 87) were included. 78% were female and the mean observation time was 3.2 years (min: 2.0; max: 5.4). 78% (n=451) of the patients were treated with VariAx® and 22% (n=125) with Acu-Loc®. The overall complication rate was 14.6% (95% CI 11.8-17.7) including carpal tunnel syndrome or change in sensibility in 5.2% and tendon complications in 4.7%. Five flexor tendon ruptures and 12 extensor tendon ruptures were observed. The reoperation rate was 10.4% including 41 cases of hardware removal. A statistically significant association between AO/OTA fracture type C and complications was found. No statistically significant association between complication rate and surgeon experience and type of plate was observed.CONCLUSION: The majority of DRF patients treated with a volar plate suffer no complications. However, the overall complication rate of 14.6% is substantial. Intra-articular fractures, e.g. AO/OTA-type 23C1-3, had significantly higher complication rates.

Socioeconomic status was assigned using the Carstairs score, and the population was divided into quintiles depending on deprivation. Patient demographics, mechanism of injury, fracture severity, and radiographic assessment at time of injury were assessed for epidemiological differences according to social quintile. Functional outcome was assessed using grip strength, Moberg pickup test, return to normal use of the hand, and range of movement. Radiographs were assessed at 1 week, 6 weeks, and 1 year. Complications were defined as malunion, carpal tunnel syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), persistent pain, and subjective cosmetic deformity of the wrist.RESULTS: Socioeconomically deprived patients were significantly younger (p < 0.001) and more likely to be male (p = 0.017); after adjusting for confounding factors, deprived patients were 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-4.7) years younger than the most affluent patients (p < 0.001).

The purpose of this study was to better understand how the CGRP-mAb fremanezumab (TEV-48125) modulates meningeal sensory pathways. To answer this question, we used single-unit recording to determine the effects of fremanezumab (30 mg/kg, IV) and its isotype control Ab on spontaneous and evoked activity in naive and cortical spreading depression (CSD)-sensitized trigeminovascular neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus of anesthetized male and female rats. The study demonstrates that, in both sexes, fremanezumab inhibited naive high-threshold (HT) neurons, but not wide-dynamic range trigeminovascular neurons, and that the inhibitory effects on the neurons were limited to their activation from the intracranial dura but not facial skin or cornea. In addition, when given sufficient time, fremanezumab prevents the activation and sensitization of HT neurons by CSD. Mechanistically, these findings suggest that HT neurons play a critical role in the initiation of the perception of headache and the development of cutaneous allodynia and central sensitization. Clinically, the findings may help to explain the therapeutic benefit of CGRP-mAb in reducing headaches of intracranial origin such as migraine with aura and why this therapeutic approach may not be effective for every migraine patient.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) are capable of preventing migraine. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. In the current study, we show that, if given enough time, a CGRP-mAb can prevent the activation and sensitization of high-threshold (central) trigeminovascular neurons by cortical spreading depression, but not their activation from the skin or cornea, suggesting a potential explanation for selectivity to migraine headache, but not other pains, and a predominantly peripheral site of action."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "BACKGROUND: Fremanezumab (formerly TEV-48125) is a monoclonal antibody directed against calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), a validated target for migraine preventive therapy.

In two previous phase 2 studies, fremanezumab administered once every 28 days for 12 weeks was found to be effective and safe as a preventive treatment for patients suffering from episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM).OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fremanezumab as an add-on preventive therapy in individuals with EM and CM who are on stable doses of preventive migraine medications.METHODS: Two randomized placebo-controlled studies tested once-monthly subcutaneous injections of various dosing regimens of fremanezumab versus placebo in EM and CM. Headache information was captured daily using an electronic headache diary. For these post hoc analyses, data were pooled from patients who were on stable preventive medications and taking fremanezumab doses of 225 mg or 675/225 mg, or placebo.RESULTS: The sample consisted of 133 patients, (67 fremanezumab and 66 placebo). Total reduction in migraine days for the duration of the study was 12.4 for fremanezumab and 7.4 for placebo (P = .0321). There were also decreases in moderate/severe headache days (12.5 vs 7.1, P = .0058), and days using acute medication for headaches relative to placebo (11.6 vs 7.5, P = .0414). Treatment emergent adverse events were generally mild and transient, and no serious adverse events were considered to be treatment-related by the site investigators.CONCLUSIONS: The findings from these post hoc analyses suggest that fremanezumab is a safe and effective add-on treatment for migraine patients being concomitantly treated with other migraine preventive medications.

The cardiotoxicity of antibodies has been associated to trastuzumab, a humanized anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody currently in clinical use for the therapy of breast carcinomas, which induces cardiac dysfunction when used in monotherapy, or in combination with anthracyclines.

Left ventricular end-diastolic and systolic volumes, LVEF, and global longitudinal strain (GLS) were examined. Development and reversibility of CT were defined based on changes in LVEF according to the 2014 ASE/EACVI recommendations. Cox analysis was used to determine the association of echocardiographic variables with the subsequent development and reversibility of CT. Ninety-five patients underwent 5 echocardiograms or more in a 17-month (13-28 months) follow-up period. Nineteen patients (20%) developed CT. Left ventricular volumes, LVEF, and GLS measured after AC completion identified the subsequent development of CT. Of the 19 patients with CT, the LVEF partially or fully recovered in 13 (68%).

We describe the patterns of cardiac monitoring and evaluate factors associated with adequate monitoring in a large population-based study of older patients with breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients age 66 years or older with full Medicare coverage, diagnosed with stage I to III breast cancer between 2005 and 2009, and treated with adjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy were identified in the SEER-Medicare and the Texas Cancer Registry-Medicare databases. The adequacy of cardiac monitoring was determined. Chemotherapy, trastuzumab use, cardiac monitoring, and comorbidities were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes. Prescribing physician characteristics were also evaluated. Analyses included descriptive statistics and multilevel logistic regression models.RESULTS: In all, 2,203 patients were identified; median age was 72 years. Adequate monitoring was identified in only 36.0% of the patients (n = 793). In the multivariable model, factors associated with optimal cardiac monitoring included a more recent year of diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.54), anthracycline use (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.71), female prescribing physician (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.70), and physician graduating after 1990 (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.12).

LVEF was determined at baseline and then 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment initiation. Cardiotoxicity was defined as ≥ 16% decrease in LVEF or ≥ 10% decrease in LVEF to <50%. There were no differences in comorbidities, earlier treatment, or demographics between patients with and without trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy except that African Americans were more likely to develop decreased LVEF (P < .05). Twenty-one patients (28%) met criteria for cardiotoxicity. Four of those patients were continued on trastuzumab and 17 patients had therapy withheld at some point. Only 1 patient developed symptomatic heart failure requiring inpatient hospitalization. LVEF improved in most patients regardless of whether or not trastuzumab was continued.CONCLUSIONS: Decreased LVEF while undergoing trastuzumab therapy occurs frequently and is usually reversible. African Americans had a higher risk of developing decreased LVEF. These findings raise clinically important questions as to whether it is necessary to discontinue trastuzumab for asymptomatic decrease in LVEF and whether African Americans are more predisposed to a decrease in LVEF while receiving trastuzumab.

The incidence of congestive heart failure in older patients treated with trastuzumab is expected to be higher than in the overall population evaluated in large clinical trials. Therefore, cardiac risk assessment, breast cancer recurrence risk, and discussion between cardiologists and oncologists should take place prior to deciding which adjuvant treatment is appropriate for a woman with early breast cancer. A longer follow-up period is recommended in order to verify whether cardiac reversibility remains and, accordingly, whether the short-term risk is exaggerated or understated. With the NSABP-B31 trial regimen, the benefit of trastuzumab definitely outweighs the risk; indeed, the occurrence of late congestive heart failure after adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy is fairly unusual. In the era of personalized medicine, efforts are needed to promote strategies for risk detection and management to avoid dangerous toxicities that may impede the development of and patient access to new agents."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab also differs from traditional chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in that it appears to be at least partially reversible, not related to the cumulative dose, and re-challenge is generally tolerated.", "answer_start": 1559}], "question": "Is trastuzumab associated cardiotoxicity reversible?", "id": "5a6f8dc6b750ff4455000058_016", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase HER2/ErbB2. This agent has shown a highly significant antitumour effect for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, and is now considered part of the standard regimens for the treatment of this disease in both the metastatic and adjuvant setting. Cardiotoxicity has been associated with trastuzumab, and this issue has now been studied and documented in a number of adjuvant trials for which data have now been released. Cardiotoxicity has been shown to be potentiated when the agent is used concurrently or sequentially with an anthracycline, and this has limited the use of trastuzumab in some patients. Determining the overall impact of trastuzumab is further complicated by the administration of other cardiotoxic agents such as the taxanes and cyclophosphamide as well as by pre-existing cardiac disease. The incidence of severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV) was 0-3.9% in the trastuzumab arms versus 0-1.3% in the control arms in the five major randomized adjuvant trials. Only one cardiac death was related to trastuzumab whereas two cardiac deaths occurred in the control arms. Ejection fraction decline of >or=10% or 15% was reported in 3-34% of trastuzumab recipients in these trials. Patients affected by trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity do not exhibit the cellular death and distinctive ultrastructural myocardial changes seen on electron microscopy with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. The cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab also differs from traditional chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in that it appears to be at least partially reversible, not related to the cumulative dose, and re-challenge is generally tolerated. There remain a number of uncertainties regarding the diagnosis and management of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. While no formal guidelines or consensus statements exist at present regarding cardiac monitoring during use of trastuzumab, proposed recommendations include a careful assessment of ejection fraction prior to initiating trastuzumab, avoidance of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with anthracyclines, and regular monitoring of symptoms and cardiac function during and for several years after therapy.

The BSG 98 pre-irradiation chemotherapy protocol showed a significant increase in overall survival.

We compared the group of patients who followed our BSG 98 protocol to those who were treated with new targeted therapy protocols where systematic biopsy was required.RESULTS: Patients in the BSG 98 protocol were treated with BCNU, cisplatin, and methotrexate, followed by radiation at disease progression. Targeted therapy protocols included radiation therapy along with treatment by erlotinib, cilengitide, or an association of nimotuzumab and vinblastine. Sixteen patients were treated with the BSG 98 protocol, and 9 patients were treated with new targeted therapy protocols. Median overall survival was significantly higher in the BSG 98 group compared to the targeted therapy group (16.1 months (95 % CI, 10.4-19.0) vs 8.8 months (95 % CI 1.4-12.3); p = 0.0003).

Two patients had rebound varus: one is being observed and another has undergone a repeat procedure.Patients with pathologic tibia vara present at various ages and have historically undergone various treatments ranging from bracing to tibial osteotomy based on age at presentation. We have found that guided growth utilizing tethering plates can be used effectively as first-line treatment in all patients with growth remaining. This minimally invasive method is predictable and well tolerated. Recurrent deformity, though unlikely, is easily remedied by repeating the process and does not preclude osteotomy if eventually needed.

The Multi-Axial Correction (MAC) monolateral external fixation system (Biomet, Parsippany, NJ, USA) is a non-circular fixator that was developed as a response to the technical difficulty for both patients and physicians of placing, managing, and tolerating a circular fixator. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of the MAC system for the treatment of pediatric patients with Blount's disease.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 17 consecutive patients with surgically corrected Blount's disease using the MAC system with tibial and fibular osteotomies was identified. Patient charts and radiographs at three different time points (pre-operative, fixator removal, and final follow-up) were reviewed. The mechanical axis deviation (MAD), tibial-femoral angle (TFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and posterior proximal tibial angle (PPTA) were measured in the MAC group at the three time points mentioned previously. The total wear time, total operative time, and post-operative complications were noted.RESULTS: The MAC system was able to correct the deformity of Blount's disease as measured by a decrease in the MAD (40.2 +/- 29.3 mm; P </= 0.001) and TFA (15.9 +/- 13.7 degrees ; P </= 0.001), as well as an increase in the MPTA (15.7 +/- 14.6 degrees ; P = 0.001) at the time of fixator removal. The correction was maintained for these parameters at the time of final follow-up (P </= 0.025). The absolute values obtained at final follow-up for MAD (20.5 +/- 12.7 mm medial), TFA (8.0 +/- 4.1 degrees varus), and MPTA (83.7 +/- 8.1 degrees ) after correction with the MAC system were close to what is considered as normal for these indices. The most common complications noted were superficial pin tract infections and/or cellulitis, with no patients having nerve palsy, compartment syndrome, non-union, or leg length discrepancies. The total time that the fixator was on the patients prior to removal was 130.6 days (standard deviation [SD] = 44.8). The mean operative time was 120.6 min (SD = 21.2).CONCLUSIONS: Correction of Blount's disease with osteotomy of the tibia and fibula as well as dynamic fixation with the MAC system achieved deformity correction as measured by radiographic indices with minimal intra- and post-operative complications.

This technique is based on correcting the mechanical axis of the lower limb thereby restoring growth from the medial physis of proximal tibia.

The exon skipping of DMD mRNA aims to restore the disrupted reading frame using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs), allowing the production of truncated but partly functional dystrophin proteins, and slow down the progression of the disease. This approach has also been explored in several other genetic disorders, including laminin α2 chain-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, dysferlin-deficient muscular dystrophy (e.g., Miyoshi myopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B), sarcoglycanopathy (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C), and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy. Antisense-mediated exon skipping is also a powerful tool to examine the function of genes and exons. A significant challenge in exon skipping is how to design effective AONs. The mechanism of mRNA splicing is highly complex with many factors involved. The selection of target sites, the length of AONs, the AON chemistry, and the melting temperature versus the RNA strand play important roles. A cocktail of AONs can be employed to skip multiples exons.

Historically, insomnia has been treated with agents such as benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists, and melatonin agonists.

This exposure to estrogen results in increased risk of breast cancer. The first patient described is a male-to-female transsexual with screening-detected ductal carcinoma in situ and a family history of breast cancer. The other patient is a male-to-female transsexual with invasive ductal carcinoma that was occult on diagnostic digital mammographic and ultrasound findings but visualized on digital breast tomosynthesis and breast MR images. The analysis of the eight previously reported cases showed that breast cancer in male-to-female transsexuals occurs at a younger age and is more frequently estrogen receptor negative than breast cancer in others born biologically male.

Although genetic factors are involved, less is known regarding the role of anthropometric and hormonally related risk factors.METHODS: In the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project, a consortium of 11 case-control and 10 cohort investigations involving 2405 case patients (n = 1190 from case-control and n = 1215 from cohort studies) and 52013 control subjects, individual participant data were harmonized and pooled. Unconditional logistic regression generated study design-specific (case-control/cohort) odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with exposure estimates combined using fixed effects meta-analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: Risk was statistically significantly associated with weight (highest/lowest tertile: OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.57), height (OR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.38), and body mass index (BMI; OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.51), with evidence that recent rather than distant BMI was the strongest predictor. Klinefelter syndrome (OR = 24.7; 95% CI = 8.94 to 68.4) and gynecomastia (OR = 9.78; 95% CI = 7.52 to 12.7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI. Diabetes also emerged as an independent risk factor (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.37). There were also suggestive relations with cryptorchidism (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 0.96 to 4.94) and orchitis (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.99). Although age at onset of puberty and histories of infertility were unrelated to risk, never having had children was statistically significantly related (OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.66). Among individuals diagnosed at older ages, a history of fractures was statistically significantly related (OR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.86).CONCLUSIONS: Consistent findings across case-control and cohort investigations, complemented by pooled analyses, indicated important roles for anthropometric and hormonal risk factors in the etiology of male breast cancer.

The long-term inflammatory and metabolic dysfunction associated with MetS may contribute to osteoarthritic processes leading up to total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The purpose of this study was to investigate levels of metabolic biomarkers and the prevalence of MetS in patients undergoing TJA.METHODS: Under IRB approval, citrated plasma samples were collected from 41 patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA) preoperatively and day 1 postoperatively. Control group consisted of 25 healthy human plasma samples (female and male, 18-35 years old) purchased from George King Biomedical Inc. (Overland Park, KS, USA). Samples were profiled for c-peptide, ferritin, IL-6, insulin, resistin, TNF-α, IL-1a, leptin, and PAI-1 using metabolic biochips purchased from RANDOX Co. (Antrim, Northern Ireland). NCEP/ATP III guidelines were used to evaluate which patients met MetS criteria.RESULTS: Levels of IL-6, resistin, TNF-a, IL-1a, leptin, and PAI-1 were significantly elevated in patients undergoing TJA compared to normal. C-peptide and insulin were both decreased in TJA compared to normal. No significance was found when comparing TJA to normal for ferritin. TNFα was significantly lower in TJA+MetS compared to TJA-MetS, while other biomarkers showed no difference in TJA±MetS populations. Insulin & c-peptide both showed a significant decrease in TJA-MetS compared to normal, but levels in TJA+MetS patients were not significantly different from controls. Resistin showed significant increases in TJA+MetS vs. normal, but not in TJA-MetS vs. normal.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the differing metabolic profile seen in patients undergoing TJA suggest ongoing metabolic dysfunction. Insulin and c-peptide patterns among the different test groups hint toward a complex and dysfunctional metabolic process involved, with leptin and underlying insulin resistance playing a role. Increased resistin in TJA+MetS, but not in TJA-MetS, compared to normal, suggests that while elevated resistin levels may be associated with the osteoarthritic process, levels are further attenuated by MetS, which is highly prevalent in this population. Increased TNFα in TJA-MetS compared to TJA+MetS may be an artifact of differing sample populations or a true complication of the complex pathophysiology and medical regimen seen in patients with both OA and MetS. The lack of difference seen in the remaining biomarkers suggest that having MetS as a comorbidity does not contribute to the elevated levels seen in patients undergoing TJA."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is generally defined as a cluster of metabolically related cardiovascular risk factors which are often associated with the condition of insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, and abdominal obesity", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "According to guidelines, insulin resistance is one risk factor in the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, name 3 more risk factors.", "id": "5a981e66fcd1d6a10c00002f_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is generally defined as a cluster of metabolically related cardiovascular risk factors which are often associated with the condition of insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, and abdominal obesity.

Insulin resistance is also associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes which is strongly associated with obesity. The insulin resistance of obese people and subjects with type 2 diabetes is characterised by defects at many levels, affecting insulin receptor concentration, glucose transport mechanisms and the activities of intracellular enzymes. Around 25% of western populations show some features of the insulin resistance syndrome (often referred to as syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome) ie, a clustering of metabolic, atheromatous risk factors, including hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, hyper-tension, hypercholesterinaemia and obesity. However, the known metabolic cardiovascular risk factors associated with the insulin resistance syndrome do not sufficiently explain the excess vascular risk attributed to this syndrome. The observation, that increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels were associated with insulin resistance and atherothrombosis added for the first time a pathological basis for an association of the insulin resistance syndrome not only with metabolic, atheromatous (atherosclerotic) risk but also with atherothrombotic risk. It is very likely that not only PAI-1, but also other abnormalities in haemostatic variables contribute to this excess vascular risk. Knowledge of how haemostatic variables cluster with classical metabolic risk factors associated with the insulin resistance syndrome could help to better understand the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, many coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins have been shown to be associated with features of the insulin resistance syndrome and these associations suggest that some coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins have a role in atherothrombotic disorders, principally through an association with other established metabolic (atheromatous) risk factors in the presence of underlying insulin resistance. Interestingly, new therapeutic approaches in the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance do show some influence on coagulation and fibrinolysis.

Several approaches have been used, including therapeutic vaccines, monoclonal antibodies; checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T cell transfer. Most of these therapies are still in early-phase testing (phase I and II) for ovarian cancer, but the initial data in ovarian cancer and successful use in other types of cancers suggests some of these approaches may ultimately prove useful for ovarian cancer as well. Ovarian cancer vaccines have shown only a modest benefit in ovarian cancer when used as monotherapy, but these agents may be able to enhance antitumor activity when combined with chemotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, or other immunotherapies. Monoclonal antibodies have been explored in ovarian cancer but despite encouraging phase II data, randomized studies failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefit. Check point inhibitors have promising activity in several solid tumors and have demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile. Data from early clinical trials utilizing PD1 and PD-L1 inhibitors showed encouraging results.

Immunotherapy remains investigational in ovarian cancer and the benefit of this approach in improving progression-free survival (PFS) or OS is unknown.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from carcinoids of intestinal origin.METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and determine BLP levels in these tumors.RESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels.CONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels.

However, the molecular basis of this property is unclear and is the subject of this study. To accomplish this, site-directed mutagenesis was used after identifying potentially important amino acids using sequence homology analysis of all BnRs with high affinity for Univ.Lig compared to the Cholecystokinin-receptor (CCK(A)R), which has low affinity. Using various criteria 74 amino acids were identified and 101 mutations made in GRPR by changing each to those of CCK(A)R or to alanine. 22 GRPR mutations showed a significant decrease in affinity for Univ.Lig (>2-fold) with 2 in EC2[D97N, G112V], 1 in UTM6[Y284A], 2 in EC4[R287N, H300S] showing >10-fold decrease in Univ.Lig affinity.

Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14 of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium. Using either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and GRP were found to be mitogens for three NSCLC cell lines that express mRNA for BLP receptors and secrete BLPs, regardless of which peptide and/or receptor subtype was detected. The monoclonal antibody 2A11, which preferentially recognizes GRP, was able to block the in vitro proliferative response to GRP in the BrDU incorporation assay, and partially blocked the response to NMB. The 2A11 antibody could only partially block the in vivo growth of cell lines that showed proliferative responses to BLPs. 2A11 antibody was more effective against the 239T cell line, which secreted a low amount of GRP into the medium (0.6 nM), compared to the 201T cell line, which secreted a higher amount of both GRP and NMB (4.2 nM and 36.6 nM, respectively). These results suggest that both NMB and GRP are autocrine growth factors for NSCLC, but that the production of NMB and expression of the NMBR may be more prominent than the production of GRP and expression of the GRP receptor.

In patients with sulfa allergies, dapsone prophylaxis is often used due to its efficacy, long half-life, cost effectiveness, and general safety at low doses. However, dapsone may uncommonly induce a hemolytic anemia, particularly in patients deficient of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This hemolysis is thought to be a result of oxidative stress on red blood cells induced by dapsone metabolites which produce reactive oxygen species that disrupt the red blood cell membrane and promote splenic sequestration. A single case report of dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia in a patient with glioblastoma multiforme has been reported. We present two patients with glioblastoma multiforme who developed severe hemolytic anemia shortly after initiating therapy with vorinostat, a pan-active histone deacetylase inhibitor, while on prophylactic dapsone. There are several potential mechanisms by which histone deacetylase inhibition may alter dapsone metabolism including changes in hepatic acetylation or N-glucuronidation leading to an increase in the bioavailability of dapsone's hematotoxic metabolites. In addition, vorinostat may lead to increased hemolysis through inhibition of heat shock protein-90, a chaperone protein that maintains the integrity of the red blood cell membrane cytoskeleton. The potential interaction between dapsone and vorinostat may have important clinical implications as more than 10 clinical trials evaluating drug combinations with vorinostat in patients with malignant glioma are either ongoing or planned in North America."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Vorinostat is the most advanced HDAC inhibitor that entered clinical trials in glioblastoma, showing activity in recurrent disease.

Enzymatic modifications of histone proteins regulating gene expression are being exploited for therapeutic drug targeting. Over the last decade, numerous studies have shown promising results with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in various malignancies. This article provides a brief overview of mechanism of anti-cancer effect and pharmacology of HDAC inhibitors and summarizes results from pre-clinical and clinical studies in glioblastoma. It analyses experience with HDAC inhibitors as single agents as well as in combination with targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Hallmark features of glioblastoma, such as uncontrolled cellular proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis, have been shown to be targeted by HDAC inhibitors in experiments with glioblastoma cell lines. Vorinostat is the most advanced HDAC inhibitor that entered clinical trials in glioblastoma, showing activity in recurrent disease. Multiple phase II trials with vorinostat in combination with targeted agents, temozolomide and radiotherapy are currently recruiting. While the results from pre-clinical studies are encouraging, early clinical trials showed only modest benefit and the value of HDAC inhibitors for clinical practice will need to be confirmed in larger prospective trials. Further research in epigenetic mechanisms driving glioblastoma pathogenesis and identification of molecular subtypes of glioblastoma is needed.

Part 1 was a dose-escalation study of vorinostat in combination with TMZ 150 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days every 28 days. Part 2 was a dose-escalation study of vorinostat in combination with TMZ 150 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days of the first cycle and 200 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days of the subsequent 28-day cycles.RESULTS: In part 1, the MTD of vorinostat administered on days 1 to 7 and 15 to 21 of every 28-day cycle, in combination with TMZ, was 500 mg daily.

We show that libgapmis is better-suited and more efficient than existing algorithms for this task. The importance of our contribution is underlined by the fact that the provided functions may be seamlessly integrated into any short-read alignment pipeline.

In molecular level, we identified S100P as a crucial downstream effector of BCL10-inhibited OSCC progression by high-throughput microarray analysis.

Furthermore, we provided evidence that BCL10 regulated S100P expression through signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Knockdown of BCL10 decreased S100P promoter activity, but showed no effect in truncated STAT1/ATF4 S100P promoter.  In addition, we also found that the P50/P65 signaling pathway was involved in BCL10-enhanced OSCC progression.

On the contrary, during conditions of prolonged ER stress, pro-adaptive responses fail and apoptotic cell death ensues. Interestingly, similar to the activity of the mitochondria, the ER may also directly activate the apoptotic pathway through ER stress-mediated leakage of calcium into the cytoplasm that leads to the activation of death effectors. Apoptotic cell death also ensues by ATF4-CHOP- mediated induction of several pro-apoptotic genes and suppression of the synthesis of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Advancing molecular insight into the transition of tumor cells from adaptation to apoptosis under hypoxia-induced ER stress may provide answers on how to overcome the limitations of current anti-tumor therapies.

According to the recent classification of lymphomas, most lymphomas developing in patients with Sjögren's syndrome are B lymphomas of the marginal zone: MALT lymphomas or low-grade nodal monocytoid lymphomas which are sometimes not identified until transformation to the giant cell stage.SIMILARITIES WITH HEPATITIS C LYMPHOMAS: The pathophysiology of lymphoma in Sjögrën's syndrome remains unknown. To date, there is no argument favoring a viral infection or a deregulation of a unique oncogene or anti-oncogene. Certain similarities between lymphomas in Sjögren's syndrome and lymphomas associated with hepatitic C virus would suggest a common pathogenisis: possibly a permanent stimulation of auto-reactive B cells carrying a surface immunoglobulin with rheumatoid factor activity in the target organs of the autoimmune disease.

Reassessment and direct questioning revealed long-standing sexual dysfunction. It was also discovered that our patient had fractured his radius twice, with minor trauma, during the preceding year. His serum prolactin was massively increased and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head demonstrated a pituitary mass consistent with a prolactinoma. Dual X-ray absorptiometry revealed osteoporosis. Treatment of the prolactinoma led to a reduction in his serum prolactin with a rise in his haemoglobin to normal levels.

In one, mild hyperprolactinemia was produced in rats bearing extra anterior pituitary glands under the kidney capsule. Severe hyperprolactinemia was produced by subcutaneously transplanting the PRL-secreting MMQ tumor into other rats. To control for estrogen deficiency, the rats were ovariectomized. In some experiments, estrogen replacement was provided. Urinary calcium excretion was increased in hyperprolactinemic rats compared with controls, regardless of severity of PRL excess and estrogen status. This suggested that PRL excess itself had some effect on calcium balance.

However, knowledge of chronological events in prion spread during early infection remains incomplete. To investigate this knowledge gap in early CWD pathogenesis, we exposed white-tailed deer to CWD prions by mucosal routes and performed serial necropsies to assess PrPCWD tissue distribution by real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and tyramide signal amplification immunohistochemistry (TSA-IHC). Although PrPCWD was not detected by either method in the initial days (1 and 3) postexposure, we observed PrPCWD seeding activity and follicular immunoreactivity in oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues at 1 and 2 months postexposure (MPE). At 3 MPE, PrPCWD replication had expanded to all systemic lymphoid tissues. By 4 MPE, the PrPCWD burden in all lymphoid tissues had increased and approached levels observed in terminal disease, yet there was no evidence of nervous system invasion. These results indicate the first site of CWD prion entry is in the oropharynx, and the initial phase of prion amplification occurs in the oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues followed by rapid dissemination to systemic lymphoid tissues. This lymphoid replication phase appears to precede neuroinvasion.IMPORTANCE Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a universally fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting cervids, and natural infection occurs through oral and nasal mucosal exposure to infectious prions. Terminal disease is characterized by PrPCWD accumulation in the brain and lymphoid tissues of affected animals. However, the initial sites of prion accumulation and pathways of prion spread during early CWD infection remain unknown. To investigate the chronological events of early prion pathogenesis, we exposed deer to CWD prions and monitored the tissue distribution of PrPCWD over the first 4 months of infection. We show CWD uptake occurs in the oropharynx with initial prion replication in the draining oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues, rapidly followed by dissemination to systemic lymphoid tissues without evidence of neuroinvasion.

Chronic wasting disease is laterally transmitted and environmental contamination may play an important role in local maintenance of the disease. Studies on the epidemiology of CWD have led to the development of models to help explain the history of CWD and to simulate future impacts on deer and elk populations. Diagnostic tests have been improved, allowing diagnosis early in the incubation period, long before the appearance of clinical disease. Surveillance techniques and programmes have been developed and instituted by wildlife management agencies for free-ranging deer and elk and by state and federal agricultural agencies for privately-owned elk.

The natural history of CWD is incompletely understood, but it differs from scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) by virtue of its occurrence in nondomestic and free-ranging species. CWD has many features in common with scrapie, including early widespread distribution of disease-associated prion protein (PrP(d)) in lymphoid tissues, with later involvement of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues. This distribution likely contributes to apparent efficiency of horizontal transmission and, in this, is similar to scrapie and differs from BSE. Clinical features and lesions of CWD are qualitatively similar to the other animal TSEs. Microscopically, marked spongiform lesions occur in the central nervous system (CNS) after a prolonged incubation period and variable course of clinical disease. During incubation, PrP(d) can be identified in tissues by antibody-based detection systems. Although CWD can be transmitted by intracerebral inoculation to cattle, sheep, and goats, ongoing studies have not demonstrated that domestic livestock are susceptible via oral exposure, the presumed natural route of exposure to TSEs. Surveillance efforts for CWD in captive and free-ranging cervids will continue in concert with similar activities for scrapie and BSE.

CWD is the only recognized transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting free-ranging species. Three cervid species, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), are the only known natural hosts of CWD. Endemic CWD is well established in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado, and has been present in this 'core area' for two decades or more. Apparently CWD has also infected farmed cervids in numerous jurisdictions, and has probably been endemic in North America's farmed deer and elk for well over a decade. Several free-ranging foci distant to the Colorado-Wyoming core area have been discovered since 2000, and new or intensified surveillance may well identify even more foci of infection. Whether all of the identified captive and free-ranging foci are connected via a common original exposure source remains undetermined. Some of this recently observed 'spread' may be attributable to improved detection or natural movements of infected deer and elk, but more distant range extensions are more likely caused by movements of infected captive deer and elk in commerce, or by some yet unidentified exposure risk factor. Research on CWD over the last 5 years has resulted in a more complete understanding of its pathogenesis and epidemiology. CWD is infectious, transmitting horizontally from infected to susceptible cervids. Early accumulation of PrP(CWD) in alimentary tract-associated lymphoid tissues during incubation suggests agent shedding in feces or saliva as plausible transmission routes. Residual infectivity in contaminated environments also appears to be important in sustaining epidemics. Improved tests allow CWD to be reliably diagnosed long before clinical signs appear. Implications of CWD are not entirely clear at this time. Natural transmission to humans or traditional domestic livestock seems relatively unlikely, but the possibility still evokes public concerns; impacts on wildlife resources have not been determined. Consequently, where CWD is not known to occur surveillance programs and regulations that prevent or reduce the likelihood that CWD will be introduced into these jurisdictions should be encouraged. Where CWD is known to occur, affected jurisdictions are conducting surveillance to estimate and monitor trends in geographic distribution and prevalence, managing deer and elk populations in attempts to limit spread, and developing and evaluating techniques for further controlling and perhaps eradicating CWD. Programs for addressing the challenges of CWD management will require interagency cooperation, commitment of funds and personnel, and applied research. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is perhaps the most enigmatic of the naturally occurring prion diseases. Although recognized as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) since the late 1970s (Williams and Young 1980, 1982), interest in and concern about CWD has only recently emerged. CWD most closely resembles scrapie in sheep in most respects, but recent media and public reaction to CWD has been more reminiscent of that afforded to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) less than a decade ago. Yet, with the exception of transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), CWD is the rarest of the known animal TSEs: fewer than 1,000 cases have been diagnosed worldwide, and all but two of these occurred in North America. CWD is unique among the TSEs in that it affects free-living species (Spraker et al. 1997; Miller et al. 2000). The three natural host species for CWD, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), are all in the family Cervidae and native to North America. Like scrapie, CWD is contagious: epidemics are self-sustaining in both captive and free-ranging cervid populations (Miller et al. 1998, 2000). The geographic extent of endemic CWD in free-ranging wildlife was initially thought to be quite limited and its natural rate of expansion slow; however, recent investigations have revealed that CWD has been inadvertently spread much more widely via market-driven movements of infected, farmed elk and deer. Both the ecological and economic consequences of CWD and its spread remain to be determined; moreover, public health implications remain a question of intense interest. Here, we review current understanding of CWD, its implications, and its management."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Glycated proteins, such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or glycated albumin (GA) in the blood, are essential indicators of glycemic control for diabetes mellitus.

We used fructosyl amino acid oxidase, hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride as the electron mediator, and an inexpensive and economically attractive screen-printed carbon electrode. We used chronoamperometry to measure protease-digested GA samples. The developed sensor strips were able to measure protease-digested samples containing GA in very small sample volumes (1.3μL) within about 1min. We also prepared enzyme sensor strips suitable for clinical use in which the enzyme and the mediator were deposited and dried on. This sensor system showed a clear correlation between the GA concentration and the resulting current. The strips were stable following 3 months of storage at 37°C.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been used by clinicians as a means to measure short to intermediate term glucose control in diabetics. Trials evaluating tight glucose control using HbA1c measurements have recently been conducted for several medical conditions. The goal of this study is to determine if the level of hemoglobin A1c has any effect on disease severity in diabetic patients with limb threatening ischemia.METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients presenting with limb threatening ischemia between January 1 and December 31, 2007 was conducted. All patients underwent conventional arteriography prior to intervention. Of 148 patients, 73 were diabetics with a hemoglobin A1c level performed within 3 mo of presentation. Patients were placed into high (>7) and low (<7) hemoglobin A1c groups and data was collected on type of presentation, comorbidities, anatomic level of disease, tibial artery patency, need for amputation, contralateral disease, need for an open versus an endovascular procedure, and freedom from intervention. Fisher's exact t-test was used to compare the two groups. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: Thirty-six patients had HbA1c levels above 7.0 and 37 had levels below 7.0 (mean 7.64 ± 2.04, range 5.1-14.7). There were no statistically significant differences in the two groups in comorbities, average age, initial gangrene at presentation, aspirin or statin use, or smoking status. Patients in the high group were more likely to have had a previous attempt at revascularization (23 versus 11, P = 0.0049). There was no difference in the presence of contralateral disease (7 versus 4, P = 0.3447) or in the number of patent tibial vessels. Patients with low HbA1c levels were more likely to have the peroneal artery affected (17 versus 8, P = 0.048). In addition, TASC II classifications of iliac and femoral popliteal disease was similar between the two groups. Freedom from intervention is depicted graphically by life table analysis.CONCLUSION: Glucose control measured by hemoglobin A1c does not appear to affect severity of disease or need for reintervention in diabetics with limb threatening ischemia. This suggests other factors related to diabetes may play a role in peripheral vascular disease. Larger, prospective studies are needed to assess the affect of glucose control in limb threatening ischemia.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Ts65Dn mice and disomic (2N) littermates sacrificed at ages 6-8 and 14-18 mos were used for an aging study and Ts65Dn and 2N mice derived from Ts65Dn dams were maintained on either a choline-supplemented or a choline-controlled diet (conception to weaning) and examined at 14-18 mos for MCS studies. In the latter, mice were behaviorally tested on the radial arm Morris water maze (RAWM) and hippocampal tissue was examined for intensity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity. Hippocampal ChAT activity was evaluated in a separate cohort. ChAT-positive fiber innervation was significantly higher in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus in Ts65Dn mice compared with 2N mice, independent of age or maternal diet. Similarly, hippocampal ChAT activity was significantly elevated in Ts65Dn mice compared to 2N mice, independent of maternal diet. A significant increase with age was seen in hippocampal cholinergic innervation of 2N mice, but not Ts65Dn mice. Degree of ChAT intensity correlated negatively with spatial memory ability in unsupplemented 2N and Ts65Dn mice, but positively in MCS 2N mice. The increased innervation produced by MCS appears to improve hippocampal function, making this a therapy that may be exploited for future translational approaches in human DS."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder resulting from the presence of all or part of an extra Chromosome 21.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Down's syndrome occurs when an individual has an extra copy or part of a copy of chromosome 21, yes or no?", "id": "5a76016683b0d9ea6600000d_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder resulting from the presence of all or part of an extra Chromosome 21.

The diagnosis was based on histologic examination of the surgically resected tumor. Postoperatively, the patient's neurologic status improved, and there was no tumor regrowth in the next 2 years. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosome 22 confirmed high allele loss involving the neurofibromin 2 gene locus, a finding typical in meningiomas. Fluorescence in situ hybridization also revealed chromosome 21 heterogeneity in tumor cells; not only cells with trisomy 21 but also cells with disomy and monosomy 21 were present. All blood cells from the patient manifested trisomy 21.CONCLUSIONS: Deletion of the chromosome 21 allele may be associated with tumorigenesis of meningioma in Down syndrome.

It is well known that in the outstanding majority of cases the extra chromosome 21 originates from the mother but only in less than 10 % from the father. The mechanism underlying this striking difference in parental origin of Trisomy 21 Down syndrome is still unknown. However, it seems likely that the main reason is a much higher stringency in the elimination of any trisomy 21 cells during fetal testicular than ovarian development. We have here focussed attention on the paternal gametic output, i.e. the incidence of disomy 21 in spermatozoa.RESULTS: We have used fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to determine the copy number of chromosome 21 in spermatozoa from 11 men with normal spermiograms. Due to the well-known risk of false positive and false negative signals using a single FISH probe, we have applied two chromosome 21q probes, and we have added a chromosome 18-specific probe to allow differentiation between disomy 21 and diploidy. Analysing a total number of 2000 spermatozoa per case, we documented an average incidence of disomy 21 at 0.13 %, with a range of 0.00-0.25 % and a SD of 0.08. There was no indication of diploidy in this cohort of 22,000 sperm.CONCLUSION: Numerous previous studies on the incidence of disomy 21 in sperm have been published, using FISH. As far as we are aware, none of these have applied more than a single chromosome 21-specific probe. Accepting our mean of 0.13 % of disomy 21, and providing there is no selective fertilisation capability of disomy 21 sperm in relation to the normal, we conclude that around 1 in 800 conceptions is expected to be trisomic for chromosome 21 of paternal origin. Bearing in mind that the maternal origin likely is at least 10 times more common, we tentatively propose that around 1 in 80 oocytes in the maternal ovarian reserve may be disomy 21.

It is well known that the extra chromosome 21 most often originates from the mother, the incidence increases with maternal age, there may be aberrant maternal chromosome 21 recombination and there is a higher recurrence in young women. In spite of intensive efforts to understand the underlying reason(s) for these characteristics, the origin still remains unknown. We hypothesize that maternal trisomy 21 ovarian mosaicism might provide the major causative factor.RESULTS: We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with two chromosome 21-specific probes to determine the copy number of chromosome 21 in ovarian cells from eight female foetuses at gestational age 14-22 weeks. All eight phenotypically normal female foetuses were found to be mosaics, containing ovarian cells with an extra chromosome 21. Trisomy 21 occurred with about the same frequency in cells that had entered meiosis as in pre-meiotic and ovarian mesenchymal stroma cells.CONCLUSION: We suggest that most normal female foetuses are trisomy 21 ovarian mosaics and the maternal age effect is caused by differential selection of these cells during foetal and postnatal development until ovulation. The exceptional occurrence of high-grade ovarian mosaicism may explain why some women have a child with Down syndrome already at young age as well as the associated increased incidence at subsequent conceptions. We also propose that our findings may explain the aberrant maternal recombination patterns previously found by family linkage analysis."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Craniosynostosis has its origin in the failure of suture development between 2 bone centres or in early closure of the suture by bone centre tissue fusion.

We have previously demonstrated that physiological closure of the posterior frontal suture occurs through endochondral ossification.

Classic Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is characterized by coronal synostosis, and the haploinsufficient Twist1(+/-) mice represents a suitable model for studying this syndrome. Thus, we seeked to understand the underlying ossification process in coronal craniosynostosis in Twist1(+/-) mice. Our data indicate that coronal suture closure in Twist1(+/-) mice occurs between postnatal day 9 and 13 by endochondral ossification, as shown by histology, gene expression analysis, and immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, this study reveals that coronal craniosynostosis in Twist1(+/-) mice occurs through endochondral ossification.

This may affect the overall estimation of disease activity, especially because headaches are common among children with SLE and narcotic analgesia is rarely used for headache therapy in paediatrics. Moreover, the importance of headaches for the development of damage and their relation to other clinical parameters and outcomes has not been well described for children with SLE.

Lupus Foundation of America (LFA)-Rapid Evaluation of Activity in Lupus (REAL) is a pilot application composed of anchored visual analogue scores (0-100 mm each) for each organ affected by lupus. This study evaluated the use of LFA-REAL in capturing SLE disease activity.METHODS: In a preliminary test of LFA-REAL, this simplified, organ-based system was compared with the most widely used outcome measures in clinical trials, the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 Index (BILAG), the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) SLEDAI Physician's Global Assessment (SS-PGA). The level of agreement was analysed using Spearman rank correlations.RESULTS: 91 patients with SLE with mild to severe disease activity were evaluated, their median SLEDAI score was 4.0 (range 0-28) and BILAG score 8.0 (0-32). The median SS-PGA was 38 mm (4-92) versus the total REAL 50 mm (0-268), which expands in range by additive organ scores. Thirty-three patients had moderate to severe disease activity (≥1.5 on SS-PGA landmarks). The median SS-PGA score of this group was 66 mm (50-92) versus median REAL score of 100 mm (59-268), confirming ability to detect a wider distribution of scores at higher disease activity. Total REAL correlated with SLEDAI, BILAG and SS-PGA (correlation coefficient=0.816, 0.933 and 0.903, respectively; p<0.001 for all). Individual LFA-REAL organ scores for musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous also correlated with corresponding BILAG domain scores (correlation coefficient=0.925 and 0.934, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary exercise, there were strong correlations between LFA-REAL and validated lupus disease activity indices.

We describe the clinical features of two patients with this double anomaly.CASE REPORTS: A 62-year-old Caucasian non-smoking woman was diagnosed with cT4N0M0 lung adenocarcinoma. Initial biopsy showed EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement. She received cisplatin-gemcitabine, followed by 17 months of gemcitabine. Owing to progression, she received erlotinib for 14 months, then paclitaxel for 6 months and finally crizotinib. A partial response was achieved and maintained for 24 months. A 45-year-old Caucasian woman, light smoker, was diagnosed with cT2N3M0 lung adenocarcinoma. Only EGFR mutation was found on initial analysis. She underwent treatment with cisplatin-gemcitabine and thoracic radiotherapy. Progression occurred after 8 months and afatinbib was started. Eight months later, progression was observed with a neoplasic pleural effusion in which tumor cells expressing ALK rearrangement were found. A new FISH analysis was performed on the initial tumor but did not find this rearrangement. Despite a third line of crizotinib, the patient died one month later.DISCUSSION: The literature shows 45 other cases of these two abnormalities, observed either from the start or during follow-up. EGFR's TKI were almost always given before ALK's TKI.CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic strategy needs to be clarified in cases of double alteration.

As systemic therapies improve, patients with lung cancer live longer and thus are at increased risk for brain metastases. Understanding how prognosis varies across this heterogeneous patient population is essential to individualize care and design future clinical trials.Objective: To update the current Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. The DS-GPA is based on data from patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2005, and we set out to update it by incorporating more recently reported gene and molecular alteration data for patients with NSCLC and brain metastases. This new index is called the Lung-molGPA.Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a multi-institutional retrospective database analysis of 2186 patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2014 with NSCLC and newly diagnosed brain metastases. The multivariable analyses took place between December 2015 and May 2016, and all prognostic factors were weighted for significance by hazard ratios. Significant factors were included in the updated Lung-molGPA prognostic index.Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was survival. Multiple Cox regression was used to select and weight prognostic factors in proportion to their hazard ratios. Log rank tests were used to compare adjacent classes and to compare overall survival for adenocarcinoma vs nonadenocarcinoma groups.Results: The original DS-GPA was based on 4 factors found in 1833 patients with NSCLC and brain metastases diagnosed between 1985 and 2005: patient age, Karnofsky Performance Status, extracranial metastases, and number of brain metastases. The patients studied for the creation of the DS-GPA had a median survival of 7 months from the time of initial treatment of brain metastases. To design the updated Lung-molGPA, we analyzed data from 2186 patients from 2006 through 2014 with NSCLC and newly diagnosed brain metastases (1521 adenocarcinoma and 665 nonadenocarcinoma). Significant prognostic factors included the original 4 factors used in the DS-GPA index plus 2 new factors: EGFR and ALK alterations in patients with adenocarcinoma (mutation status was not routinely tested for nonadenocarcinoma). The overall median survival for the cohort in the present study was 12 months, and those with NSCLC-adenocarcinoma and Lung-molGPA scores of 3.5 to 4.0 had a median survival of nearly 4 years.Conclusions and Relevance: In recent years, patient survival and physicians' ability to predict survival in NSCLC with brain metastases has improved significantly. The updated Lung-molGPA incorporating gene alteration data into the DS-GPA is a user-friendly tool that may facilitate clinical decision making and appropriate stratification of future clinical trials."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "investigational ALK inhibitor brigatinib is active in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.", "answer_start": 50}], "question": "What disease is the ALK tyrosine kinase associated with?", "id": "5a871a6861bb38fb24000009_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Results from a phase I/II trial indicate that the investigational ALK inhibitor brigatinib is active in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.

We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase.METHODS: After screening tumor samples from approximately 1500 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer for the presence of ALK rearrangements, we identified 82 patients with advanced ALK-positive disease who were eligible for the clinical trial. Most of the patients had received previous treatment. These patients were enrolled in an expanded cohort study instituted after phase 1 dose escalation had established a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Patients were assessed for adverse events and response to therapy.RESULTS: Patients with ALK rearrangements tended to be younger than those without the rearrangements, and most of the patients had little or no exposure to tobacco and had adenocarcinomas. At a mean treatment duration of 6.4 months, the overall response rate was 57% (47 of 82 patients, with 46 confirmed partial responses and 1 confirmed complete response); 27 patients (33%) had stable disease. A total of 63 of 82 patients (77%) were continuing to receive crizotinib at the time of data cutoff, and the estimated probability of 6-month progression-free survival was 72%, with no median for the study reached.

The native ALK protein is normally expressed in the developing and, at a weaker level, adult nervous system. We recently demonstrated that ALK is a novel dependence receptor. As such, in the absence of ligand, the ALK receptor is kinase inactive and its expression results in enhanced apoptosis, whereas kinase activation, due to a ligand or constitutive as in NPM-ALK, decreases apoptosis. Unligated/kinase unactivated ALK receptor facilitates apoptosis via its own cleavage by caspases, a phenomenon allowing the exposure of a proapoptotic juxta-membrane intra-cellular domain. This review summarizes the biological significance of the ALK receptor in cancer and development, in perspective with its dependence receptor function. The dual function of ALK in the physiology of development is illustrated in the visual system of Drosophila. In this part of the nervous system, ALK in the presence of ligand appears essential for axonal guidance, whereas in the absence of ligand, ALK expression can lead to developmental neuronal apoptosis. ALK is also found expressed in neural crest-derived tumors such as human neuroblastomas or glioblastomas but its role is not fully elucidated. However, an excessive or constitutive ALK tyrosine kinase activation can lead to deregulation of cell proliferation and survival, therefore to human cancers such as lymphomas and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors.

These translocations generate fusion proteins (e.g. NPM-ALK) with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, which activate numerous signalling pathways important for ALK+ ALCL pathogenesis. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) plays a critical role in allowing NPM-ALK and other signalling proteins to function in this lymphoma. Co-chaperone proteins are important for helping Hsp90 fold proteins and for directing Hsp90 to specific clients; however the importance of co-chaperone proteins in ALK+ ALCL has not been investigated. Our preliminary findings suggested that expression of the immunophilin co-chaperone, Cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40), is up-regulated in ALK+ ALCL by JunB, a transcription factor activated by NPM-ALK signalling. In this study we examined the regulation of the immunophilin family of co-chaperones by NPM-ALK and JunB, and investigated whether the immunophilin co-chaperones promote the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines.METHODS: NPM-ALK and JunB were knocked-down in ALK+ ALCL cell lines with siRNA, and the effect on the expression of the three immunophilin co-chaperones: Cyp40, FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 51, and FKBP52 examined. Furthermore, the effect of knock-down of the immunophilin co-chaperones, either individually or in combination, on the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines and NPM-ALK levels and activity was also examined.RESULTS: We found that NPM-ALK promoted the transcription of Cyp40 and FKBP52, but only Cyp40 transcription was promoted by JunB. We also observed reduced viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines treated with Cyp40 siRNA, but not with siRNAs directed against FKBP52 or FKBP51. Finally, we demonstrate that the decrease in the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines treated with Cyp40 siRNA does not appear to be due to a decrease in NPM-ALK levels or the ability of this oncoprotein to signal.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating that the expression of immunophilin family co-chaperones is promoted by an oncogenic tyrosine kinase.

Because kinases are typically regulated by autophosphorylation of their activation loops, we systematically mutated (Tyr --> Phe) three potential autophosphorylation sites contained in the \"YXXXYY\" motif of the ALK activation loop, and determined the effect of these mutations on the catalytic activity and biological function of NPM/ALK. We observed that mutation of both the second and third tyrosine residues (YFF mutant) did not affect the kinase activity or transforming ability of NPM/ALK. In contrast, mutation of the first and second (FFY), first and third (FYF), or all three (FFF) tyrosine residues impaired both kinase activity and transforming ability of NPM/ALK. Furthermore, a DFF mutant, in which the aspartic residue introduces a negative charge similar to a phosphorylated tyrosine, possessed catalytic activity similar to the YFF mutant.

Although region-specific aetiological data are limited, they are sufficient to highlight major trends: in high-burden settings, tuberculosis (TB) is a common cause of acute CAP; Gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae are regionally important; and HIV-associated opportunistic infections are common but difficult to diagnose. These differences in epidemiology and aetiological profile suggest that modified approaches to diagnosis, severity assessment and empirical antimicrobial therapy of CAP are necessary, but tailored individualized management approaches are constrained by limitations in the availability of radiological and laboratory diagnostic services, as well as medical expertise. The widespread introduction of the Xpert MTB/RIF platform represents a major advance for TB diagnosis, but innovations in rapid diagnostics for other opportunistic pathogens are urgently needed. Severity assessment tools (e.g. CURB65) that are used to guide early management decisions in CAP have not been widely validated in low-income settings and locally adapted tools are required. The optimal approach to initial antimicrobial therapy choices such as the need to provide early empirical cover for atypical bacteria and TB remain poorly defined. Improvements in supportive care such as correcting hypoxaemia and intravenous fluid management represent opportunities for substantial reductions in mortality."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "AIM: (i) evaluate the performance of MR-pro-ADM in reflecting the outcome and risk for CAP patients in the emergency department, and (ii) compare the prognostic performance of MR-pro-ADM with that of clinical scores PSI and CURB65.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "CURB65 score is used for stratification of which disease?", "id": "5a67ab79b750ff445500000b_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "AIM: (i) evaluate the performance of MR-pro-ADM in reflecting the outcome and risk for CAP patients in the emergency department, and (ii) compare the prognostic performance of MR-pro-ADM with that of clinical scores PSI and CURB65.METHODS: Observational prospective, single-center study in patients with suspected community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Eighty one patients underwent full clinical and laboratory assessment as by protocol, and were followed up a 28 days. Primary endpoints measured were: death, death at 14 days, non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV), endotracheal intubation (EI), ICU admission, overall hospital stay >10 days, emergency department stay >4 days. The discriminative performance of MR-pro-ADM and clinical scores was assessed by AUROC analysis.RESULTS: The distribution for MR-pro-ADM followed an upward trend, increasing with the increase of both PSI (p<0.001) and CURB65 (p<0.001) classes. However, the difference between MRproADM values and score classes was significant only in the case of CURB65 classes 0 and 1 (p = 0.046), 2 (p = 0.013), and 3 (p = 0.011); and with PSI classes 5, 3 (p = 0.044), and 1 (p = 0.020). As to the differences among variables for the six end-points, MR-pro-ADM values in the two groups selected for each considered end-point differed in a statistically significant manner for all endpoints. Both PSI and CURB65 differed significantly for all end-points, except for stay in the ED longer than 4 days and the hospital stay longer than 10 days and endotracheal intubation (only PSI classes differed with statistical significance). ROC analyses evidenced that MR-pro-ADM values gave the greatest AUC for the prediction of death, endotracheal intubation, hospital stay >10 days and DE stay >4 days, compared to the PSI and CURB (though difference not statistically significant). For each endpoint measured, the best thresholds values for Mr-pro-ADM were: 1.6 (specificity 76.5%; sensitivity 77.8%) for death; 2.5 (specificity 88.9%; sensitivity 80.0%) for death at 14 days; 1.5 (specificity 77.0%; sensitivity 87.5%) for NIMV; 2.4 (specificity 88.7%; sensitivity 83.3%) for endotracheal intubation; 0.9 (specificity 53.5%; sensitivity 70.6%) for DE stay greater than 4 days; 1.9 (specificity 82.1%; sensitivity 55.3%) for hospital stay greater than 10 days. The AUC for the combination of MR-pro-ADM and PSI was 81.29% [63.41%-99.17%], but not in a statistically significant manner compared to the AUCs of the single predictors. Conversely, the AUC for the combination of MR-pro-ADM and CURB65 was 87.58% [75.54%-99.62%], which was significantly greater than the AUC of CURB65 (p = 0.047) or PSI (p = 0.017) alone.CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that assessment of MR-pro-ADM levels in CAP patients in addition to CURB scores increases the prognostic accuracy of CURB alone and may help rule out discrepancies arising from flawed clinical severity classification. With particular reference to patients scoring in the upper classes of CURB and PSI, MR-pro-ADM values provided additional information towards a better risk stratification of those patients. In particular, our results pointed towards two MR-pro-ADM threshold values that appear to predict with a good degree of accuracy the patient's need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation, endotracheal intubation, or intensive care.

For each case, HBP was graded as adequate or suboptimal, based on Liver Image Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) criteria. The following laboratory data obtained within 3 months of the MRI date was extracted: total bilirubin (TB), direct bilirubin (DB), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and International normalised ratio (INR). Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores were calculated as 3.78×ln[TB] + 11.2×ln[INR] + 9.57×ln[creatinine] + 6.43. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to establish cut-off values for predicting suboptimal HBP.RESULTS: Of 284 patients, 242 (85.2%) patients (91; 57.6% male) had an adequate HBP and 42 (14.8%) patients (13; 61.9% male) had suboptimal HBP, with mean ages of 58.5±9.7 years and 55±12.7 years, respectively (p=0.096). Areas under the ROC curve for predicting suboptimal HBP were 0.85 (95%CI 0.79-0.91) for the MELD score, 0.88 (95%CI 0.82-0.93) for TB, and 0.91 (95%CI 0.86-0.95) for DB. Accuracy, positive likelihood ratios and cut-off values for predicting suboptimal HBP were, respectively: 86.7% and 11.2 for the MELD score ≥16.7, 88.2% and 28.7 for TB ≥4.3 mg/dl, and 91.1% and 36.4 for DB ≥1.3 mg/dl.

The model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is used for this purpose in most countries and incorporates bilirubin, International Normalized ratio, and creatinine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparability of creatinine results from different routine assays in the serum samples of patients with liver cirrhosis.METHODS: Residual material from 60 serum samples was available from patients in different stages of liver cirrhosis. Four centers participated; each center analyzed the samples with Jaffé-based and enzymatic routine assays in parallel. In addition, an accredited calibration laboratory certified the panel of samples by an internationally accepted reference measurement procedure (RMP) based on isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID-MS). This method served as the independent reference.RESULTS: All routine methods displayed a high correlation to the RMP (r ≥0.937, p<0.001). Two enzymatic and two Jaffé-based methods provided results that were all within a ±20% range of the RMP. The other methods showed deviations >20% in up to 27% of the samples. The enzymatic methods were systematically lower, whereas the Jaffé-based methods were systematically higher (p<0.001). The resulting MELD scores differed from 0 to 4 points.CONCLUSIONS: There are systematic deviations from the RMP.

Here, we examined the effects of CARM1 inhibition on dendritic spine and synapse morphology in the rat hippocampus. CARM1 was localized in hippocampal post-synapses, with immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy revealing co-localization of CARM1 with post-synaptic density (PSD)-95 protein, a post-synaptic marker.

This treatment method attempts to promote extinction of the fear memory associated with the initial traumatic experience. However, the subsequent prolonged exposure to such stimulus creates an additional layer of neural stress. Although the mechanism remains unclear, prolonged exposure therapy (PET) likely involves changes in synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter function and inflammation; especially in parts of the brain concerned with the formation and retrieval of fear memory (Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex: PFC). Since certain synaptic proteins are also involved in danger-associated molecular pattern signaling (DAMP), we identified the significance of IGF-1/IGF-1R/CaMKIIα expression as a potential link between the concurrent progression of synaptic and inflammatory changes in stress. Thus, a comparison between IGF-1/IGF-1R/CaMKIIα, synaptic and DAMP proteins in stress and PET may highlight the significance of PET on synaptic morphology and neuronal inflammatory response. In behaviorally characterized Sprague-Dawley rats, there was a significant decline in neural IGF-1 (p<0.001), hippocampal (p<0.001) and cortical (p<0.05) IGF-1R expression. These animals showed a significant loss of presynaptic markers (synaptophysin; p<0.001), and changes in neurotransmitters (VGLUT2, Tyrosine hydroxylase, GABA, ChAT). Furthermore, naïve stressed rats recorded a significant decrease in post-synaptic marker (PSD-95; p<0.01) and synaptic regulator (CaMKIIα; p<0.001). As part of the synaptic response to a decrease in brain CaMKIIα, small ion conductance channel (KCa2.2) was upregulated in the brain of naïve stressed rats (p<0.01). After a PET, an increase in IGF-1 (p<0.05) and IGF-1R was recorded in the Stress-PET group (p<0.001). As such, hippocampal (p<0.001), but not cortical (ns) synaptophysin expression increased in Stress-PET. Although PSD-95 was relatively unchanged in the hippocampus and PFC, CaMKIIα (p<0.001) and KCa2.2 (p<0.01) were upregulated in Stress-PET, and may be involved in extinction of fear memory-related synaptic potentials. These changes were also associated with a normalized neurotransmitter function, and a significant reduction in open space avoidance; when the animals were assessed in elevated plus maze (EPM). In addition to a decrease in IGF-1/IGF-1R, an increase in activated hippocampal and cortical microglia was seen in stress (p<0.05) and after a PET (Stress-PET; p<0.001). Furthermore, this was linked with a significant increase in HMGB1 (Hippocampus: p<0.001, PFC: p<0.05) and TLR4 expression (Hippocampus: p<0.01; PFC: ns) in the neurons. Taken together, this study showed that traumatic stress and subsequent PET involves an event-dependent alteration of IGF1/IGF-1R/CaMKIIα. Firstly, we showed a direct relationship between IGF-1/IGF-1R expression, presynaptic function (synaptophysin) and neurotransmitter activity in stress and PET. Secondly, we identified the possible role of CaMKIIα in post-synaptic function and regulation of small ion conductance channels.

To thoroughly depict the behavioral phenotype induced by adolescent THC exposure in male rats, we treated adolescent animals with increasing doses of THC twice a day (PND 35-45) and, at adulthood, we performed a battery of behavioral tests to measure affective- and psychotic-like symptoms as well as cognition. Poorer memory performance and psychotic-like behaviors were present after adolescent THC treatment in male rats, without alterations in the emotional component. At cellular level, the expression of the NMDA receptor subunit, GluN2B, as well as the levels of the AMPA subunits, GluA1 and GluA2, were significantly increased in hippocampal post-synaptic fractions from THC-exposed rats compared to controls. Furthermore, increases in the levels of the pre-synaptic marker, synaptophysin, and the post-synaptic marker, PSD95, were also present. Interestingly, KCl-induced [(3)H]D-ASP release from hippocampal synaptosomes, but not gliosomes, was significantly enhanced in THC-treated rats compared to controls. Moreover, in the same brain region, adolescent THC treatment also resulted in a persistent neuroinflammatory state, characterized by increased expression of the astrocyte marker, GFAP, increased levels of the pro-inflammatory markers, TNF-α, iNOS and COX-2, as well as a concomitant reduction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Notably, none of these alterations was observed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Together with our previous findings in females, these data suggest that the sex-dependent detrimental effects induced by adolescent THC exposure on adult behavior may rely on its ability to trigger different region-dependent changes in glutamate synapse and glial cells.

One explanation for this failure may be the invalidity of hypotheses focusing on amyloid to explain AD pathogenesis. Recently, hypotheses which are centered on synaptic and metabolic dysfunction are increasingly implicated in AD.OBJECTIVE: Evaluate AD hypotheses by comparing neurotransmitter and metabolite marker concentrations in normal versus AD CSF.METHODS: Meta-analysis allows for statistical comparison of pooled, existing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker data extracted from multiple publications, to obtain a more reliable estimate of concentrations. This method also provides a unique opportunity to rapidly validate AD hypotheses using the resulting CSF concentration data. Hubmed, Pubmed and Google Scholar were comprehensively searched for published English articles, without date restrictions, for the keywords \"AD\", \"CSF\", and \"human\" plus markers selected for synaptic and metabolic pathways. Synaptic markers were acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine, and glycine. Metabolic markers were glutathione, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and 8 other amino acids. Only studies that measured markers in AD and controls (Ctl), provided means, standard errors/deviation, and subject numbers were included. Data were extracted by six authors and reviewed by two others for accuracy. Data were pooled using ratio of means (RoM of AD/Ctl) and random effects meta-analysis using Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software.RESULTS: Of the 435 identified publications, after exclusion and removal of duplicates, 35 articles were included comprising a total of 605 AD patients and 585 controls. The following markers of synaptic and metabolic pathways were significantly changed in AD/controls: acetylcholine (RoM 0.36, 95% CI 0.24-0.53, p<0.00001), GABA (0.74, 0.58-0.94, p<0.01), pyruvate (0.48, 0.24-0.94, p=0.03), glutathione (1.11, 1.01- 1.21, p=0.03), alanine (1.10, 0.98-1.23, p=0.09), and lower levels of significance for lactate (1.2, 1.00-1.47, p=0.05). Of note, CSF glucose and glutamate levels in AD were not significantly different than that of the controls.CONCLUSION: This study provides proof of concept for the use of meta-analysis validation of AD hypotheses, specifically via robust evidence for the cholinergic hypothesis of AD. Our data disagree with the other synaptic hypotheses of glutamate excitotoxicity and GABAergic resistance to neurodegeneration, given observed unchanged glutamate levels and decreased GABA levels. With regards to metabolic hypotheses, the data supported upregulation of anaerobic glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (glutathione), and anaplerosis of the tricarboxylic acid cycle using glutamate. Future applications of meta-analysis indicate the possibility of further in silico evaluation and generation of novel hypotheses in the AD field.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "elective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM),", "answer_start": 26}], "question": "What is a SERM?", "id": "5a74e9ad0384be955100000a_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Although best known as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), tamoxifen is a drug with a wide range of activities.

Currently, there are two classes of clinically approved SERMs; triphenylethylene derivatives (e.g., tamoxifen) and benzothiophene derivatives (e.g., raloxifene).

We tested whether the therapeutic selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM), raloxifene and tamoxifen, can perturb DC development and activation. SERM, used in treatment of breast cancer and osteoporosis, bind to ER and mediate tissue-specific agonistic or antagonistic effects. Raloxifene and tamoxifen inhibited the differentiation of estrogen-dependent DC from bone marrow precursors ex vivo in competition experiments with physiological levels of E2. DC differentiated in the presence of SERM were assessed for their capacity to internalize fluoresceinated Ags as well as respond to inflammatory stimuli by increasing surface expression of molecules important for APC function. Although SERM-exposed DC exhibited increased ability to internalize Ags, they were hyporesponsive to bacterial LPS: relative to control DC, they less efficiently up-regulated the expression of MHC class II, CD86, and to a lesser extent, CD80 and CD40. This phenotype indicates that these SERM act to maintain DC in an immature state by inhibiting DC responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Thus, raloxifene and tamoxifen impair E2-promoted DC differentiation and reduce the immunostimulatory capacity of DC.

SERMs known to cause ovarian cysts upregulate Cyp17a1 after only 4 days of dosing and suppression of the HPO axis prevented this regulation, indicating that ovarian expression of Cyp17a1 was secondary to SERM's effect on the brain.

Eight weeks after OVX, a bilateral lumbar spinal fusion procedure was performed using autologous iliac bone. In each group, gene expression was evaluated at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the fusion procedure, histologic analysis was performed at 4 and 8 weeks after the procedure, and bone parameters were measured by micro-computed tomography at 2 days, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after the procedure.RESULTS: Bone mineral density and trabecular quality of the vertebral body were significantly higher in the SERM group compared with the OVX group 16 weeks after OVX. The fusion rate and bone volume ratio were higher in the fusion bed of the SERM group compared with the OVX group 8 weeks after the fusion procedure. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at 4 and 8 weeks after the fusion procedure showed increased expression of the genes for osteoblast-related markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, runt-related transcription factor 2, and transforming growth factor) in the SERM group compared with the OVX group. The OVX group showed sparse bone mass between transverse processes. By contrast, the SERM group exhibited a compact bridging fusion mass within the fusion bed at 8 weeks after the fusion procedure.CONCLUSIONS: Selective estrogen receptor modulator treatment improved the trabecular quality of the vertebral body, enhanced spinal fusion, and increased the amount of compact bone mass within the fusion bed in rats that had received an ovariectomy. Therapeutic SERM treatment may be recommended to improve the fusion rate in osteoporotic patients who undergo spinal fusion.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of all referred SERMs in bone and cardiovascular system are estrogenic, namely they inhibit postmenopausal bone loss and favorably influence plasma lipoproteins and some coagulation factors. The aim of this paper is to review the effects of SERMs on estrogen-dependent breast tissues and on the endometrium. There are two types of SERMs in clinical use, based on their chemical structure: the triphenylethylenes and the benzothiophenes. The prototype of the SERMs with triphenylethylene structure is tamoxifen. Tamoxifen, like all other SERMs, is an estrogen antagonist in the breast and is widely used for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. A recent study suggests that tamoxifen also may prevent breast cancer in patients at risk. Because of the partial estrogenic activity of tamoxifen in the endometrium, its clinical use is associated with uterine hypertrophy and an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Other triphenylethylene SERMs, droloxifene, toremifene, and idoxifene, also show efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer, in a manner similar to tamoxifen. A better toxicology profile and a decreased endometrial estrogen agonism may be advantages of the new triphenylethylene SERMs. Raloxifene is a SERM with a chemical structure different from triphenylethylenes. Raloxifene, a benzothiophene, possesses an estrogen-antagonistic effect in the breast similar to triphenylethylenes. Clinical studies on postmenopausal osteoporotic women on raloxifene as compared with placebo show a significant decrease in the rate of newly diagnosed breast cancers. In clinical studies, in contrast to tamoxifen, no stimulatory effect in the endometrium could be observed with raloxifene."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)", "answer_start": 14}], "question": "What is a SERM?", "id": "5a74e9ad0384be955100000a_024", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "INTRODUCTION: Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been used off-label in men for more than 50 years. SERMs exert their action on the estrogen receptor agonistically or antagonistically. A fundamental knowledge of the complex molecular action and physiology of SERMs is important in understanding their use and future directions of study in men.AIM: To review the basic science and mechanism of the action of estrogens, the estrogen receptor, and SERMs, and the existing clinical publications on the use of SERMs in men for infertility and hypogonadism with their strengths and weaknesses and to identify the need for future studies.METHODS: After a review of publications on the basic science of estrogen receptors, a chronologic review of published evidence-based studies on the use of SERMs in men for infertility and hypogonadism was undertaken.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical publications were assessed for type of study, inclusion criteria, outcome measurements, and results. Strengths and weaknesses of the publications were assessed and discussed.RESULTS: Few prospective rigorously controlled trials have been undertaken on the use of SERMs in men. Most existing trials are largely retrospective anecdotal studies with inconsistent inclusion and end-point measurements. The SERMs are complex and at times can produce paradoxical results. Their action likely depends on the genetics of the individual, his tissue-specific composition of estrogen receptors, the molecular structure and pharmacodynamics of the SERMs, and their metabolism.CONCLUSION: Rigorously controlled trials of the use of SERMs in men are needed to better identify their clinical benefit and long-term safety in infertile and hypogonadal men. Recent placebo-controlled pharmaceutical industry SERM trials have demonstrated short-term safety and efficacy in men with secondary hypogonadism and eventually might provide an alternative to exogenous testosterone replacement therapy in men with secondary hypogonadism.

Approximately 200 million patients worldwide are affected. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) estimated that up to 18% of US women aged 50 and older have osteoporosis and up to 50% have osteopenia. Greater than 2 million osteoporotic related fractures occurred in the United States with direct healthcare costs exceeding $17 billion. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) was a popular option for postmenopausal women before the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Several agents are available in the U.S., including bisphosphonates, hormone therapy, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene. There are concerns about long term safety and compliance. Therefore, other agents are under investigation. SERMs are a diverse group of agents that bind to the estrogen receptor and each SERM appears to have a unique set of clinical responses, which are not always consistent with the typical responses seen with other SERMs. This article will discuss the SERMs approved in the United States, tamoxifene and raloxifene, and investigational SERMs. The ideal SERM would include the beneficial effects of estrogen in bone, heart and the central nervous system, with neutral or antagonistic effects in tissues where estrogen effects are undesirable(breast and endometrium). A new target in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis is the tissue estrogen complex or the pairing of a SERM with a conjugated estrogen known as a tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC). This novel approach is currently being evaluated with bazodoxifene which could yield the beneficial effects of estrogens and SERMS, while potentially being more tolerable and safer than either therapy alone."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)", "answer_start": 74}], "question": "What is a SERM?", "id": "5a74e9ad0384be955100000a_027", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVE: To provide a brief review of the history of the development of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), the current data assessing the effect of SERMs at the organ level, and the mechanism of action of these agents.METHODS: All the pertinent medical literature was reviewed, and the effects of SERMs on various end-organs were summarized.RESULTS: SERMs have been available for clinical use since the late 1960s. By the late 1980s, several SERMs had become available that influenced clinical practice. Multiorgan effects of these compounds include variable clinical efficacy for treatment of menopausal symptoms involving the central nervous system, variable effects on the genitourinary tract, and, in general, positive effects on serum lipid levels. SERMs seem to affect bone density positively, albeit to variable degrees, depending on the agent being used. The greatest effect of SERMs has been on the breast, and current SERMs seem to have efficacy for prevention of breast cancer as opposed to the controversial effect of estrogen on the breast. Disadvantages of SERMs include exacerbation of menopausal symptoms and, as with estrogen, an increased incidence of venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli.

The molecular basis of SERM activity involves binding of the ligand SERM to the estrogen receptor (ER), causing conformational changes which facilitate interactions with coactivator or corepressor proteins, and subsequently initiate or suppress transcription of target genes. SERM activity is intrinsic to each ER ligand, which accomplishes its unique profile by specific interactions in the target cell, leading to tissue selective actions. We discuss the estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects of early SERMs, such as clomiphene citrate, used for treatment of ovulation induction, and the triphenylethylene, tamoxifen, which has ER antagonist activity in the breast, and is used for prevention and treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. Since the development of tamoxifen, other triphenylethylene SERMs have been studied for breast cancer prevention, including droloxifene, idoxifene, toremifene, and ospemifene.

The clinical application of long-term adjuvant antihormone therapy for the breast cancer has significantly improved breast cancer survival. However, acquired resistance to SERM remains a significant challenge in breast cancer treatment. The evolution of acquired resistance to SERMs treatment was primarily discovered using MCF-7 tumors transplanted in athymic mice to mimic years of adjuvant treatment in patients. Acquired resistance to tamoxifen is unique because the growth of resistant tumors is dependent on SERMs. It appears that acquired resistance to SERM is initially able to utilize either E2 or a SERM as the growth stimulus in the SERM-resistant breast tumors. Mechanistic studies reveal that SERMs continuously suppress nuclear ER-target genes even during resistance, whereas they function as agonists to activate multiple membrane-associated molecules to promote cell growth. Laboratory observations in vivo further show that three phases of acquired SERM-resistance exists, depending on the length of SERMs exposure. Tumors with Phase I resistance are stimulated by both SERMs and estrogen. Tumors with Phase II resistance are stimulated by SERMs, but are inhibited by estrogen due to apoptosis. The laboratory models suggest a new treatment strategy, in which limited-duration, low-dose estrogen can be used to purge Phase II-resistant breast cancer cells. This discovery provides an invaluable insight into the evolution of drug resistance to SERMs, and this knowledge is now being used to justify clinical trials of estrogen therapy following long-term antihormone therapy. All of these results suggest that cell populations that have acquired resistance are in constant evolution depending upon selection pressure.

Tamoxifen activates SERM stimulated breast and endometrial tumour growth. Tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate have side-effects that can affect therapeutic outcomes. The primary goal of the current study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of lower doses of both agents when given in combination to mice with SERM sensitive, oestrogen stimulated tumour xenografts (MCF-7 E2 tumours). Experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of SERM stimulated breast (MCF-7 Tam, MCF-7 Ral) and endometrial tumours (EnCa 101) to demonstrate the activity of brivanib alaninate in SERM resistant models.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the current study, tumour xenografts were minced and bi-transplanted into the mammary fat pads of athymic, ovariectomised mice. Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine an effective oral dose of tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate that had minimal effect on tumour growth. Doses of 125 microg of tamoxifen and 0.05 mg/g of brivanib alaninate were evaluated. An experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of the two agents together when started at the time of tumour implantation. An additional experiment was done in which tumours were already established and then treated, to obtain enough tumour tissue for molecular analysis.RESULTS: Brivanib alaninate was effective at inhibiting tumour growth in SERM sensitive (MCF-7 E2) and SERM stimulated (EnCa 101, MCF-7 Ral, MCF-7 Tam) models. The effect of the low dose drug combination as an anti-tumour strategy for SERM sensitive (MCF-7 E2) in early treatment was as effective as higher doses of either drug used alone. In established tumours, the combination is successful at decreasing tumour growth, while neither agent alone is effective. Molecular analysis revealed a decreased phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in tumours that were treated with brivanib alaninate and an increase in VEGFA transcription to compensate for the blockade of VEGFR-2 by increasing the transcription of VEGFA. Tamoxifen increases the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and this effect is abrogated by brivanib alaninate. There was also increased necrosis in tumours treated with brivanib alaninate.CONCLUSION: Historically, tamoxifen has a role in blocking angiogenesis as well as the blockade of the ER. Tamoxifen and a low dose of an angiogenesis inhibitor, brivanib alaninate, can potentially be combined not only to maximise therapeutic efficacy but also to retard SERM resistant tumour growth.Copyright  2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, blocking estrogen mediated actions remains the strategy of choice for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are molecules that block estrogen action in breast cancer, but can still potentially maintain the beneficial effects of estrogen in other tissues, such as bone and cardiovascular system. Tamoxifen, the prototypical drug of this class has been used extensively for the past 30 years to treat and prevent breast cancer. The target of drug action, ERs alpha and beta, are the two receptors which are responsible for the first step in estrogen and SERM action. The SERM binds to the ERs and confers a unique conformation to the complex. In a target site which expresses antiestrogenic actions, the conformation of the ER is distinctly different from estrogen bound ER. The complex recruits protein partners called corepressors to prevent the transcription of estrogen responsive genes. In contrast, at a predominantly estrogenic site coactivators for estrogen action are recruited. Unfortunately at an antiestrogenic site such as breast cancer, long term SERM therapy causes the development of acquired resistance. The breast and endometrial tumor cells selectively become SERM stimulated. Overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases, HER-2, EGFR and IGFR and the signaling cascades following their activation are frequently involved in SERM resistant breast cancers. The aberrantly activated PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways and their cross talk with the genomic components of the ER action are implicated in SERM resistance. Other down stream factors of HER-2 and EGFR signaling, such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK or mTOR pathways has also been found to be involved in resistance mechanisms. Blocking the actions of HER-2 and EGFR represent a rational strategy for treating SERM resistant phenotypes and may in fact restore the sensitivity to the SERMs. Another approach exploits the discovery that low dose estrogen will induce apoptosis in the SERM resistant breast cancers.

Collectively they indicate that different ER ligands induce distinct structural changes in the receptor that influence its ability to interact with other proteins (e.g., coactivators or corepressors) critical for the regulation of target gene transcription. The relative expression of coactivators and corepressors, and the nature of the ER and of its target gene promoter affect SERM biocharacter. Taken together, SERM selectivity reflects the diversity of ER forms and coregulators, cell type differences in their expression, and the diversity of ER target genes. This model provides a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of SERM action, and should help identify new SERMs with enhanced tissue or target gene selectivity."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators", "answer_start": 3}], "question": "What is a SERM?", "id": "5a74e9ad0384be955100000a_045", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators) are a new class of molecules that bind to the estrogen receptor, resulting in an estradiol agonist or antagonist response according to the target tissue.

The processing of RNA/DNA primers requires a group of structure-specific nucleases typified by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1).

The dynamic interactions of polymerase δ, FEN1 and DNA ligase I with proliferating cell nuclear antigen allow these enzymes to act sequentially during Okazaki fragment maturation. Such protein-protein interactions may be regulated by post-translational modifications.

Two forms of human DNA polymerase δ were studied: Pol δ4 and Pol δ3, which represent the heterotetramer and the heterotrimer lacking the p12 subunit, respectively.

In this review, we describe the function of Dna2 in Okazaki fragment processing, and discuss its role in the maintenance of genome integrity with an emphasis on its functional interactions with other factors required for genome maintenance."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Lagging strand replication involves a very complex set of interacting proteins that are able to frequently initiate, elongate and process Okazaki fragments of 180 bp", "answer_start": 548}], "question": "What cellular process are okazaki fragments associated with?", "id": "5a79d0b8faa1ab7d2e00000d_010", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "DNA replication is one of the most important events in living cells, and it is still a key problem how the DNA replication machinery works in its details. A replication fork has to be a very dynamic apparatus since frequent DNA polymerase switches from the initiating DNA polymerase alpha to the processive elongating DNA polymerase delta occur at the leading strand (about 8 x 10(4) fold on both strands in one replication round) as well as at the lagging strand (about 2 x 10(7) fold on both strands in one replication round) in mammalian cells. Lagging strand replication involves a very complex set of interacting proteins that are able to frequently initiate, elongate and process Okazaki fragments of 180 bp. Moreover, key proteins of this important process appear to be controlled by S-phase check-point proteins. It became furthermore clear in the last few years that DNA replication cannot be considered uncoupled from DNA repair, another very important event for any living organism. The reconstitution of nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair in vitro with purified components clearly showed that the DNA synthesis machinery of both of these macromolecular events are similar and do share many components of the lagging strand DNA synthesis machinery.

In eubacteria, DNA PolI (polymerase I) contains a flap processing domain, the N-terminal 5'-->3' exonuclease. We present evidence of paralogous FEN-encoding genes present in many eubacteria. Two distinct classes of these independent FEN-encoding genes exist with four groups of eubacteria, being identified based on the number and type of FEN gene encoded. The respective proteins possess distinct motifs hallmarking their differentiation. Crucially, based on primary sequence and predicted secondary structural motifs, we reveal key differences at their active sites. These results are supported by biochemical characterization of two family members--ExoIX (exonuclease IX) from Escherichia coli and SaFEN (Staphylococcus aureus FEN). These proteins displayed marked differences in their ability to process a range of branched and linear DNA structures. On bifurcated substrates, SaFEN exhibited similar substrate specificity to previously characterized FENs. In quantitative exonuclease assays, SaFEN maintained a comparable activity with that reported for PolI. However, ExoIX showed no observable enzymatic activity. A threaded model is presented for SaFEN, demonstrating the probable interaction of this newly identified class of FEN with divalent metal ions and a branched DNA substrate.

Class I Okazaki fragments (about 20%) were separated from longer nascent DNA chains by a single phosphodiester bond interruption (nick) and were quantitatively identified by treating purified replicating DNA with Escherichia coli DNA ligase and then measuring the fraction of Okazaki fragments joined to longer nascent DNA chains. Similarly, class II Okazaki fragments (about 30%) were separated by a region of single-stranded DNA template (gap) that could be filled and sealed by T4 DNA polymerase plus E. coli DNA ligase, and class III fragments (about 50%) were separated by RNA primers that could be removed with E. coli DNA olymerase I, allowing the fragments to be joined with E. coli DNA ligase. These results were obtained with replicating SV40 DNA that had been briefly labeled with radioactive precursors in either intact cells or isolated nuclei. When isolated nuclei were further incubated in the presence of cytosol, all of the Okazaki fragments were converted into longer DNA strands as expected for intermediates in DNA synthesis. However, when washed nuclei were incubated in the abscence of cytosol, both class I and class II Okazaki fragments accumulated despite the excision of RNA primers: class III Okazaki fragments and RNA-DNA covalent linkages both disappeared at similar rates. These data demonstrate the existence of RNA primers in whole cells as well as in isolated nuclei, and identify a unique gap-filling step that is not simply an extension of the DNA chain elongation process concomitant with the excision of RNA primers. One or more factos found in cytosol, in addition to DNA polymerase alpha, are specifically involved in the gap-filling and ligation steps. The sizes of mature Okazaki fragments (class I) and Okazaki fragments whose synthesis was completed by T4 DNA polymerase were measured by gel electrophoresis and found to be broadly distributed between 40 and 290 nucleotides with an average length of 135 nucleotides. Since 80% and 90% of the Okazaments does not occur at uniformly spaced intervals along the DNA template. During the excision of RNA primers, nascent DNA chains with a single ribonucleotide covalently attached to the 5' terminus were identified as transient intermediates. These intermediates accumulated during excision of RNA primers in the presence of adenine 9-beta-D-arabinoside 5'-triphosphate, and those Okazaki fragments blocked by RNA primers (class III) were found to have originated the farthest from the 5' ends of long nascent DNA strands. Thus, RNA primers appear to be excised in two steps with the second step, removal of the final ribonucleotide, being stimulated by concomitant DNA synthesis.

However, multiple factors, including improper implementation of testing strategies and clerical errors, have been reported to lead to HIV misdiagnosis. The World Health Organization has recommended HIV retesting prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation which has become pertinent with scaling up of Early Access to ART for All (EAAA). In this analysis, misdiagnosed clients are identified from a subgroup of clients enrolled in EAAA implementation study in Swaziland.METHODS: The subgroup to assess misdiagnosis was identified from enrolled EAAA study clients, who had an undetectable viral load prior to ART initiation between September 1, 2014 and May 31, 2016. One hundred and five of 2533 (4%) clients had an undetectable viral load prior to initiation to ART (pre-ART). The HIV status of clients was confirmed using the Determine HIV 1/2 and Uni-Gold HIV 1/2 rapid tests performed serially as recommended by the national testing algorithm. The status of clients on ART was additionally confirmed by fourth-generation HIV Ag/Ab combo tests, Architect and Genscreen Ultra.RESULTS: Fourteen of the 105 (13%) clients were false positive (HIV negative) on confirmation testing, of whom five (36%) were still in pre-ART care, while nine (64%) were in ART care. Overall, proportion of false positive was 0.6% (14/2533). The false-positive clients had a median CD4 of 791 cells/ml (interquartile range (IQR): 628, 967) compared to 549 cells/ml (IQR: 387, 791) for true positives (HIV positive) (p = 0.0081) and were nearly 20 years older (p = 0.0008).CONCLUSIONS: Overall 0.6% of all enrolled EAAA clients were misdiagnosed, and 64% of misdiagnosed clients were initiated on ART. With adoption of EAAA guidelines by national governments, ART initiation regardless of immunological criteria, strengthening of proficiency testing and adoption of retesting prior to ART initiation would allow identification of misdiagnosed clients and further reduce potential of initiating misdiagnosed clients on ART."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "INTRODUCTION: We describe the overall accuracy and performance of a serial rapid HIV testing algorithm used in community-based HIV testing in the context of a population-based household survey conducted in two sub-districts of uMgungundlovu district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, against reference fourth-generation HIV-1/2 antibody and p24 antigen combination immunoassays.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is included in the fourth generation HIV test?", "id": "5a68fd01b750ff445500001b_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "INTRODUCTION: We describe the overall accuracy and performance of a serial rapid HIV testing algorithm used in community-based HIV testing in the context of a population-based household survey conducted in two sub-districts of uMgungundlovu district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, against reference fourth-generation HIV-1/2 antibody and p24 antigen combination immunoassays. We discuss implications of the findings on rapid HIV testing programmes.METHODS: Cross-sectional design: Following enrolment into the survey, questionnaires were administered to eligible and consenting participants in order to obtain demographic and HIV-related data. Peripheral blood samples were collected for HIV-related testing. Participants were offered community-based HIV testing in the home by trained field workers using a serial algorithm with two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in series. In the laboratory, reference HIV testing was conducted using two fourth-generation immunoassays with all positives in the confirmatory test considered true positives. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and false-positive and false-negative rates were determined.RESULTS: Of 10,236 individuals enrolled in the survey, 3740 were tested in the home (median age 24 years (interquartile range 19-31 years), 42.1% males and HIV positivity on RDT algorithm 8.0%). From those tested, 3729 (99.7%) had a definitive RDT result as well as a laboratory immunoassay result. The overall accuracy of the RDT when compared to the fourth-generation immunoassays was 98.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 98.5-99.2). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 91.1% (95% CI 87.5-93.7), 99.9% (95% CI 99.8-100), 99.3% (95% CI 97.4-99.8) and 99.1% (95% CI 98.8-99.4) respectively. The false-positive and false-negative rates were 0.06% (95% CI 0.01-0.24) and 8.9% (95% CI 6.3-12.53). Compared to true positives, false negatives were more likely to be recently infected on limited antigen avidity assay and to report antiretroviral therapy (ART) use.CONCLUSIONS: The overall accuracy of the RDT algorithm was high. However, there were few false positives, and the sensitivity was lower than expected with high false negatives, despite implementation of quality assurance measures. False negatives were associated with recent (early) infection and ART exposure. The RDT algorithm was able to correctly identify the majority of HIV infections in community-based HIV testing.

Initial lab work revealed a new thrombocytopenia, marked renal failure and an elevated creatine kinase, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer. A bone marrow biopsy revealed HLH. As part of the work up for thrombocytopenia, a rapid HIV antibody based assay was done and was negative. The sample was later routinely tested with a fourth generation antigen/antibody assay as per local protocol and was strongly positive. The plasma RNA viral load was >10,000,000 copies /mL confirming the diagnosis of an acute HIV infection. The patient was urgently started on antiretroviral therapy and recovered.CONCLUSION: This case illustrates a diagnostic approach to HLH which is an uncommon but life threatening multisystem disease, requiring the involvement of a multidisciplinary team of experts. Following any diagnosis of HLH, rapid identification and treatment of the underlying condition is critical. A negative rapid HIV antibody test can be misleading in the context of early HIV infection and the additional use of fourth generation antigen/antibody test or plasma RNA viral load may be required within the right clinical context for diagnosis."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The fourth-generation HIV EIA was positive presumably because it detects p24 HIV antigen as well as antibodies, unlike rapid HIV tests and third-generation HIV EIAs.This case highlights not only the importance of frontline providers to understand the different testing methodologies for HIV screening and their limitations but the importance of clinical suspicion as well.", "answer_start": 603}], "question": "What is included in the fourth generation HIV test?", "id": "5a68fd01b750ff445500001b_011", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Universal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening was recommended in 2012, and major improvements in HIV testing have occurred in the past decade, but identification of HIV infected individuals remains inadequate in the United States.

We extracted data on the primary outcome measures: treatment success; severity of pain or tenderness at the radial styloid; functional impairment of the wrist or hand; and outcome of Finkelstein's test, and the secondary outcome measures: proportion of patients with side effects; type of side effects and patient satisfaction with injection treatment.MAIN RESULTS: We found one controlled clinical trial of 18 participants (all pregnant or lactating women) that compared one steroid injection with methylprednisolone and bupivacaine to splinting with a thumb spica. All patients in the steroid injection group (9/9) achieved complete relief of pain whereas none of the patients in the thumb spica group (0/9) had complete relief of pain, one to six days after intervention (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 1.2). No side effects or local complications of steroid injection were noted.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis has been studied in only one small controlled clinical trial, which found steroid injections to be superior to thumb spica splinting. However, the applicability of our findings to daily clinical practice is limited, as they are based on only one trial with a small number of included participants, the methodological quality was poor and only pregnant and lactating women participated in the study.

Finkelstein hypothesized that the entry of the muscle bellies of the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) and abductor pollicis longus (APL) tendons into the first extensor compartment was responsible for the findings observed in his now eponymous test. We agree with Finkelstein's hypothesis and further hypothesize that this position would induce measurable bulk (muscle mass within the retinaculum) and tethering (stretching of synovial tissue) effects within the compartment. To test this latter hypothesis we measured the excursion and gliding resistance of the EPB and APL tendons within the first compartment.METHODS: Fifteen fresh-frozen cadavers were used. Gliding resistance and excursion were measured in 4 different wrist positions, including the wrist position of Finkelstein's test (30 degrees ulnar deviation). The bulk and tethering effect was calculated based on the mean gliding resistance over the tendon proximal/distal excursion cycle and the gliding resistance at the terminal distal excursion.RESULTS: The EPB tendon excursion was significantly more distal in 30 degrees ulnar deviation than in 60 degrees extension. Additionally the bulk and tethering resistance was significantly greater in 30 degrees ulnar deviation compared with 60 degrees extension. For the APL tendon there was no significant difference in either the tendon excursion or the bulk and tethering resistance between 30 degrees ulnar deviation and 60 degrees extension.CONCLUSIONS: We showed that in the position of Finkelstein's test the EPB tendon is significantly more distal and has significantly greater bulk and tethering effect compared with the other EPB positions.

However, the last few years have witnessed the realization that a large class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), named microRNAs, contribute to cancer development and progression by acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Recent studies have also shown that epigenetic silencing of microRNAs with tumor suppressor features by CpG island hypermethylation is a common hallmark of human tumors. Thus, we wondered whether there were other ncRNAs undergoing aberrant DNA methylation-associated silencing in transformed cells. We focused on the transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), a subset of DNA sequences that are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes and that are located in both intra- and intergenic regions. We used a pharmacological and genomic approach to reveal the possible existence of an aberrant epigenetic silencing pattern of T-UCRs by treating cancer cells with a DNA-demethylating agent followed by hybridization to an expression microarray containing these sequences. We observed that DNA hypomethylation induces release of T-UCR silencing in cancer cells. Among the T-UCRs that were reactivated upon drug treatment, Uc.160+, Uc283+A and Uc.346+ were found to undergo specific CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells compared with normal tissues. The analysis of a large set of primary human tumors (n=283) demonstrated that hypermethylation of the described T-UCR CpG islands was a common event among the various tumor types.

It confronts objections that the approach is simplistic, incompatible with a virtue-based approach to medicine, that it requires respect for autonomy always to have priority when the principles clash at the expense of clinical obligations to benefit patients and global justice. It agrees that the approach does not provide universalisable methods either for resolving such moral dilemmas arising from conflict between the principles or their derivatives, or universalisable methods for resolving disagreements about the scope of these principles-long acknowledged lacunae but arguably to be found, in practice, with all other approaches to medical ethics. The value of the approach, when properly understood, is to provide a universalisable though prima facie set of moral commitments which all doctors can accept, a basic moral language and a basic moral analytic framework. These can underpin an intercultural 'moral mission statement' for the goals and practice of medicine."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Contemporary clinical ethics was founded on principlism, and the four principles: respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice, remain dominant in medical ethics discourse and practice.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "List four principles of medical ethics.", "id": "5a6f7e6ab750ff4455000052_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Contemporary clinical ethics was founded on principlism, and the four principles: respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice, remain dominant in medical ethics discourse and practice.

As the practice of medicine globalizes, it remains critical to examine the extent to which both the four-principle framework, and individual principles among the four, suffice patients and practitioners in different social and cultural contexts. Using the four-principle model we analyze two accounts of surrogate decision making - one from the developed and one from the developing world - in which the clinician undertakes medical decision-making with apparently little input from the patient and/or family. The purpose of this analysis is to highlight challenges in assessing ethical behaviour according to the principlist model. We next describe cultural expectations and mores that inform both patient and clinician behaviors in these scenarios in order to argue that the principle of respect for persons informed by culture-specific ideas of personhood may offer an improved ethical construct for analyzing and guiding medical practice in a globalized and plural world."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Each of the four principles (beneficence, nonmaleficence,justice and autonomy) is investigated in turn, looking in particular at the extent to which each is rooted in the Islamic paradigm.", "answer_start": 557}], "question": "List four principles of medical ethics.", "id": "5a6f7e6ab750ff4455000052_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The principles underpinning Islam's ethical framework applied to routine clinical scenarios remain insufficiently understood by many clinicians, thereby unfortunately permitting the delivery of culturally insensitive healthcare.This paper summarises the foundations of the Islamic ethical theory, elucidating the principles and methodology employed by the Muslim jurist in deriving rulings in the field of medical ethics.

This study tests whether these principles can be quantitatively measured on an individual level, and then subsequently if they are used in the decision making process when individuals are faced with ethical dilemmas.METHODS: The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used as a tool for the measurement of the principles. Four scenarios, which involved conflicts between the medical ethical principles, were presented to participants who then made judgments about the ethicality of the action in the scenario, and their intentions to act in the same manner if they were in the situation.RESULTS: Individual preferences for these medical ethical principles can be measured using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This technique provides a useful tool in which to highlight individual medical ethical values. On average, individuals have a significant preference for non-maleficence over the other principles, however, and perhaps counter-intuitively, this preference does not seem to relate to applied ethical judgements in specific ethical dilemmas.CONCLUSIONS: People state they value these medical ethical principles but they do not actually seem to use them directly in the decision making process. The reasons for this are explained through the lack of a behavioural model to account for the relevant situational factors not captured by the principles.

One of the key areas of morbidity associated with diabetes is the diabetic foot. To improve the care of patients with diabetic foot and to provide an evidence-based multidisciplinary management approach, the Society for Vascular Surgery in collaboration with the American Podiatric Medical Association and the Society for Vascular Medicine developed this clinical practice guideline.METHODS: The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. This was based on five systematic reviews of the literature. Specific areas of focus included (1) prevention of diabetic foot ulceration, (2) off-loading, (3) diagnosis of osteomyelitis, (4) wound care, and (5) peripheral arterial disease.RESULTS: Although we identified only limited high-quality evidence for many of the critical questions, we used the best available evidence and considered the patients' values and preferences and the clinical context to develop these guidelines. We include preventive recommendations such as those for adequate glycemic control, periodic foot inspection, and patient and family education. We recommend using custom therapeutic footwear in high-risk diabetic patients, including those with significant neuropathy, foot deformities, or previous amputation. In patients with plantar diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), we recommend off-loading with a total contact cast or irremovable fixed ankle walking boot. In patients with a new DFU, we recommend probe to bone test and plain films to be followed by magnetic resonance imaging if a soft tissue abscess or osteomyelitis is suspected. We provide recommendations on comprehensive wound care and various débridement methods. For DFUs that fail to improve (>50% wound area reduction) after a minimum of 4 weeks of standard wound therapy, we recommend adjunctive wound therapy options. In patients with DFU who have peripheral arterial disease, we recommend revascularization by either surgical bypass or endovascular therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Whereas these guidelines have addressed five key areas in the care of DFUs, they do not cover all the aspects of this complex condition. Going forward as future evidence accumulates, we plan to update our recommendations accordingly.Copyright © 2016 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects.OBJECTIVES: To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE (https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm); and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non-randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short-term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.MAIN RESULTS: We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses. Mefloquine efficacyOf 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short-term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%).In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline in non-immune, short-term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants). Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone-proguanil Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone-proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; high-certainty evidence). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone-proguanil (940 travellers).One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short-term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, moderate-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, moderate-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, moderate-certainty evidence), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, moderate-certainty evidence). The cohort studies in longer-term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (high-certainty evidence) and dizziness (high-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone-proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood. Mefloquine safety versus doxycyclineNo difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (low-certainty evidence) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; low-certainty evidence).Six cohort studies in longer-term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short-term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, very low-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, very low-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short-term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia.Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, low certainty-evidence), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, very low-certainty evidence), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, very low-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non-military participants, provided no conclusive findings.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The absolute risk of malaria during short-term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil).The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once-weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Many drugs are responsible for this phototoxic reaction, especially tetracyclines, psoralens, chloramphenicol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fluoroquinolones, and, rarely, doxycycline.

We tested 14 patients treated with doxycycline and we found similar levels of doxycycline in the serum and the hair samples representing the last 4 months. Linear regression analysis revealed that the level of doxycycline in the serum remained stable over time (p = 0.7) but the level of doxycycline in the hair decreased significantly over time (p = 0.03) indicating a degradation of this molecule in the hair. We detected two patients who did not have antibiotic in the hair, indicating a lack of compliance that was also confirmed by interview.CONCLUSION: Hair samples can be used to test long-term compliance in patients to explain failures or relapses.Copyright © 2015 The British Infection Association.

Here we examined if mossy cells exhibit long-term plasticity in the posttraumatic, hyperexcitable dentate gyrus. Mossy cells 1 wk after fluid percussion head injury did not show alterations in their current-firing frequency (I-F) and current-membrane voltage (I-V) relationships. In spite of the unchanged I-F and I-V curves, mossy cells showed extensive modifications in Na(+), K(+) and h-currents, indicating the coordinated nature of these opposing modifications. Computational experiments in a realistic large-scale model of the dentate gyrus demonstrated that individually, these perturbations could significantly affect network activity. Synaptic inputs also displayed systematic, opposing modifications. Miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes were decreased, whereas miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitudes were increased as expected from a homeostatic response to network hyperexcitability. In addition, opposing alterations in miniature and spontaneous synaptic event frequencies and amplitudes were observed for both EPSCs and IPSCs. Despite extensive changes in synaptic inputs, cannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition was not altered in posttraumatic mossy cells. These data demonstrate that many intrinsic and synaptic properties of mossy cells undergo highly specific, long-term alterations after traumatic brain injury. The systematic nature of such extensive and opposing alterations suggests that single-cell properties are significantly influenced by homeostatic mechanisms in hyperexcitable circuits."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Mossy cells give rise to the commissural and associational pathway of the dentate gyrus, and receive their major excitatory inputs from the mossy fibers of granule cells.

Following tetanic stimulation, mossy fiber synapses showed significant NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation (LTP), associated with increased excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) amplitude and decreased failure rates. Coefficient of variance and failure rate analyses suggested a presynaptic locus of LTP induction. Mossy fiber synapses on mossy cells also showed activity-dependent short-term modification properties, including both frequency-dependent facilitation (stimuli at higher frequencies evoked larger EPSCs with lower failure rates) and burst facilitation (each EPSC in a burst had a larger amplitude and higher probability of occurrence than the preceding EPSCs within the burst).

Whether loss is primarily due to excision of random length DNA fragments or the inactivation of one gene at a time is controversial.

We characterize the collapse over time through the distribution of runs of reduced paralog pairs in duplicated segments. Descendant genomes of the same WGD event behave as replicates. Choice of paralog pairs to be reduced is random except for some resistant regions of contiguous pairs. For those paralog pairs that are reduced, conserved copies tend to concentrate on one chromosome.CONCLUSIONS: Both the contiguous regions of reduction-resistant pairs and the concentration of runs of single copy genes on a single chromosome are evidence of transcriptional co-regulation, dosage sensitivity or other functional interaction constraining the reduction process.

Nonetheless, infliximab and adalimumab are the only biological agents that have been approved for this group of patients. In Crohn's disease, exclusive enteral nutrition is the treatment of first choice for inducing a remission. Patients with (peri-)anal fistulae are treated primarily with infliximab. Corticosteroids and aminosalicylates should be used with caution. In contrast, children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis are treated with either aminosalicylates or prednisolone to induce a remission. As a rule, maintenance pharmacotherapy with thiopurines in Crohn's disease and severe ulcerative colitis, or with aminosalicylates in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, is indicated for several years, at least until the end of puberty. Patients with refractory disease courses are treated with methylprednisolone, anti-TNF-α-antibodies, and/or calcineurin inhibitors. The spectrum of surgical interventions is the same as for adults. Specific aspects of the treatment of children and adolescents with IBD include adverse drug effects, the areas of nutrition, growth, and development, and the structured transition to adult medicine.CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents with IBD or suspected IBD should be cared for by pediatric gastroenterologists in a center where such care is provided.

Those participants who had ever self-reported clinician-diagnosed depression or regular use of antidepressants, or had a Mental Health Inventory score of ≤ 52 were excluded. In 2008, we retrospectively asked participants if they had ever received a physician's diagnosis of psoriasis or PsA. We defined depression as self-report of clinician-diagnosed depression or regular use of antidepressant medication. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate age and multivariate-adjusted relative risks (RRs) of clinical depression.RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates including body mass index, physical activity, smoking and the presence of major chronic conditions, the multivariate-adjusted RRs of clinical depression were 1·29 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1·10-1·52] for women with psoriasis and 1·52 (95% CI 1·06-2·19) for women with psoriasis and concomitant PsA, compared with women without psoriasis.CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased risk of depression in US women with psoriasis compared with those without psoriasis.

The impact of comorbidities (psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression) on relative importance scores of each attribute was assessed by analyses of variance, post hoc test, and multivariate regression analysis.RESULTS: Among the participants included (58.9% males, mean age 49.3 yrs), 27% suffered from psoriatic arthritis, 13.5% from cardiovascular disease, 8% from diabetes, and 12.9% from depression. Preferences for treatment attributes varied significantly depending on comorbidities. Participants with psoriatic arthritis cared most about the probability of benefit (β 0.166; P = .037), whereas those participants with cardiovascular disease were highly concerned about the probability of side effects (β 0.179; P = .046).

These results suggest that polyadenylation inhibitor blocked pig oocyte maturation in vitro by one or more of the following actions: (1) inactivation of MAPK and MPF in oocytes, especially at the late stages (MI and MII); (2) prevention of cumulus cell expansion through inactivation of cellular MAPK; and (3) inhibition of the maternal mRNA polyadenylation process, which in reverse, disrupted the maternal mRNA patterns in pig oocytes' maturation in vitro."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Thus, polyadenylation seems to be a major component of the RNA editing machinery that affects overlapping genes in animal mitochondria.", "answer_start": 923}], "question": "Is polyadenylation a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule?", "id": "5a8714e261bb38fb24000005_016", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In the chicken mitochondrial genome, the gene for tRNA(Tyr) overlaps by one nucleotide with the downstream tRNA(Cys) gene, which is located on the same strand.

When cDNA clones of circularized forms of the tRNA(Tyr) are analyzed, the discriminator nucleotide is an adenosine residue rather than the genomically encoded guanosine. Thus, the tRNA(Tyr) is subjected to an RNA editing activity similar to that shown to exist in the mitochondria of two other animal species. Interestingly, some cDNA clones have several adenosine residues at their 3'-ends instead of the expected CCA-sequence.

The structure and dynamics of this domain were investigated to begin elucidating the role Symplekin plays in mRNA maturation. The crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Symplekin HEAT domain was determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.

As phosphorylases, these enzymes use diphosphate nucleotides as substrates and can reversibly polymerize or degrade RNA, depending on the relative concentrations of nucleotides and inorganic phosphate. A possible scenario, illustrating the evolution of RNA polyadenylation and its related functions, is presented, in which PNPase (or the archaeal exosome) was the first polyadenylating enzyme to evolve and the heteropolymeric tails that it produced, functioned in a polyadenylation-stimulated RNA degradation pathway. Only at a later stage in evolution, did the poly(A)-polymerases that use only ATP as a substrate, hence producing homopolymeric adenosine extensions, arise. Following the appearance of homopolymeric tails, a new role for polyadenylation evolved; RNA stability. This was accomplished by utilizing stable poly(A)-tails associated with the mature 3' ends of transcripts.

Significantly, oligo(G) and oligo(U) tails were unable to stimulate degradation; for oligo(G), at least, this is probably due to the formation of a G quartet structure which makes the 3'-end inaccessible.

In up to 90% of cases, they are characterized by activating mutations in the KIT or the PDGFRA gene. GIST represent a paradigm for successful targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Since the approval of the TKI imatinib in 2002 the survival of patients with metastatic GIST has tripled. The next logical step was the concept of using imatinib in an adjuvant approach, which was recently shown to increase overall survival significantly. In both settings, the mutational status has high predictive implications. In detail, GIST with KIT exon 11 mutations show the best response rates with partial remission rates of up to 80%. In KIT exon 9 mutations, a doubled daily dose of 800 mg imatinib is now standard. The PDGFRA exon 18 mutation D842V has been shown to lead to primary resistance. The treatment strategy in GIST is driven by their molecular characterisation. Further research has increased our knowledge on resistance mechanisms in solid tumors against TKI. The number of patients with secondary resistance due to acquired KIT mutations is increasing with treatment duration. Strategies to address this situation are the introduction of novel pathway inhibitors targeting different levels of signal transduction pathways, such as the mTOR/Akt pathway, the RAS/RAF pathway, histone deacetylation, among others. Among the GIST without mutations in the common hot spot regions of KIT and PDGFRA, the so-called wildtype GIST, further genomic subgroups have been identified. One such subgroup carries inactivating germline mutations in the genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase B, C, or D. They are associated with the occurrence of paragangliomas, so-called Carney-Stratakis syndrome. Most frequently, these GIST are located in the stomach, showing an epithelioid phenotype and a multinodular growth pattern. They preferentially occur in young females and often show lymph node metastases, the latter being very unusual in sporadic GIST. In sporadic Carney's triad additional pulmonary chondromas are observed and there are no SDH mutations. Another small subgroup of sporadic GIST present with BRAF mutations as an alternative genomic event. Finally, very rare kindreds with germline mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA have been described who develop multiple GIST and depending on the mutational subtype mastocytosis, hyperpigmentation and/or dysphagia.

The presence of cardiovascular risk factors was not associated with dropout but was associated with nonadherence.

General practices were assigned by computer-generated randomization to 6-year nurse-led, multidomain intensive vascular care or standard care. Of 3526 preDIVA participants, 195 nondemented participants with a systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg were consecutively recruited to undergo magnetic resonance imaging at 2 to 3 and 5 to 6 years after baseline.

Annual WMH volume increase in milliliter was similar for intervention (mean=0.73, SD=0.84) and control (mean=0.70, SD=0.59) participants (adjusted mean difference, -0.08 mL; 95% confidence interval, -0.30 to 0.15; P=0.50).

Unlike oral antidiabetic drugs from several other classes, the efficacy of dapagliflozin is independent of insulin secretion and action. Therefore, when used in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, dapagliflozin provides complementary therapy via its unique mechanism of action. A consistent finding across phase III, randomized, double-blind trials in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes was that dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg/day for 24 weeks as monotherapy in previously untreated patients, or as add-on combination therapy with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone or insulin-based therapy, significantly reduced both glycosylated haemoglobin values (primary endpoint) and fasting plasma glucose levels compared with placebo. Various randomized trials have also shown improvements in postprandial blood glucose with dapagliflozin monotherapy and combination therapy compared with placebo. In addition, dapagliflozin was noninferior to glipizide, in terms of glycaemic control after 52 weeks, when used as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes that was inadequately controlled with metformin. In most clinical trials, dapagliflozin was associated with reductions in body weight that were statistically superior to placebo or active comparators. Longer-term extension studies indicate that the efficacy of dapagliflozin is maintained for up to ≈2 years. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of 24 or 52 weeks duration and in extension studies of up to ≈2 years. Events suggestive of genital infections and urinary tract infections occurred more frequently among dapagliflozin than placebo recipients.

Dapagliflozin has a low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia, especially when used alone or in combination with metformin, although the incidence of hypoglycaemic events reported with dapagliflozin in clinical trials varied depending on the background therapy.

This study explores the molecular interactions between AChE and SGLT2 with a new US Food and Drug Administration approved antidiabetic drug Forxiga (dapagliflozin) to explore a possible link between the treatments of AD and diabetes. Docking study was performed using \"Autodock4.2.\" Hydrophobic and cation-π interactions play an important role in the correct positioning of dapagliflozin within the catalytic site (CAS) of SGLT2 and AChE enzymes to permit docking. Free energy of binding (ΔG) of \"dapagliflozin-SGLT2\" and \"dapagliflozin-CAS domain of AChE\" interactions was found to be -6.25 and -6.28 kcal/mol, respectively. Hence, dapagliflozin might act as a potent dual inhibitor of SGLT2 and AChE. The results described herein may form the basis of future dual therapy against diabetes-associated neurological disorders."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We describe a patient with Doege-Potter syndrome (solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura presenting with hypoglycemia) and illustrate several important lessons learned from the case.

Metataxonomics tools analyze high-throughput sequencing data, primarily from 16S rRNA gene sequencing and DNAseq, to identify microorganisms and viruses within a complex mixture. With the growing demand for analysis of the functional microbiome, metatranscriptome studies attract more interest. To make metatranscriptomic data sufficient for metataxonomics, new analytical workflows are needed to deal with sparse and taxonomically less informative sequencing data.RESULTS: We present a new protocol, IMSA+A, for accurate taxonomy classification based on metatranscriptome data of any read length that can efficiently and robustly identify bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the same sample. The new protocol improves accuracy by using a conservative reference database, employing a new counting scheme, and by assembling shotgun reads. Assembly also reduces analysis runtime. Simulated data were utilized to evaluate the protocol by permuting common experimental variables. When applied to the real metatranscriptome data for mouse intestines colonized by ASF, the protocol showed superior performance in detection of the microorganisms compared to the existing metataxonomics tools. IMSA+A is available at https://github.com/JeremyCoxBMI/IMSA-A .CONCLUSIONS: The developed protocol addresses the need for taxonomy classification from RNAseq data. Previously not utilized, i.e., unmapped to a reference genome, RNAseq reads can now be used to gather taxonomic information about the microbiota present in a biological sample without conducting additional sequencing. Any metatranscriptome pipeline that includes assembly of reads can add this analysis with minimal additional cost of compute time.

In neutrophils, the lowest CPE concentration significantly reduced free radical production in overweight/obese group only, and higher CPE concentrations were effective in both groups. In monocytes, the CPE concentration that was significantly effective in reducing free radical production was lower in overweight/obese subjects than in normo-weight subjects. Chocolate polyphenol extracts inhibit oxidative burst in human neutrophils and monocytes with a higher efficiency in subjects characterized by an unphysiological oxidative/inflammatory stress, such as overweight and obese. Results of this study provide further evidence about a differential role of dietary antioxidant strictly related to the \"stress\" condition of the subjects."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "A number of studies have shown that dietary polyphenols exert a protective effect against hypertension, dyslipidemias, inflammation, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, conditions associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease.", "answer_start": 284}], "question": "Is the consumption of chocolate associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease?", "id": "5aa304f1d6d6b54f79000004_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The chemical structure of polyphenols consisting of aromatic rings, capable of quenching free radicals, makes them ideal candidates to protect against oxidation.

We aimed to examine the prospective associations between chocolate consumption and risk of stroke among men and women in a large population-based cohort.METHODS: A total of 38,182 men and 46,415 women aged 44-76 years, and free of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer at baseline in 1995 and 1998, were followed up until the end of 2009 and 2010, respectively. We obtained data on chocolate consumption for each participant using a self-administrated food frequency questionnaire that included 138 food and beverage items. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke in relation to chocolate consumption.RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12.9 years, we identified 3558 incident strokes cases (2146 cerebral infarctions and 1396 hemorrhagic strokes). After adjustment for age, body mass index, life styles, dietary intakes, and other risk factors, chocolate consumption was associated with a significant lower risk of stroke in women (HR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-0.99). However, the association in men was not significant (HR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.80-1.10). In addition, the association did not vary by stroke subtypes in either men or women.CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this large Japanese cohort supported a significant inverse association between chocolate consumption and risk of developing stroke in women.

The antioxidant effects of flavonoids in tea (including preventing oxidative damage to LDL) are among the potential mechanisms that could underlie the protective effects. Other possible mechanisms include attenuating the inflammatory process in atherosclerosis, reducing thrombosis, promoting normal endothelial function, and blocking expression of cellular adhesion molecules. Cocoa and chocolate can also be rich sources of flavonoids. Flavanols and procyanidins isolated from cocoa exhibit strong antioxidant properties in-vitro. In acute feeding studies, flavanol-rich cocoa and chocolate increased plasma antioxidant capacity and reduced platelet reactivity. Based on limited data, approximately 150 mg of flavonoids is needed to trigger a rapid antioxidant effect and changes in prostacyclin. Some dose-response evidence demonstrates an antioxidant effect with approximately 500 mg flavonoids. Brewed tea typically contains approximately 172 mg total flavonoids per 235 ml (brewed for 2 min); hence, consumption of 1 and 3.5 cups of tea would be expected to elicit acute and chronic physiologic effects, respectively.

Two hours before each testing session, participants were randomly assigned to consume high or poor flavanol chocolate bars. During the tests were evaluated, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task and a working memory task, office SBP and DBP, flow-mediated dilation and pulse-wave velocity.RESULTS: Sleep deprivation increased SBP/DBP.

In developed countries, most cases of WE have been seen in alcohol misusers. Other reported causes are gastrointestinal tract surgery, hyperemesis gravidarum, chronic malnutrition, prolonged total parenteral nutrition without thiamine supplementation, and increased nutrient requirements as in trauma or septic shock. WE is a well-known postoperative complication of gastric restrictive surgery for morbid obesity, after which patients often experience protracted nausea and vomiting, leading to malnutrition and massive weight loss.PRESENTATION OF CASE: This case report concerns WE occurring in a patient who underwent Roux-en-Y subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and subsequently experienced neurological symptoms that proved irreversible probably due to the lengthy time elapsing between their clinical presentation and the diagnosis of WE.DISCUSSION: There have been some reports of WE occurring after total or subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer in non-obese patients with no history of alcoholism, but monitoring for WE has yet to be recommended in the clinical guidelines in this setting (as it has for bariatric surgery). Because of its rarity and variable clinical presentation, WE is often under-diagnosed and under-treated, and confused with other neurological problems.CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for the specific guidelines to take into account not only the neoplastic follow-up of such patients, but also the possible side effects of necessary surgery, since this could help to ensure the timely diagnosis and management of WE in this setting, and to avoid, when possible, claims for medical malpractice that may cause enormous costs both in economical and professional terms.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

After a gastrointestinal infection, she developed depression, memory loss, disorientation, behavioral changes, and ataxic paraplegia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral alterations in thalamic, frontal, and periaqueductal regions, suggestive of WE. The second patient was a man who lost 10 kg after surgical gastrectomy; he developed diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, lower limb paresthesias, and amnesia. A brain MRI demonstrated contrast enhancement of mammillary bodies, compatible with WE.OUTCOME: The patients were treated with intramuscular (IM) thiamine (1200 mg/d for 2 months and 900 mg/d for a month, respectively) with gradual cognitive and behavioral improvement and brain MRI normalization, while ataxia and oculomotion improved in following months. In both patients, thiamine was gradually reduced to IM 200 mg/d and continued for a year, without clinical relapses.CONCLUSIONS: There is no consensus about dosage, frequency, route, and duration of thiamine administration in WE treatment. Based on our cases, we recommend treating patients with WE with higher doses of IM thiamine for a longer time than suggested (900-1200 mg/d for 1-2 months, in our cases) and to gradually reduce dosage after clinical and radiological improvement, maintaining IM 200 mg/d dosage for at least 1 year.© 2016 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute neuropsychiatric disease with heterogeneous symptoms, including changes in mental status, ataxia and ocular abnormalities; if left untreated, these symptoms can lead to morbidity and even to mortality.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "List 3 symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy.", "id": "5a981bcffcd1d6a10c00002d_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute neuropsychiatric disease with heterogeneous symptoms, including changes in mental status, ataxia and ocular abnormalities; if left untreated, these symptoms can lead to morbidity and even to mortality.

Wernicke's encephalopathy results from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Common causes include alcoholism and gastric disorders. Wernicke's has been described in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); however, given these patients' immunosuppressed state, the diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy is not apparent.CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old previously healthy male presented to the ER complaining of progressive dyspnea. Workup revealed HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia. He was treated and improved. On day 14 he became confused and developed nystagmus and ataxia. Considering his immunocompromised state, infectious and neoplastic etiologies topped the differential diagnosis. CT head was negative. Lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Brain MRI revealed increased T2 signal in the medial thalamus bilaterally. Intravenous thiamine was administered resulting in resolution of symptoms.DISCUSSION: The classic triad of Wernicke's encephalopathy occurs in 10% of cases. When immunosuppressed patients develop acute neurologic symptoms infectious or neoplastic etiologies must be excluded. However, given the relative safety of thiamine supplementation, there should be a low threshold for initiating therapy in order to reverse the symptoms and prevent progression to Korsakoff dementia, which is permanent."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Wernicke encephalopathy is a severe neurologic disorder that results from a dietary vitamin B1 deficiency.

It is characterized by changes in consciousness, ocular abnormalities, and ataxia. This study was undertaken to analyze and compare findings on MR imaging and neurologic symptoms at clinical presentations of patients with Wernicke encephalopathy with and without a history of alcohol abuse.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicenter study group retrospectively reviewed MR brain imaging findings, clinical histories, and presentations of 26 patients (14 female, 12 male) diagnosed between 1999 and 2006 with Wernicke encephalopathy. The age range was 6-81 years (mean age, 46 .6+/-19 years).RESULTS: Fifty percent of the patients had a history of alcohol abuse, and 50% had no history of alcohol abuse. Eighty percent showed changes in consciousness, 77% had ocular symptoms, and 54% had ataxia. Only 38% of the patients showed the classic triad of the disease at clinical presentation. At MR examination, 85% of the patients showed symmetric lesions in the medial thalami and the periventricular region of the third ventricle, 65% in the periaqueductal area, 58% in the mamillary bodies, 38% in the tectal plate, and 8% in the dorsal medulla. Contrast enhancement of the mamillary bodies was statistically positively correlated with the alcohol abuse group.CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the usefulness of MR in reaching a prompt diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy to avoid irreversible damage to brain tissue. Contrast enhancement in the mamillary bodies is a typical finding of the disease in the alcoholic population."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a neurologic disorder characterized by clinical symptoms, such as nystagmus, ataxia, and mental confusion.

We hypothesized that in cases with AD pathology, structural changes in dendritic spines would distinguish individuals who had or did not have clinical dementia.METHODS: We compared dendritic spines within layer II and III pyramidal neuron dendrites in Brodmann area 46 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using the Golgi-Cox technique in 12 age-matched pathology-free controls, 8 controls with AD pathology (CAD), and 21 AD cases. We used highly optimized methods to trace impregnated dendrites from bright-field microscopy images that enabled accurate 3-dimensional digital reconstruction of dendritic structure for morphologic analyses.RESULTS: Spine density was similar among control and CAD cases but was reduced significantly in AD. Thin and mushroom spines were reduced significantly in AD compared to CAD brains, whereas stubby spine density was decreased significantly in CAD and AD compared to controls. Increased spine extent distinguished CAD cases from controls and AD. Linear regression analysis of all cases indicated that spine density was not associated with neuritic plaque score but did display negative correlation with Braak staging.INTERPRETATION: These observations provide cellular evidence to support the hypothesis that dendritic spine plasticity is a mechanism of cognitive resilience that protects older individuals with AD pathology from developing dementia.

Resilience metrics were defined at baseline by examining the residuals when regressing brain aging outcomes (hippocampal volume and cognition) on CSF biomarkers. A positive residual reflected better outcomes than expected for a given level of pathology (high resilience). Residuals were integrated into a latent variable model of resilience and validated by testing their ability to independently predict diagnostic conversion, cognitive decline, and the rate of ventricular dilation.RESULTS: Latent variables of resilience predicted a decreased risk of conversion (hazard ratio < 0.54, p < 0.0001), slower cognitive decline (β > 0.02, p < 0.001), and slower rates of ventricular dilation (β < -4.7, p < 2 × 10-15). These results were significant even when analyses were restricted to clinically normal individuals. Furthermore, resilience metrics interacted with biomarker status such that biomarker-positive individuals with low resilience showed the greatest risk of subsequent decline.CONCLUSIONS: Robust phenotypes of resilience calculated by leveraging AD biomarkers and baseline brain aging outcomes provide insight into which individuals are at greatest risk of short-term decline.

Further investigation of four independent cohorts of European ancestry revealed the protective effect of the CASP7 variant against AD is most significant in homozygous APOE ε4 allele carriers. Meta analysis of multiple datasets shows overall odds ratio = 0.45 (p = 0.004). Analysis of RNA sequencing derived gene expression data indicated the variant correlates with reduced caspase 7 expression in multiple brain tissues we examined.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that caspase 7 plays a key role in microglial activation driving neuro-degeneration during AD pathogenesis, and may explain the underlying genetic mechanisms that anti-inflammatory interventions in AD show greater benefit in APOE ε4 carriers than non-carriers.

Cases were identified though a state death certificate search, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, or investigations for undiagnosed neurologic disease. Measles detection in CSF was performed by serology at the California Department of Public Health or at clinical laboratories.Results: Seventeen SSPE cases were identified. Males outnumbered females 2.4:1. Twelve (71%) cases had a history of measles-like illness; all 12 had illness prior to 15 months of age. Eight (67%) children were exposed to measles in California. SSPE was diagnosed at a median age of 12 years (3-35 years), with a latency period of 9.5 years (2.5-34 years). Among measles cases reported to CDPH during 1988-1991, the incidence of SSPE was 1:1367 for children <5 years, and 1:609 for children <12 months at time of measles disease.Conclusions: SSPE cases in California occurred at a high rate among unvaccinated children, particularly those infected during infancy. Protection of unvaccinated infants requires avoidance of travel to endemic areas, or early vaccination prior to travel at age 6-11 months.

We observed that all known SSPE viruses have residues P64, E89, and A209 (PEA) in their M proteins whereas the equivalent residues for vaccine strains are either S64, K89, and T209 (SKT) as in Moraten or PKT.

Several hypotheses are advanced to explain these events. Further studies are needed, however, to develop a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases.

We report a series of 22 SSPE cases presenting between November 2007 and July 2009 in Madang Province, PNG, including localized clusters with the highest ever reported annual incidence.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: as part of a prospective observational study of severe childhood illness at Modilon Hospital, the provincial referral center, children presenting with evidence of meningo-encephalitis were assessed in detail including lumbar puncture in most cases. A diagnosis of SSPE was based on clinical features and presence of measles-specific IgG in cerebrospinal fluid and/or plasma. The estimated annual SSPE incidence in Madang province was 54/million population aged <20 years, but four sub-districts had an incidence >100/million/year. The distribution of year of birth of the 22 children with SSPE closely matched the reported annual measles incidence in PNG, including a peak in 2002.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SSPE follows measles infections in very young PNG children.

Therefore, SSPE registries and routine measles immunization were established in many countries concurrently. We conducted a comprehensive review of the impact of measles immunization on the epidemiology of SSPE and examined epidemiological evidence on whether there was any vaccine-associated risk.METHODS: Published epidemiological data on SSPE, national SSPE incidence, measles incidence and vaccine coverage, reports of SSPE in pregnancy or shortly post partum were reviewed. Potential adverse relationships between measles vaccines and SSPE were examined using available data.RESULTS: Epidemiological data showed that successful measles immunization programmes protect against SSPE and, consistent with virological data, that measles vaccine virus does not cause SSPE. Measles vaccine does not: accelerate the course of SSPE; trigger SSPE or cause SSPE in those with an established benign persistent wild measles infection. Evidence points to wild virus causing SSPE in cases which have been immunized and have had no known natural measles infection. Perinatal measles infection may result in SSPE with a short onset latency and fulminant course. Such cases are very rare. SSPE during pregnancy appears to be fulminant. Infants born to mothers with SSPE have not been subsequently diagnosed with SSPE themselves.CONCLUSIONS: Successful measles vaccination programmes directly and indirectly protect the population against SSPE and have the potential to eliminate SSPE through the elimination of measles.

This review summarizes reports to date on brainstem involvement in SSPE, including the clinical course of disease, neuroimaging presentations, and guidelines for treatment. A comprehensive literature search was performed for English-language publications with keywords \"subacute sclerosing panencephalitis\" and \"brainstem\" using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database (March 1981-September 2017). Eleven articles focusing on SSPE of the brainstem were included. Predominant brainstem involvement remains uncharacteristic of SSPE, which may lead to misdiagnosis and poor outcome. A number of case reports have demonstrated brainstem involvement associated with other intracranial lesions commonly presenting in later SSPE stages (III and IV). However, brainstem lesions can appear in all stages, independent of higher cortical structures. The varied clinical presentations complicate diagnosis from a neuroimaging perspective. SSPE of the brainstem is a rare but important clinical entity. It may present like canonical SSPE or with unique clinical features such as absence seizures and pronounced ataxia. While SSPE generally progresses to the brainstem, it can also begin with a primary focus of infection in the brainstem.

In addition to yield and quality losses, FHB contaminates cereal grain with mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol, which are harmful to human, animal and ecosystem health. Currently, FHB control is only partially effective due to several intractable problems. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism that regulates gene expression. RNAi has been exploited in the development of new genomic tools that allow the targeted silencing of genes of interest in many eukaryotes. Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) is a transgenic technology used to silence fungal genes in planta during attempted infection and thereby reduces disease levels. HIGS relies on the host plant's ability to produce mobile small interfering RNA molecules, generated from long double-stranded RNA, which are complementary to targeted fungal genes. These molecules are transferred from the plant to invading fungi via an uncharacterised mechanism, to cause gene silencing. Here, we describe recent advances in RNAi-mediated control of plant pathogenic fungi, highlighting the key advantages and disadvantages.

There was a 22% reduction in risk of disease progression with selective VEGFR inhibitors (relative risk 0.78; 95% confidence interval 0.69-0.87) compared with sorafenib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor in all trials, and similar whether the agents were first-line or subsequent therapy. ORR was improved with selective VEGFR inhibitors, with 91% increased odds over sorafenib (odds ratio 1.91; 95% confidence interval 1.35-2.69). Overall survival was similar between groups (relative risk 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.21) and DAE differed only in sensitivity analysis with exclusion of dovitinib (odds ratio 0.62; 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.94). Frequencies of the most common toxicities were overall similar, but differences included more frequent grade 3 or 4 fatigue and less frequent palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia with selective VEGFR therapy.CONCLUSION: Although selective VEGFR inhibitors are associated with similar overall survival as multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, they show significant improvement in progression-free survival, regardless of first-line or later use, and ORR compared with sorafenib. Tolerability due to toxicities is similar.Copyright © 2015 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study was aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for resistance.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A HER2+-trastuzumab sensitive NCI-N87 gastric cancer orthotopic nude mouse model was treated with trastuzumab until resistance emerged. Differentially expressed transcripts between trastuzumab-resistant and sensitive gastric cancer cell lines were annotated for functional interrelatedness by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed in pretreatment versus posttreatment biopsies from gastric cancer patients receiving trastuzumab-based treatments. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: Four NCI-N87 trastuzumab-resistant (N87-TR) cell lines were established. Microarray analysis showed HER2 downregulation, induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and indicated fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) as one of the top upregulated genes in N87-TR cell lines. In vitro, N87-TR cell lines demonstrated a higher sensitivity than did trastuzumab-sensitive parental cells to the FGFR3 inhibitor dovitinib, which reduced expression of pAKT, ZEB1, and cell migration. Oral dovitinib significantly (P = 0.0006) reduced tumor burden and prolonged mice survival duration in N87-TR mouse models.

The current phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of dovitinib, an FGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced SCC of the lung.METHODS: Patients with pretreated advanced SCC of the lung whose tumors demonstrated FGFR1 amplification of > 5 copies by fluorescence in situ hybridization were enrolled. Dovitinib at a dose of 500 mg was administered orally, once daily, on days 1 to 5 of every week, followed by 2 days off. The primary endpoint was overall response. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity.RESULTS: All 26 patients were men with a median age of 68 years (range, 52-80 years). The majority of patients were ever-smokers. The median duration of dovitinib administration (28 days per cycle) was 2.5 months (range, 0.7-8.6 months). The overall response rate was 11.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.8%-23.8%) and the disease control rate was 50% (95% CI, 30.8%-69.2%), with 3 patients achieving partial responses. Response durations for the patients with partial responses were ≥4.5 months, ≥ 5.1 months, and 6.1 months, respectively. After a median follow-up of 15.7 months (range, 1.2-25.6 months), the median overall survival was 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.6-6.4 months) and the median progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.5-4.3 months).

Within the FGFR2(mutant) cell lines, three of seven showed marked resistance to PD173074 and relative resistance to dovitinib and ponatinib.

Pregabalin is effective in the treatment of some types of neuropathic pain. This study examined whether pregabalin may reduce the intensity of sciatica.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in patients with sciatica. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pregabalin at a dose of 150 mg per day that was adjusted to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day or matching placebo for up to 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the leg-pain intensity score on a 10-point scale (with 0 indicating no pain and 10 the worst possible pain) at week 8; the leg-pain intensity score was also evaluated at week 52, a secondary time point for the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the extent of disability, back-pain intensity, and quality-of-life measures at prespecified time points over the course of 1 year.RESULTS: A total of 209 patients underwent randomization, of whom 108 received pregabalin and 101 received placebo; after randomization, 2 patients in the pregabalin group were determined to be ineligible and were excluded from the analyses. At week 8, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.7 in the pregabalin group and 3.1 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.2 to 1.2; P=0.19). At week 52, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.4 in the pregabalin group and 3.0 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.3; 95% CI, -0.5 to 1.0; P=0.46). No significant between-group differences were observed with respect to any secondary outcome at either week 8 or week 52. A total of 227 adverse events were reported in the pregabalin group and 124 in the placebo group.

AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting one-fifth of those aged over 85 years. Recent therapeutic approaches have been strongly influenced by five neuropathological hallmarks of AD: acetylcholine deficiency, glutamate excitotoxicity, extracellular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ plague), formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NTFs), and neuroinflammation. The lowered concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) in AD result in a progressive and significant loss of cognitive and behavioral function. Current AD medications, memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) alleviate some of these symptoms by enhancing cholinergic signaling, but they are not curative. Since 2003, no new drugs have been approved for the treatment of AD. This article focuses on the current research in clinical trials targeting the neuropathological findings of AD including acetylcholine response, glutamate transmission, Aβ clearance, tau protein deposits, and neuroinflammation. These investigations include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, agonists and antagonists of neurotransmitter receptors, β-secretase (BACE) or γ-secretase inhibitors, vaccines or antibodies targeting Aβ clearance or tau protein, as well as anti-inflammation compounds. Ongoing Phase III clinical trials via passive immunotherapy against Aβ peptides (crenezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab) seem to be promising. Using small molecules blocking 5-HT6 serotonin receptor (intepirdine), inhibiting BACE activity (E2609, AZD3293, and verubecestat), or reducing tau aggregation (TRx0237) are also currently in Phase III clinical trials.

At the same time, when in Scandinavia an epidemic by S.pyogenes type 1 with many cases of toxic shock was observed, the same type caused a scarlet fever epidemic without complications in eastern Germany. Erythrogenic toxin type A or its toxoid, respectively, can be used for successful immunizations of rabbits. Another--antibacterial-immunization can be done with the M-protein of S.pyogenes, which is limited by its type-specificity. Streptococcal vaccination is required especially for developing countries with a high incidence of rheumatic fever.

It is important to understand the changes in epidemiology of the diseases caused by the pathogen for improved control of such infections. Hence, the aim of the present study was to carry out an epidemiological analysis of GAS infections in Serbia in a 9-yr period (1991-1999) and evaluation of susceptibility of GAS isolates obtained during the same period to penicillin and erythromycin.METHODS: Occurrence of tonsillopharyngitis, scarlatina and rheumatic fever was analyzed and GAS carrier status in healthy children was examined over a 9-yr period from 1991 to 1999. Susceptibility to penicillin and erythromycin was determined for 1657 GAS isolates obtained from patients diagnosed with pharyngitis or scarlet fever and 512 isolates from healthy carriers. M-type antigen was also determined in these isolates.RESULTS: The average incidences of tonsillopharyngitis and scarlet fever were 76.2 and 30.8 per cent respectively. A total of 166 cases of rheumatic fever were registered. Per cent of carriers varied from 5.5 to 11.4 per cent over the study period. Predominating M serotypes among GAS isolates tested were M1, M3, M4, M6, M11, M12 and M18, depending on the source of clinical material and period of isolation. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed susceptibility to penicillin in all isolates tested and resistance to erythromycin in 2.41 per cent of the isolates.INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Although the fluctuations in incidence were noted during the nine-year period, the incidence of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis is low but with a steady raise in Serbia. No significant changes in the incidence of scarlet fever and rheumatic fever were noted. Susceptibility to penicillin remained unchanged, but the number or erythromycin resistant strains have increased."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Umbilical cord blood (CB) banks usually freeze and store CB for clinical transplantation using conventional controlled-rate freezer or the automated BioArchive system.

Compared with ND group, cardiac specific overexpression of NS by adenovirus (AV) injection significantly restored I/R-induced ribosomal function enhancement, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, improved cardiac function, and decreased infarct sizes in diabetic mice.

There are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive and central. The objective of this review is to provide a broad perspective of the pathophysiological and clinical aspects of the two types of apnea and to discuss their cardiovascular adverse effects. The diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome is based on polysomnography, and severity is measured with an apnea-hypopnea index that counts the total number of apneas per hour of sleep. Recent large epidemiologic studies have shown that sleep apnea affects about 16% of men and 5% of women between 30 and 65 years of age. Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by abnormal collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep, snoring, vigorous inspiratory efforts causing frequent arousal, and excessive daytime drowsiness. Central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a form of periodic breathing with frequent periods of hyperventilation, and carries a poor prognosis in patients with heart failure. Obstructive apnea can also have substantial health consequences. Although the exact mechanism linking sleep apnea with cardiovascular disease is unknown, there is evidence that obstructive apnea is associated with a group of proinflammatory and prothrombic factors that are also important in the development of atherosclerosis. Nocturnal and daytime sympathetic activity is elevated after sleep apnea. Autonomic abnormalities include an increased resting heart rate, decreased cardiac rhythm activity, and increased blood pressure variability. Obstructive apnea is associated with endothelial dysfunction, increased C-reactive protein and cytokine expression, elevated fibrinogen levels and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Enhanced platelet activity and aggregation, leukocyte adhesion and accumulation of endothelial cells are common in both obstructive apnea and atherosclerosis. Surges in sympathetic activity, blood pressure, ventricular wall tension and afterload adversely affect ventricular function. Many studies have shown that patients with obstructive apnea have an increased incidence of daytime hypertension, and this syndrome is recognized as an independent risk factor for hypertension. Obstructive apnea is associated with myocardial ischemia (silent or symptomatic), acute coronary events, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Central sleep apnea is frequent in severe heart failure. Most heart failure patients with pulmonary congestion chronically hyperventilate because of stimulation of vagal irritant receptors and central and peripheral chemosensitivity. When PaCO2 falls below the threshold required to stimulate breathing, the central drive to respiratory muscles and air inflow ceases and central apnea ensues. Apnea, hypoxia, CO2 retention and arousals provoke elevated sympathetic activity, increased afterload and elevated left ventricular transmural pressure, and promote the progression of heart failure. Tentative relationships have been identified between central apnea and markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Recent mid-terms trials showed that nocturnal use of positive airway pressure in patients with the two types of apnea alleviates symptoms, reduces sympathetic activity, improves ventricular function and quality of life, and reduces daytime drowsiness. More studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but clinicians should be aware of this link and should attempt to identify patients with these syndromes."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, affecting 5-15% of the population.

The overnight polysomnography was performed using an EMBLA® S7000 digital system during the regular sleep schedule of the individual. The electrocardiogram channel was extracted, duplicated, and then analyzed using a Holter (Cardio Smart®) system.RESULTS: A total of 767 participants (461 men) with a mean age of 42.00 ± 0.53 years, were included in the analysis. At least one type of nocturnal cardiac rhythm disturbance (atrial/ventricular arrhythmia or beat) was observed in 62.7% of the sample. The occurrence of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias was more frequent with increased disease severity. Rhythm disturbance was observed in 53.3% of the sample without breathing sleep disorders, whereas 92.3% of patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea showed cardiac arrhythmia.

Cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with OSA. However, the prevalence and significance of cardiac arrhythmias in Asian patients with OSA are not well studied. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with OSA in Singapore and to evaluate possible factors that may predispose patients with OSA to arrhythmias.METHODS: A retrospective study of 2,019 patients was carried out from January 2011 to December 2012 at a sleep center in a tertiary medical center. Of the population, 1,457 patients were found to have OSA and 144 patients were found to have cardiac arrhythmias. Data collected included patient demographics, comorbidities, and polysomnogram parameters.RESULTS: The prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias in our OSA population is 8.0%, compared to that of primary snorers at 4.8% (P = .015). The univariate analysis revealed that older age, higher body mass index, comorbidities, and severity of OSA, including apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), lowest oxygen saturation (LSAT) and hypoxic time were correlated with a higher prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias (P < .05). However, the multivariate analysis showed that only age and body mass index were significantly correlated with arrhythmias. AHI, LSAT, and hypoxic time were no longer statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with OSA in Singapore.

Based on data obtained by using extracellular recording techniques, there is a consensus that hypoglossal motoneurons cease to discharge during rapid eye movement sleep, because they are disfacilitated. Since other somatic motoneurons are known to be postsynaptically inhibited during rapid eye movement sleep, we sought to determine, by the use of intracellular recording techniques during cholinergically induced rapid eye movement sleep, whether postsynaptic inhibitory mechanisms act on hypoglossal motoneurons. We found that, during this state, a powerful glycinergic premotor inhibitory system acts to suppress hypoglossal motoneurons. This finding opens new avenues for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and provides a foundation to explore the neural and pharmacological control of respiration-related motoneurons during rapid eye movement sleep."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "osteoclast-mediated attack on bone", "answer_start": 1649}], "question": "Are osteoclasts specialized in bone degradation?", "id": "5aa82180d6d6b54f79000015_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In osteosarcoma, a primary mesenchymal bone cancer occurring predominantly in younger patients, invasive tumour growth leads to extensive bone destruction. This process is insufficiently understood, cannot be efficiently counteracted and calls for novel means of treatment. The endocytic collagen receptor, uPARAP/Endo180, is expressed on various mesenchymal cell types and is involved in bone matrix turnover during normal bone growth. Human osteosarcoma specimens showed strong expression of this receptor on tumour cells, along with the collagenolytic metalloprotease, MT1-MMP. In advanced tumours with ongoing bone degeneration, sarcoma cells positive for these proteins formed a contiguous layer aligned with the degradation zones. Remarkably, osteoclasts were scarce or absent from these regions and quantitative analysis revealed that this scarcity marked a strong contrast between osteosarcoma and bone metastases of carcinoma origin. This opened the possibility that sarcoma cells might directly mediate bone degeneration. To examine this question, we utilized a syngeneic, osteolytic bone tumour model with transplanted NCTC-2472 sarcoma cells in mice. When analysed in vitro, these cells were capable of degrading the protein component of surface-labelled bone slices in a process dependent on MMP activity and uPARAP/Endo180. Systemic treatment of the sarcoma-inoculated mice with a mouse monoclonal antibody that blocks murine uPARAP/Endo180 led to a strong reduction of bone destruction.

Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibitors have been shown to effectively ameliorate pathological fibrotic responses. However, the pharmacological effects and underlying mechanisms of these inhibitors in renal fibrosis remain elusive. In this study, we determined that the inhibition of Brd4, a BET family member, with a selective potent chemical inhibitor, JQ1, could prevent the development of renal fibrosis and block the progression of fibrosis in rats that have undergone unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Inhibiting Brd4 with either JQ1 or genetic knockdown resulted in decreased expression of fibrotic genes such as α-smooth muscle actin, collagen IV and fibronectin both in UUO-induced fibrosis and upon TGF-β1 stimulation in HK-2 cells. Brd4 inhibition also suppressed the oxidative stress induced by UUO in vivo or by TGF-β1 in HK-2 cells. Moreover, Nox4, which is constitutively active in renal cells and is involved in the generation of hydrogen peroxide, was up-regulated during UUO-mediated fibrosis and induced by TGF-β1 in HK-2 cells, and this up-regulation could be blunted by Brd4 inhibition. Consistently, Nox4-mediated ROS generation and fibrotic gene expression were attenuated upon Brd4 inhibition. Further, the transcriptional activity of Nox4 was suppressed by JQ1 or siRNA against Brd4. Additionally, Smad3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which are upstream signals of Nox4 expression, were inhibited both in JQ1-administered UUO rats and Brd4-inhibited HK-2 cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that the inhibition of Brd4 might protect against renal fibrosis by blocking the TGF-β-Nox4-ROS-fibrosis axis, suggesting that Brd4 could be a promising therapeutic target."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients.

In this context, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a highly specialized endothelial cell membrane that lines cerebral microvessels, represents the interface between neural cells and circulating cells of the immune system. The BBB thus plays a key role in the generation and maintenance of chronic inflammation during AD. The BBB operates within the neurovascular unit (NVU), which includes clusters of glial cells, neurons and pericytes. The NVU becomes dysfunctional during AD, and each of its components may undergo functional changes that contribute to neuronal injury and cognitive deficit. In transgenic animals with AD-like pathology, recent studies have shown that circulating leukocytes migrate through the activated brain endothelium when certain adhesion molecules are expressed, penetrating into the brain parenchyma, interacting with the NVU components and potentially affecting their structural integrity and functionality. Therefore, migrating immune system cells in cerebral vessels act in concert with the modified BBB and may be integrated into the dysfunctional NVU. Notably, blocking the adhesion mechanisms controlling leukocyte-endothelial interactions inhibits both Aβ deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, and reduces memory loss in AD models.

Also, ANXA1 was decreased in the bEnd.3 cells, the capillaries of 5XFAD mice, and the human serum of patients with AD.

RhoA inhibitors alleviated Aβ42-induced BBB disruption and constitutively overexpressed RhoA-GTP (active form of RhoA) attenuated the protective effect of ANXA1.

Current evidence indicates that sclerostin likely functions as a local/paracrine regulator of bone metabolism rather than as an endocrine hormone. Nonetheless, circulating sclerostin levels in humans often reflect changes in the bone microenvironment, although there may be exceptions to this observation. Using existing assays, circulating sclerostin levels have been shown to be altered in response to both hormonal stimuli and across a variety of normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In both rodents and humans, parathyroid hormone provided either intermittently or continuously suppresses sclerostin levels. Likewise, most evidence from both human and animal studies supports a suppressive effect of estrogen on sclerostin levels. Efforts to examine non-hormonal/systemic regulation of sclerostin have in general shown less consistent findings or have provided associations rather than direct interventional information, with the exception of mechanosensory studies which have consistently demonstrated increased sclerostin levels with skeletal unloading, and conversely decreases in sclerostin with enhanced skeletal loading.

Dysregulation of sclerostin expression also underlies the pathophysiology of skeletal disorders characterized by loss of bone mass, as well as the damaging effects of some cancers in bone. Thus, sclerostin has quickly become a promising molecular target for the treatment of osteoporosis and other skeletal diseases, and beneficial skeletal outcomes are observed in animal studies and clinical trials using neutralizing antibodies against sclerostin. However, the anabolic effect of blocking sclerostin decreases with time, bone mass accrual is also accompanied by anti-catabolic effects, and there is bone loss over time after therapy discontinuation.

It has recently been shown that osteocyte production of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) is important in osteoclastic bone resorption, and we reported that exogenous treatment of osteocytes with sclerostin can increase RANKL-mediated osteoclast activity. There is good evidence that osteocytes can themselves liberate mineral from bone in a process known as osteocytic osteolysis. In the current study, we investigated sclerostin-stimulated mineral dissolution by human primary osteocyte-like cells (hOCy) and mouse MLO-Y4 cells. We found that sclerostin upregulated osteocyte expression of carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2/Car2), cathepsin K (CTSK/Ctsk), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5/Acp5). Because acidification of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in the release of mineral from bone, we further examined the regulation by sclerostin of CA2. Sclerostin stimulated CA2 mRNA and protein expression in hOCy and in MLO-Y4 cells. Sclerostin induced a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) in both cell types as well as a decrease in extracellular pH (pHo) and the release of calcium ions from mineralized substrate. These effects were reversed in the co-presence of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetozolamide. Car2-siRNA knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells significantly inhibited the ability of sclerostin to both reduce the pHo and release calcium from a mineralized substrate. Knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells of each of the putative sclerostin receptors, Lrp4, Lrp5 and Lrp6, using siRNA, inhibited the sclerostin induction of Car2, Catk and Acp5 mRNA, as well as pHo and calcium release. Consistent with this activity of sclerostin resulting in osteocytic osteolysis, human trabecular bone samples treated ex vivo with recombinant human sclerostin for 7 days exhibited an increased osteocyte lacunar area, an effect that was reversed by the co-addition of acetozolamide.

In the rat MMT model, pharmacologic treatment of animals with either systemic Scl-Ab or IA injection of Scl-Fab had no effect on lesion development or severity.CONCLUSION: Genetic absence of sclerostin does not alter the normal development of age-dependent OA in mice, and pharmacologic inhibition of sclerostin with Scl-Ab has no impact on articular cartilage remodeling in rats with posttraumatic OA.Copyright © 2013 by the American College of Rheumatology."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Sclerostin is a key negative regulator of bone formation", "answer_start": 33}], "question": "Sclerostin regulates what process?", "id": "5a9700adfcd1d6a10c00002c_021", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Sclerostin is a key negative regulator of bone formation. It was hypothesized that sclerostin might also play a potential role in the development of aortic valve calcification (AVC). The study aim was to evaluate serum sclerostin levels in patients with different degrees of AVC compared to a healthy control group, and to investigate local sclerostin expression in explanted calcified and non-calcified aortic valves.METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was performed in 115 patients (mean age 74 +/- 7 years) with echocardiographically proven AVC. Sclerostin serum levels were measured using ELISA and compared to values obtained from a healthy control population. For quantification of AVC, all patients of the study cohort underwent non-contrast-enhanced dual-source computed tomography (DSCT). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for sclerostin and mRNA sclerostin expression was analyzed in 10 calcified aortic valves and 10 non-calcified age-matched control valves.RESULTS: Patients with AVC showed significantly higher sclerostin serum levels as compared to healthy controls (0.94 +/- 0.45 versus 0.58 +/- 0.26 ng/ml, p < 0.001). A significant correlation between sclerostin serum levels and Agatston AVC scores as assessed by DSCT was observed (r = 0.62, p < 0.001) in the study cohort. IHC revealed positive sclerostin staining in nine calcified valves, in contrast to negative staining for sclerostin in all non-calcified valves. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the increased sclerostin expression on mRNA level, with a significant up-regulation of sclerostin mRNA (fold change 150 +/- 52, p < 0.001) expression being shown in calcified aortic valves compared to non-calcified control valves. Co-staining experiments revealed that sclerostin-expressing cells co-express the major osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 and the extracellular matrix protein osteocalcin.CONCLUSION: Patients with AVC showed increased sclerostin serum levels compared to a healthy reference population, and it was revealed that the severity of AVC may be linked to increased sclerostin serum levels. Moreover, the PCR and staining data demonstrated an increased sclerostin expression in parallel to prototypic markers of osteogenic transdifferentiation, indicating a role of sclerostin in the valvular calcification process."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Sclerostin is a product of mature osteocytes embedded in mineralised bone and is a negative regulator of bone mass and osteoblast differentiation", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Sclerostin regulates what process?", "id": "5a9700adfcd1d6a10c00002c_022", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Sclerostin is a product of mature osteocytes embedded in mineralised bone and is a negative regulator of bone mass and osteoblast differentiation. While evidence suggests that sclerostin has an anti-anabolic role, the possibility also exists that sclerostin has catabolic activity. To test this we treated human primary pre-osteocyte cultures, cells we have found are exquisitely sensitive to sclerostin, or mouse osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells, with recombinant human sclerostin (rhSCL) and measured effects on pro-catabolic gene expression. Sclerostin dose-dependently up-regulated the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANKL) mRNA and down-regulated that of osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA, causing an increase in the RANK:OPG mRNA ratio. To examine the effects of rhSCL on resulting osteoclastic activity, MLO-Y4 cells plated onto a bone-like substrate were primed with rhSCL for 3 days and then either mouse splenocytes or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were added. This resulted in cultures with elevated osteoclastic resorption (approximately 7-fold) compared to untreated co-cultures. The increased resorption was abolished by co-addition of recombinant OPG. In co-cultures of MLO-Y4 cells with PBMC, SCL also increased the number and size of the TRAP-positive multinucleated cells formed. Importantly, rhSCL had no effect on TRAP-positive cell formation from monocultures of either splenocytes or PBMC. Further, rhSCL did not induce apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells, as determined by caspase activity assays, demonstrating that the osteoclastic response was not driven by dying osteocytes. Together, these results suggest that sclerostin may have a catabolic action through promotion of osteoclast formation and activity by osteocytes, in a RANKL-dependent manner."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In humans, the SOST gene encodes sclerostin, an inhibitor of bone growth and remodeling, which also negatively regulates the bone repair process.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Sclerostin regulates what process?", "id": "5a9700adfcd1d6a10c00002c_023", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In humans, the SOST gene encodes sclerostin, an inhibitor of bone growth and remodeling, which also negatively regulates the bone repair process.

The pulps of the first maxillary molars were mechanically exposed in 3-mo-old Sost-/- and wild-type (WT) mice ( n = 14 mice per group), capped with mineral trioxide aggregate cement, and the cavities were filled with a bonded composite resin. Reparative dentinogenesis was dynamically followed up by micro-computed tomography and characterized by histological analyses.

At 30 and 49 d postsurgery, a large-forming reparative mineralized bridge, associated with osteopontin-positive mineralization foci, was observed in the Sost-/- pulps, whereas a much smaller bridge was detected in WT. At the longer time points, the bridge, which was associated with dentin sialoprotein-positive cells, had expanded in both groups but remained significantly larger in Sost-/- pulps. Sclerostin expression in the healing WT pulps was detected in the cells neighboring the forming dentin bridge. In vitro, mineralization induced by Sost-/- dental pulp cells (DPCs) was also dramatically enhanced when compared with WT DPCs. These observations were associated with an increased Sost expression in WT cells.

The effects of dialysis modality and the magnitude of the convection volume in haemodiafiltration (HDF) on sScl were also investigated.Methods: In a subset of patients from the CONTRAST study, a randomized controlled trial comparing HDF with HD, sScl was measured at baseline and at intervals of 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Patients were divided into quartiles, according to their baseline sScl. The relation between time-varying sScl and mortality with a 4-year follow-up period was investigated using crude and adjusted Cox regression models. Linear mixed models were used for longitudinal measurements of sScl.Results: The mean (±standard deviation) age of 396 test subjects was 63.6 (±13.9 years), 61.6% were male and the median follow-up was 2.9 years. Subjects with the highest sScl had a lower mortality risk than those with the lowest concentrations [adjusted hazard ratio 0.51 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.31-0.86, P = 0.01)]. Stratified models showed a stable sScl in patients treated with HD (Δ +2.9 pmol/L/year, 95% CI -0.5 to +6.3, P = 0.09) and a decreasing concentration in those treated with HDF (Δ -4.5 pmol/L/year, 95% CI -8.0 to -0.9, P = 0.02). The relative change in the latter group was related to the magnitude of the convection volume.Conclusions: (i) A high sScl is associated with a lower mortality risk in patients with end-stage kidney disease; (ii) treatment with HDF causes sScl to fall; and (iii) the relative decline in patients treated with HDF is dependent on the magnitude of the convection volume.© The Author 2016.

To address this problem, we measured the steady state abundance of 441 human signaling and transcription factor proteins from 68 Yoruba HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines to identify novel relationships between inter-individual protein levels, genetic variants, and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Proteins were measured using micro-western and reverse phase protein arrays from three independent cell line thaws to permit mixed effect modeling of protein biological replicates. We observed enrichment of protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for cellular sensitivity to two commonly used chemotherapeutics: cisplatin and paclitaxel. We functionally validated the target protein of a genome-wide significant trans-pQTL for its relevance in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. GWAS overlap results of drug-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity for paclitaxel and cisplatin revealed unique SNPs associated with the pharmacologic traits (at p<0.001). Interestingly, GWAS SNPs from various regions of the genome implicated the same target protein (p<0.0001) that correlated with drug induced cytotoxicity or apoptosis (p ≤ 0.05). Two genes were functionally validated for association with drug response using siRNA: SMC1A with cisplatin response and ZNF569 with paclitaxel response. This work allows pharmacogenomic discovery to progress from the transcriptome to the proteome and offers potential for identification of new therapeutic targets.

To quantify the protein abundance, a list of proteins must be firstly inferred from the raw data. Then the relative or absolute protein abundance is estimated with quantification methods, such as spectral counting. Until now, most researchers have been dealing with these two processes separately. In fact, the protein inference problem can be regarded as a special protein quantification problem in the sense that truly present proteins are those proteins whose abundance values are not zero. Some recent published papers have conceptually discussed this possibility. However, there is still a lack of rigorous experimental studies to test this hypothesis. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem. Protein inference methods aim to determine whether each candidate protein is present in the sample or not. Protein quantification methods estimate the abundance value of each inferred protein. Naturally, the abundance value of an absent protein should be zero. Thus, we argue that the protein inference problem can be viewed as a special protein quantification problem in which one protein is considered to be present if its abundance is not zero. Based on this idea, our paper tries to use three simple protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem effectively. The experimental results on six data sets show that these three methods are competitive with previous protein inference algorithms. This demonstrates that it is plausible to model the protein inference problem as a special protein quantification task, which opens the door of devising more effective protein inference algorithms from a quantification perspective.

In this model, we use a transformation of the joint probability that each peptide/protein pair is present in the sample as the variable. Then, both the peptide probability and protein probability can be expressed as a formula in terms of the linear combination of these variables. Based on this simple fact, the protein inference problem is formulated as an optimization problem: minimize the number of proteins with non-zero probabilities under the constraint that the difference between the calculated peptide probability and the peptide probability generated from peptide identification algorithms should be less than some threshold.

The relative risk for Ebstein's anomaly among such children was estimated to be 400 on the basis of data collected from a registry of voluntarily submitted cases.

No women who took lithium during pregnancy were found among four case-control studies of Ebstein's anomaly involving 25, 34, 59, and 89 affected children, respectively.

One blood feeding is necessary for the tick to acquire the infection from an infected host and the next feeding is needed to transmit the bacterium to a naïve host. We have developed a model for E. chaffeensis transmission that eliminates the entire tick acquisition stage while still producing high numbers of infected ticks that are also able to transmit infections to naïve hosts.

To investigate the mechanism by which DEP leads to increased UBQLN protein levels, we identified and interrogated microRNAs that were predicted to regulate UBQLN mRNA.

The analysis of more than six hundred sequences allowed characterizing ubiquilin diversity in all the main eukaryotic groups. Many organisms (e. g. fungi, many animals) have single ubiquilin genes, but duplications in animal, plant, alveolate and excavate species are described. Seven different ubiquilins have been detected in vertebrates. Two of them, here called UBQLN5 and UBQLN6, had not been hitherto described. Significantly, marsupial and eutherian mammals have the most complex ubiquilin gene families, composed of up to 6 genes. This exceptional mammalian-specific expansion is the result of the recent emergence of four new genes, three of them (UBQLN3, UBQLN5 and UBQLNL) with precise testis-specific expression patterns that indicate roles in the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis. A gene with related features has independently arisen in species of the Drosophila genus.

We found that temperature had a significant impact on H. halys 'probing' behavior and may influence periodicity of activity. Our data suggest that the minimal temperature at which 'probing' of H. halys occurs is between 3.5 and 6.1 °C (95% CI), and that 'probing' does not occur at temperatures above 26.5 to 29.6 °C (95% CI).

A 2-yr trapping study suggested that H. halys began to respond reliably to pheromone-baited traps after a critical photoperiod of 13.5 h in the spring. Captures before that point were not correlated with visual counts of bugs in buildings despite robust populations, suggesting currently available pheromone-baited traps were ineffective for surveillance of diapausing H. halys. Finally, because baited traps captured only 8-20% of the adult H. halys known to be present per location, they were not an effective indoor management tool for overwintering H. halys.

Simulated changes in seasonal phenology and voltinism were examined. Under the possible future climate scenarios, suitable range in Europe expands northward.

Studies show that curli contributes most significantly to biofilm formation. Expression of Vi antigen decreased biofilm formation in vitro and virulence and bacterial survival in vivo without altering the examined gallbladder pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines. Oppositely, loss of all ECM components (ΔwcaM ΔcsgA ΔyihO ΔbcsE) increased virulence and bacterial survival in vivo and reduced gallbladder interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels.

The firstline treatment is a combination therapy of oral nifurtimox and intravenous eflornithine that needs to be administered in a hospital setting by trained personnel, which is not optimal given that patients often live in remote areas with few health resources. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral regimen of fexinidazole (a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole with proven trypanocidal activity) versus nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in patients with late-stage g-HAT.METHODS: In this randomised, phase 2/3, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we recruited patients aged 15 years and older with late-stage g-HAT from g-HAT treatment centres in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (n=9) and the Central African Republic (n=1). Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either fexinidazole or nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy according to a predefined randomisation list (block size six). The funder, data management personnel, and study statisticians were masked to treatment. Oral fexinidazole was given once a day (days 1-4: 1800 mg, days 5-10: 1200 mg). Oral nifurtimox was given three times a day (days 1-10: 15 mg/kg per day) with eflornithine twice a day as 2 h infusions (days 1-7: 400 mg/kg per day). The primary endpoint was success at 18 months (ie, deemed as patients being alive, having no evidence of trypanosomes in any body fluid, not requiring rescue medication, and having a cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count ≤20 cells per μL). Safety was assessed through routine monitoring. Primary efficacy analysis was done in the modified intention-to-treat population and safety analyses in the intention-to-treat population. The acceptable margin for the difference in success rates was defined as 13%. This study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01685827.FINDINGS: Between October, 2012, and November, 2016, 419 patients were pre-screened. Of the 409 eligible patients, 14 were not included because they did not meet all inclusion criteria (n=12) or for another reason (n=2). Therefore, 394 patients were randomly assigned, 264 to receive fexinidazole and 130 to receive nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy. Success at 18 months was recorded in 239 (91%) patients given fexinidazole and 124 (98%) patients given nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy, within the margin of acceptable difference of -6·4% (97·06% CI -11·2 to -1·6; p=0·0029). We noted no difference in the proportion of patients who experienced treatment-related adverse events (215 [81%] in the fexinidazole group vs 102 [79%] in the nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy group). Treatment discontinuations were unrelated to treatment (n=2 [1%] in the fexinidazole group). Temporary nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy interruption occurred in three (2%) patients. 11 patients died during the study (nine [3%] in the fexinidazole group vs two [2%] in the nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy group).INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that oral fexinidazole is effective and safe for the treatment of T b gambiense infection compared with nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in late-stage HAT patients.

Relatively more intensive scenarios incorporate vector control. New tools considered include tiny targets for tsetse fly control, use of rapid diagnostic tests and oral treatment with fexinidazole or oxaboroles.

The T. cruzi strains used in the study were previously characterized in murine models as susceptible (CL strain), partially resistant (Y strain), and resistant (Colombian and VL-10 strains) to the drugs currently in clinical use, benznidazole and nifurtimox. Our results demonstrated that fexinidazole was effective in suppressing parasitemia and preventing death in infected animals for all strains tested. In addition, assessment of definitive parasite clearance (cure) through parasitological, PCR, and serological methods showed cure rates of 80.0% against CL and Y strains, 88.9% against VL-10 strain, and 77.8% against Colombian strain among animals treated during acute phase, and 70% (VL-10 strain) in those treated in chronic phase. Benznidazole had a similar effect against susceptible and partially resistant T. cruzi strains.

Foxp3Δ2-expressing Tregs coexpressed CD161, a marker commonly associated with the Th17 linage, significantly more often than full-length Foxp3-expressing Tregs. Compared with those of HCs, GCA-derived Tregs demonstrated impaired suppressor capacity. Treatment with TCZ, in contrast to CS therapy, corrected the Treg abnormalities observed in aGCA. In addition, TCZ treatment increased the numbers of activated Tregs (CD45RA-Foxp3high) and the Treg expression of markers of trafficking (CCR4) and terminal differentiation (CTLA-4).CONCLUSIONS: TCZ may exert its therapeutic effects in GCA by increasing the proliferation and activation of Tregs, and by reverting the pathogenic Treg phenotype seen during active disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The effect of the interleukin-6 receptor alpha inhibitor tocilizumab on the rates of relapse during glucocorticoid tapering was studied in patients with giant-cell arteritis.METHODS: In this 1-year trial, we randomly assigned 251 patients, in a 2:1:1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous tocilizumab (at a dose of 162 mg) weekly or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper, or placebo combined with a prednisone taper over a period of either 26 weeks or 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of sustained glucocorticoid-free remission at week 52 in each tocilizumab group as compared with the rate in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week prednisone taper. The key secondary outcome was the rate of remission in each tocilizumab group as compared with the placebo group that underwent the 52-week prednisone taper. Dosing of prednisone and safety were also assessed.RESULTS: Sustained remission at week 52 occurred in 56% of the patients treated with tocilizumab weekly and in 53% of those treated with tocilizumab every other week, as compared with 14% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week prednisone taper and 18% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 52-week prednisone taper (P<0.001 for the comparisons of either active treatment with placebo).

Recently, efforts have been made to overcome the shortcomings of the ACR criteria. The lack of an accepted definition of disease activity in large-vessel vasculitides presents a major challenge in creating useful and valid outcome tools for the assessment of disease course. Identification of predictors of flares can aid in optimizing therapeutic strategies, minimizing disease flares, and reducing treatment-related side effects. It is furthermore important to recognize and characterize the risk factor that might predict the manifestations associated with poor outcome and prognosis. Two RCTs have evidenced the efficacy of tocilizumab in addition to glucocorticoids (GCs) in the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA).

Although, Nkx2.1-Bmal1-/- mice were rhythmic and nocturnal, they showed altered patterns of locomotor activity during the night in a 12:12-h light:dark cycle and during subjective night in constant darkness. Control mice were more active during the first half than the second half of the dark phase or subjective night, whereas Nkx2.1-Bmal1-/- mice showed the opposite pattern of locomotor activity. Temporal patterns of sleep-wakefulness and feeding also changed accordingly. Such results suggest that along with mechanisms in the SCN, local Bmal1-dependent clocks in the ventral forebrain are critical for generating precise temporal patterns of circadian behaviors."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the site of the main circadian clock", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What part of what body organ controls the circadian clock?", "id": "5a95765bfcd1d6a10c000028_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the site of the main circadian clock, synchronized by the light-dark cycle, which generates behavioral rhythms like feeding, drinking and activity.

Moreover, whether circadian rhythms of particular motivated behaviors exist is unknown. Here, we evaluated the spontaneous daily and circadian behavior of consumption of a sweet caloric solution (5-10% sucrose), and the effects of sucrose intake on the expression of clock genes in the mouse brain. Mice showed a daily (in a light-dark cycle) and a circadian (in constant darkness conditions) rhythm in the intake and sucrose preference with a rise for both parameters at night (or subjective night). In addition, we observed changes in the circadian day-night expression of the clock gene Per2 in the SCN, cortex and striatum of animals ingesting sucrose compared to control mice on pure water.

To investigate the hypothesis that the circadian oscillator of the cerebellum is involved in circadian physiology and food anticipation, we therefore by use of Cre-LoxP technology generated a conditional knockout mouse with the core clock gene Arntl deleted specifically in granule cells of the cerebellum, since expression of clock genes in the cerebellar cortex is mainly located in this cell type. We here report that deletion of Arntl heavily influences the molecular clock of the cerebellar cortex with significantly altered and arrhythmic expression of other central clock and clock-controlled genes. On the other hand, daily expression of clock genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus was unaffected. Telemetric registrations in different light regimes did not detect significant differences in circadian rhythms of running activity and body temperature between Arntl conditional knockout mice and controls.

The molecular clock is present in virtually all cells of an organism. The central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) has been well studied, but the clocks in the peripheral tissues, such as heart and skeletal muscle, have just begun to be investigated. Skeletal muscle is one of the largest organs in the body, comprising approximately 45% of total body mass. More than 2300 genes in skeletal muscle are expressed in a circadian pattern, and these genes participate in a wide range of functions, including myogenesis, transcription, and metabolism. The circadian rhythms of skeletal muscle can be entrained both indirectly through light input to the SCN and directly through time of feeding and activity. It is critical for the skeletal muscle molecular clock not only to be entrained to the environment but also to be in synchrony with rhythms of other tissues. When circadian rhythms are disrupted, the observed effects on skeletal muscle include fiber-type shifts, altered sarcomeric structure, reduced mitochondrial respiration, and impaired muscle function. Furthermore, there are detrimental effects on metabolic health, including impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, which skeletal muscle likely contributes to considering it is a key metabolic tissue. These data indicate a critical role for skeletal muscle circadian rhythms for both muscle and systems health.

Robust circadian expression of Rev-erbα mRNA was completely damped in these tissues. Circadian expression of Dbp, a clock-controlled gene, was also disrupted in these tissues from mice housed under LD 3:3.

Both observational and interventional studies were included.MAIN MESSAGE: Both methadone and buprenorphine-naloxone are substantially more effective than abstinence-based treatment. Methadone has higher treatment retention rates than buprenorphine-naloxone does, while buprenorphine-naloxone has a lower risk of overdose. For all patient groups, physicians should recommend methadone or buprenorphine-naloxone treatment over abstinence-based treatment (level I evidence). Methadone is preferred over buprenorphine-naloxone for patients at higher risk of treatment dropout, such as injection opioid users (level I evidence). Youth and pregnant women who inject opioids should also receive methadone first (level III evidence). If buprenorphine-naloxone is prescribed first, the patient should be promptly switched to methadone if withdrawal symptoms, cravings, or opioid use persist despite an optimal buprenorphine-naloxone dose (level II evidence). Buprenorphine-naloxone is recommended for socially stable prescription oral opioid users, particularly if their work or family commitments make it difficult for them to attend the pharmacy daily, if they have a medical or psychiatric condition requiring regular primary care (level IV evidence), or if their jobs require higher levels of cognitive functioning or psychomotor performance (level III evidence). Buprenorphine-naloxone is also recommended for patients at high risk of methadone toxicity, such as the elderly, those taking high doses of benzodiazepines or other sedating drugs, heavy drinkers, those with a lower level of opioid tolerance, and those at high risk of prolonged QT interval (level III evidence).CONCLUSION: Individual patient characteristics and preferences should be taken into consideration when choosing a first-line opioid agonist treatment. For patients at high risk of dropout (such as adolescents and socially unstable patients), treatment retention should take precedence over other clinical considerations. For patients with high risk of toxicity (such as patients with heavy alcohol or benzodiazepine use), safety would likely be the first consideration.

In December 2006, the Food and Drug Administration issued a Public Health Advisory that alerted health care professionals to reports of death and life-threatening adverse events, such as respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias, in patients receiving methadone (4); in January 2008, a voluntary manufacturer restriction limited distribution of the 40 mg formulation of methadone.* CDC analyzed state mortality and health care data and preferred drug list (PDL) policies to 1) compare the percentage of deaths involving methadone with the rate of prescribing methadone for pain, 2) characterize variation in methadone prescribing among payers and states, and 3) assess whether an association existed between state Medicaid reimbursement PDL policies and methadone overdose rates. The analyses found that, from 2007 to 2014, large declines in methadone-related overdose deaths occurred. Prescriptions for methadone accounted for 0.85% of all opioid prescriptions for pain in the commercially insured population and 1.1% in the Medicaid population.

Although that period ended when oral methadone maintenance was established as legitimate medical practice, public concern about methadone diversion and accidental overdose fatalities, combined with political pressure from both hostile bureaucracies and groups committed to drug-free treatments, led to the development of unprecedented and detailed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations that specified the manner in which methadone (and later, levo-alpha-acetyl methadol, or levomethadyl acetate, (LAAM)) could be provided. In 1974, Congress gave the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) additional oversight of methadone treatment programs. Efforts to liberalize the FDA regulations over the past 30 years have been resisted by both the DEA and existing treatment providers. Additional flexibility for clinicians may evolve from the most recent effort to create an accreditation system to replace some of the FDA regulations. The development of buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, as an effective treatment for opioid addiction reopened the possibility for having a less burdensome oversight process, especially because of its reduced toxicity if ingested by non-tolerant individuals. New legislation, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) of 2000, created an opportunity for clinicians with special training to be exempted from both federal methadone regulations and the requirement to obtain a special DEA license when using buprenorphine to treat addicts.

Buprenorphine has partial mu-opioid receptor agonist activity and is a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist; hence, it can substitute for other micro-opioid receptor agonists, yet is less apt to produce overdose reactions or dysphoria. On the other hand, buprenorphine can block the effects of opioids such as heroin (diamorphine) and morphine, and can even precipitate withdrawal in individuals physically dependent upon these drugs. Buprenorphine has significant sublingual bioavailability and a long half-life, making administration on a less than daily basis possible. Furthermore, its discontinuation is associated with only a mild withdrawal syndrome. Clinical trials have demonstrated that sublingual buprenorphine is effective in both maintenance therapy and detoxification of individuals addicted to opioids. The introduction of a sublingual formulation combining naloxone with buprenorphine further reduces the risk of diversion to illicit intravenous use.

Although bone formation attenuates, bone mineral density (BMD) continues to increase. To explore potential tissue-level mechanisms that could contribute to a progressive increase in spine BMD, we used kinetic reconstruction techniques to examine the effects of romosozumab on modeling and remodeling units in vertebral cancellous bone from adult cynomolgus monkeys administered romosozumab for 10 and 28weeks. The 10-week study duration captured a period of high modeling-based bone formation, and the 28-week study duration followed the self-regulation or attenuation of bone formation in cancellous bone that occurs with long-term treatment. Sequential fluorochrome labels applied for the kinetic reconstruction were also used to evaluate treatment effects on osteoblast function as early as 3weeks, and on bone formation and bone accrual in the vertebral cortex over 28weeks. Kinetic reconstruction of remodeling and modeling formation sites in vertebral cancellous bone revealed that romosozumab effected significant transient increases in mineral apposition rate in remodeling sites at week 3 that was not sustained with continued treatment. However, romosozumab treatment caused sustained improvement in fractional labeling of osteoid, an index of osteoblast efficiency, at remodeling formative sites at both weeks 10 and 28 that was the major contributor to significant increases in final wall thickness (W.Th) of remodeling packets. Remodeling W.Th matched the final W.Th of modeling packets at week 10. At both weeks 10 and 28, romosozumab significantly decreased eroded surface (ES/BS). At week 28, romosozumab also significantly reduced resorption period (Rs.P) and final resorption depth (Rs.De). The reduced final Rs.De combined with the increased W.Th resulted in a significant increase in bone balance (BB) at the level of the remodeling unit. Assessment of bone formation on the vertebral periosteal and endocortical surfaces following 28weeks of treatment revealed that romosozumab significantly increased bone formation on these surfaces, which had attenuated by week 28, resulting in significant increases in new periosteal and endocortical bone by week 28. These data suggest that multiple factors potentially contribute to the increase in spine BMD with romosozumab treatment. In the early period of treatment, increased modeling-based bone formation, increased W.Th at remodeling sites, a decrease in remodeling space secondary to decreased ES/BS in vertebral cancellous bone, and increased periosteal and endocortical bone formation in the vertebral cortex contribute to the early increase in spine BMD. Following the self-regulation of bone formation when modeling-based bone formation has attenuated, a decrease in remodeling space secondary to reduced ES/BS and a positive BB secondary to decreased final Rs.De and increased W.Th contribute to the progressive increase in spine BMD with long-term treatment."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Romosozumab, an anti-sclerosin antibody, and abaloparatide, a PTH-related peptide analog, are at present in advanced stages of clinical evaluation, so far demonstrating efficaciousness together with a favorable safety profile.", "answer_start": 1142}], "question": "Describe mechanism of action of Romosozumab.", "id": "5a723a652dc08e987e00000a_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Since the identification of osteoporosis as a major health issue in aging populations and the subsequent development of the first treatment modalities for its management, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling bone turnover and disease pathophysiology, thus enabling the pinpointing of new targets for intervention.

Currently available strong anti-resorptive agents are bisphosphonates and an anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) antibody, denosumab. Although bisphosphonates and denosumab both inhibit bone resorption and prevent vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, their mechanisms of action are different. Whereas bisphosphonates' effects on bone mineral density and fracture peak around 3 to 5 years and become plateaued, those of denosumab are maintained for up to 10 years. There are differences in the modes of action of these two drugs. Bisphosphonates accumulate on the mineralized bone surface and are released by the acid environment under osteoclastic bone resorption, whereas denosumab is not accumulated on bone but directly binds RANKL and inhibits its binding to the receptor RANK. Thus, the reduction in denosumab concentration 4 to 6 months after injection may enable RANK to bind to RANKL, where it is highly expressed, such as in damaged bone regions.

We asked if there is a specificity in the activation of the stress-responsive transcription factors Nrf2, ATF4, and AP-1/c-Jun, or if activation of these proteins is a redundant cellular answer toward extracellular stressors. Here, we show that oxidative stress, induced by stimulation of the cells with the oxidant arsenite, strongly activated gene transcription via the stress-responsive element (StRE), while phorbol ester or tunicamycin, activators of AP-1/c-Jun or ATF4, respectively, activated AP-1 or nutrient-sensing response element-mediated transcription. Preincubation of the cells with N-acetyl-cysteine or overexpression of thioredoxin selectively attenuated arsenite-induced upregulation of StRE-regulated transcription. Expression of either dominant-negative or constitutively active mutants of Nrf2, ATF4, or c-Jun confirmed that distinct transcription units are regulated by these transcription factors. Physiological stimuli involving the activation of either Gαq-coupled designer receptors or the protein kinases c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase or p38 strongly stimulated transcription via AP-1/c-Jun, with minimal effects on Nrf2 or ATF4-responsive promoters. Thus, activation of transcription by extracellular signaling molecules shows specificity at the level of the chemical nature of the signaling molecule, at the level of the intracellular transduction process, and at the level of signal-responsive transcription factors.

We found that a 24-h treatment with usnic acid caused DNA damage and S-phase cell cycle arrest in a concentration-dependent manner. Usnic acid also triggered oxidative stress as demonstrated by increased reactive oxygen species generation and glutathione depletion. Short-term treatment (6 h) with usnic acid significantly increased the protein level for Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2), promoted Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus, up-regulated antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase reporter activity, and induced the expression of Nrf2-regulated targets, including glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1).

We hypothesized that, compared to E3 mice, E4 mice would be more susceptible to the harmful cognitive effects of high fat diet (HFD)-induced IR due to apoE isoform-specific differences in brain metabolism. While both E3 and E4 mice fed HFD displayed impairments in peripheral metabolism and cognition, deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory were exaggerated in E4 mice. Combining genome-wide measures of DNA hydroxymethylation with comprehensive untargeted metabolomics, we identified novel alterations in purine metabolism, glutamate metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway.

In addition, clusterin promotes Aβ degradation and accelerates Aβ clearance from the brain. Clusterin thus protects neurons from Aβ and loss of clusterin level in the brain is implicated as promoting AD pathology. In this study, we found that the level of clusterin protein but not mRNA is reduced in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. When rat hippocampal primary neurons were treated with Aβ1-42, level of clusterin protein but not mRNA was downregulated. Aβ1-42-induced downregulation of clusterin was blocked by lysosome inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride. In neurons, Aβ1-42 induced expression of sortilin, a lysosomal sorting protein that targets proteins to lysosome for degradation. In BE(2) M17 human neuroblastoma cells, clusterin bound to sortilin and when sortilin expression was silenced, Aβ1-42-induced clusterin downregulation was almost completely blocked.

Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of hypertension and RAS on glial (astrocytes and microglia) activation and hippocampal neurogenesis in a rat model of chronic hypertension. We used Candesartan [angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker (ARB)] both at a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) and anti-hypertensive dose (2 mg/kg) to explore whether their effect on astrocyte and microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis is blood pressure (BP) dependent or independent. Our data revealed that hypertension induces robust microglial and astrocyte activation, neuroinflammation, and cripples hippocampal neurogenesis. Importantly, AT1R blockade by Candesartan, even at low dose (0.1 mg/kg), prevented astrocyte and microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the brain of hypertensive rats. Mechanistically, AT1R blockade prevented the activation of NADPH oxidase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, suppression of MAP kinase and NFкB signaling. Importantly, we, for the first time to our knowledge, provided the evidence that AT1R blockade by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling, promotes neurogenesis during hypertensive state. We conclude that AT1R blockade prevents astrocyte and microglial activation and improves hippocampal neurogenesis in hypertensive state, independent of BP lowering action."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Major risk factors for AD are advancing age and diabetes.

Lately, obesity has been associated with an increased risk of dementia. Obese and diabetic individuals are prone to decreased circulating levels of zinc, reducing the amount of zinc available for crucial intracellular processes. In the brain, zinc co-localizes with glutamate in synaptic vesicles, and modulates NMDA receptor activity. Intracellular zinc is involved in apoptosis and fluctuations in cytoplasmic Zn(2+) affect modulation of intracellular signaling. The ZNT and ZIP proteins participate in intracellular zinc homeostasis. Altered expression of zinc-regulatory proteins has been described in AD patients. Using microarray data from human frontal cortex (BrainCloud), this study investigates expression of the SCLA30A (ZNT) and SCLA39A (ZIP) families of genes in a Caucasian and African-American sample of 145 neurologically and psychiatrically normal individuals. Expression of ZNT3 and ZNT4 were significantly reduced with increasing age, whereas expression of ZIP1, ZIP9 and ZIP13 were significantly increased. Increasing body mass index (BMI) correlated with a significant reduction in ZNT1 expression similar to what is seen in the early stages of AD. Increasing BMI also correlated with reduced expression of ZNT6. In conclusion, we found that the expression of genes that regulate intracellular zinc homeostasis in the human frontal cortex is altered with increasing age and affected by increasing BMI.

The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Each CT order for pulmonary angiography was exposed to CDS on the basis of the Wells criteria. For patients with a Wells score of 4 or less, CDS alerts suggested d-dimer testing because acute PE is highly unlikely in these patients if d-dimer levels are normal. The yield of CT pulmonary angiography (number of positive PE diagnoses/total number of CT pulmonary angiographic examinations) was compared in patients in whom providers overrode CDS alerts (by performing CT pulmonary angiography in patients with a Wells score ≤4 and a normal d-dimer level or no d-dimer testing) (override group) and those in whom providers followed Wells criteria (CT pulmonary angiography only in patients with Wells score >4 or ≤4 with elevated d-dimer level) (adherent group). A validated natural language processing tool identified positive PE diagnoses, with subsegmental and/or indeterminate diagnoses removed by means of chart review. Statistical analysis was performed with the χ2 test, the Student t test, and logistic regression. Results Among 2993 CT pulmonary angiography studies in 2655 patients, 563 examinations had a Wells score of 4 or less but did not undergo d-dimer testing and 26 had a Wells score of 4 or less and had normal d-dimer levels. The yield of CT pulmonary angiography was 4.2% in the override group (25 of 589 studies, none with a normal d-dimer level) and 11.2% in the adherent group (270 of 2404 studies) (P < .001). After adjustment for the risk factor differences between the two groups, the odds of an acute PE finding were 51.3% lower when providers overrode alerts than when they followed CDS guidelines. Comparison of the two groups including only patients unlikely to have PE led to similar results. Conclusion The odds of an acute PE finding in the ED when providers adhered to evidence presented in CDS were nearly double those seen when providers overrode CDS alerts. Most overrides were due to the lack of d-dimer testing in patients unlikely to have PE. © RSNA, 2016."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography angiography (CTA) and ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan in the assessment of pulmonary embolism (PE) by means of a Bayesian statistical model.METHODS: Wells criteria defined pretest probability.

Of the 138 women enrolled, 59 had no endometriosis, 21 had stage I, 10 had stage II, 23 had stage III and 25 had stage IV. SNPs were discriminated by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization.RESULTS: Individuals having at least one A-allele (A/G or A/A genotype) of HSD17B1 showed a significantly increased risk of endometriosis (A/G genotype: adjusted OR, 3.06; 95%CI 1.21-7.74; A/A genotype: adjusted OR, 3.02; 95%CI 1.08-8.43).

Painful skin ulcerations and calcification of cutaneous arterioles characterize calciphylaxis.Methods: We established an observational, Internet-based registry allowing online notification for all German CUA cases. The registry recorded data about patient characteristics, biochemistry and therapies. Blood samples were stored in a central biobank.Results: Between 2006 and 2015, 253 CUA patients were recorded: median age 70 [interquartile range (IQR) 61-76] years, 60% females and 86% ( n = 207) dialysis patients, translating into an estimated annual incidence rate of 0.04% in German dialysis patients. Fifty-two per cent received vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) prior to CUA. Skin lesions were localized in 71% on the legs or gluteal region. In dialysis CUA patients median total serum calcium was 2.20 (IQR 2.06-2.37) mmol/L, phosphorus 1.67 (IQR 1.35-2.03) mmol/L, intact parathyroid hormone 147 (IQR 72-276) pg/mL and fetuin-A 0.21 (IQR 0.16-0.26) g/L (normal range 0.35-0.95). Median sclerostin, osteoprotegerin, TRAP5b, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and c-terminal FGF23 levels were all elevated. The most frequently recorded therapeutic procedures in dialysis CUA patients were as follows: wound debridement (29% of cases), stopping VKA (25%), lowering calcium supply (24%), sodium thiosulphate (22%), application of vitamin K (18%), increase of dialysis duration/frequency (17%) and stoping active vitamin D (16%).Conclusions: Approximately 50% of CUA patients used VKA. Our data suggest that uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism is not the key determinant of calciphylaxis. Therapeutic strategies were heterogeneous.

Cases included met the operational definition of nonuremic calciphylaxis-histopathologic diagnosis of calciphylaxis in the absence of end-stage kidney disease, renal transplantation, or acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy.RESULTS: We found 36 cases (75% women, 63% Caucasian, aged 15 to 82 yr) of nonuremic calciphylaxis. Primary hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, alcoholic liver disease, and connective tissue disease were the most common reported causes. Preceding corticosteroid use was reported for 61% patients. Protein C and S deficiencies were seen in 11% of patients. Skin lesions were morphologically similar to calcific uremic arteriolopathy.

Patients with calciphylaxis were significantly younger (49 versus 60 years; p = 0.01), had undergone hemodialysis longer (80 versus 20 months; p < 0.0001), and had higher median serum calcium (9.7 versus 9.2 mg/dl; p = 0.03), phosphate (8.2 versus 5.7 mg/dl; p = 0.001), calcium phosphate product (81.5 versus 52.9; p = 0.0004), parathyroid hormone (1496 versus 138 pg/ml; p < 0.0001), and alkaline phosphatase levels (188 versus 89 IU/L; p = 0.0001).

TCPO(2) levels were measured in 21 patients with calciphylaxis and 21 age- and sex-matched patients without evidence of calciphylaxis (controls). TCPO(2) levels were measured bilaterally at the chest, anterior abdomen, and upper thigh while patients breathed room air and after a 30-minute exposure to 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)). Compared with controls, patients with calciphylaxis showed significantly lower TCPO(2) levels at each body region. In both controls and patients with calciphylaxis, lower TCPO(2) levels correlated with increased weight and use of hemodialysis. No correlation with serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium, or serum phosphorus values was present, although 39% of the patients with calciphylaxis had markedly elevated PTH values (sixfold greater than normal; >300 pg/dL). Low TCPO(2) levels in patients with calciphylaxis were documented in body regions with and without skin lesions. In patients with calciphylaxis, extremely low TCPO(2) values (</=30 mm Hg while patients breathed room air) were present in 62% of the body regions with skin lesions and 26% of the body regions without lesions.

In conclusion, TCPO(2) levels are abnormally low in patients with calciphylaxis, indicating that severe and diffuse skin ischemia exists, even at areas free of skin lesions. Low TCPO(2) values did not substantially increase with 100% FIO(2) in many patients with calciphylaxis, suggesting a fixed insufficiency of the skin vessels.

We have recently demonstrated that HDAC2 reciprocally regulates the transcription of Arginase2, which is itself a critical modulator of endothelial function via eNOS. Moreover HDAC2 levels are decreased in response to the atherogenic stimulus OxLDL via a mechanism that is apparently dependent upon proteasomal degradation. NEDDylation is a post-translational protein modification that is tightly linked to ubiquitination and thereby protein degradation. We propose that changes in NEDDylation may modulate vascular endothelial function in part through alterations in the proteasomal degradation of HDAC2. In HAEC, OxLDL exposure augmented global protein NEDDylation. Pre-incubation of mouse aortic rings with the NEDDylation activating enzyme inhibitor, MLN4924, prevented OxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction. In HAEC, MLN enhanced HDAC2 abundance, decreased expression and activity of Arginase2, and blocked OxLDL-mediated reduction of HDAC2. Additionally, HDAC2 was shown to be a substrate for NEDD8 conjugation and this interaction was potentiated by OxLDL. Further, HDAC2 levels were reciprocally regulated by ectopic expression of NEDD8 and the de-NEDDylating enzyme SENP8. Our findings indicate that the observed improvement in endothelial dysfunction with inhibition of NEDDylation activating enzyme is likely due to an HDAC2-dependent decrease in Arginase2.

However, it is unknown whether and how UBE2F, a less characterized neddylation E2, regulates lung cancer cell survival, and whether and how NOXA, a proapoptotic protein, is ubiquitylated and degraded by which E3 and via which ubiquitin linkage.Experimental Design: Methods of immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were utilized to examine UBE2F protein expression. The biological functions of UBE2F were evaluated by in vitro cell culture and in vivo xenograft models. The in vivo complex formation among UBE2F-SAG-CUL5-NOXA was measured by a pulldown assay. Polyubiquitylation of NOXA was evaluated by in vivo and in vitro ubiquitylation assays.Results: UBE2F is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and predicts poor patient survival. While UBE2F overexpression promotes lung cancer growth both in vitro and in vivo, UBE2F knockdown selectively inhibits tumor growth. By promoting CUL5 neddylation, UBE2F/SAG/CUL5 tri-complex activates CRL5 (Cullin-RING-ligase-5) to ubiquitylate NOXA via a novel K11, but not K48, linkage for targeted proteasomal degradation. CRL5 inactivation or forced expression of K11R ubiquitin mutant caused NOXA accumulation to induce apoptosis, which is rescued by NOXA knockdown. Notably, NOXA knockdown rescues the UBE2F silencing effect, indicating a causal role of NOXA in this process. In lung cancer tissues, high levels of UBE2F and CUL5 correlate with a low level of NOXA and poor patient survival.Conclusions: By ubiquitylating and degrading NOXA through activating CRL5, UBE2F selectively promotes lung cancer cell survival and could, therefore, serve as a novel cancer target.

We also evaluated the effects of imatinib on luminal obstruction and fibrocyte accumulation. The effects of imatinib on fibrocyte migration and differentiation were assessed by culturing fibrocytes in vitro.RESULTS: In the murine BO model, tracheal allografts showed epithelial injury and developed complete luminal occlusion 28 days after transplantation. Most of the mesenchymal cells that had accumulated in the tracheal allograft were derived from BM cells. Imatinib treatment ameliorated the airway luminal occlusion and significantly reduced the number of fibrocytes in the allografts. In vitro studies showed that imatinib inhibited migration of cultured blood fibrocytes via the platelet-derived growth factor/platelet-derived growth factor receptor axis.

Fibrocytes are bone marrow-derived progenitor cells that produce growth factors and contribute to fibrogenesis in the lungs. However, the effects of nintedanib on the functions of fibrocytes remain unclear.METHODS: Human monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. The expression of growth factors and their receptors in fibrocytes was analyzed using ELISA and Western blotting. The effects of nintedanib on the ability of fibrocytes to stimulate lung fibroblasts were examined in terms of their proliferation. The direct effects of nintedanib on the differentiation and migration of fibrocytes were also assessed. We investigated whether nintedanib affected the accumulation of fibrocytes in mouse lungs treated with bleomycin.RESULTS: Human fibrocytes produced PDGF, FGF2, and VEGF-A. Nintedanib and specific inhibitors for each growth factor receptor significantly inhibited the proliferation of lung fibroblasts stimulated by the supernatant of fibrocytes. Nintedanib inhibited the migration and differentiation of fibrocytes induced by growth factors in vitro. The number of fibrocytes in the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model was reduced by the administration of nintedanib, and this was associated with anti-fibrotic effects.CONCLUSIONS: These results support the role of fibrocytes as producers of and responders to growth factors, and suggest that the anti-fibrotic effects of nintedanib are at least partly mediated by suppression of fibrocyte function."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In addition, overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose.

Despite comparable protein content, nominal doses differed: 17.5 mg/m(2)/day (ch14.18-UTC) and 25 mg/m(2)/day (ch14.18-NCI). Patients received one product during therapy cycles 1 and 2, the other during cycles 3-5. Ch14.18 pharmacokinetic profile characterization used population modeling (NONMEM(®) version 7.2). A two-compartment model with first-order distribution and elimination processes described pharmacokinetic data. Estimated product parameters were normalized to UTC nominal dose. For pharmacokinetic comparability, the final model was used to estimate exposure ratios (UTC/NCI) and associated 90 % confidence intervals (CIs) for area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf) and maximum concentration (C max). All comparisons were based on a standardized single-dose regimen (17.5 mg/m(2) over 10 h).RESULTS: Final-model pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to previously published ch14.18-NCI parameters and comparable for UTC and NCI products.

Galunisertib, an inhibitor of TGFβR1, was examined for its ability to enhance the efficacy of dinutuximab in combination with human ex vivo activated NK (aNK) cells against neuroblastoma.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGFB1 and TGFBR1 mRNA expression was determined for 249 primary neuroblastoma tumors by microarray analysis. The ability of galunisertib to inhibit SMAD activity induced by neuroblastoma patient blood and bone marrow plasmas in neuroblastoma cells was tested. The impact of galunisertib on TGFβ1-induced inhibition of aNK cytotoxicity and ADCC in vitro and on anti-neuroblastoma activity in NOD-scid gamma (NSG) mice was determined.RESULTS: Neuroblastomas express TGFB1 and TGFBR1 mRNA. Galunisertib suppressed SMAD activation in neuroblastoma cells induced by exogenous TGFβ1 or by patient blood and bone marrow plasma, and suppressed SMAD2 phosphorylation in human neuroblastoma cells growing in NSG mice. In NK cells treated in vitro with exogenous TGFβ1, galunisertib suppressed SMAD2 phosphorylation and restored the expression of DNAM-1, NKp30, and NKG2D cytotoxicity receptors and the TRAIL death ligand, the release of perforin and granzyme A, and the direct cytotoxicity and ADCC of aNK cells against neuroblastoma cells. Addition of galunisertib to adoptive cell therapy with aNK cells plus dinutuximab reduced tumor growth and increased survival of mice injected with two neuroblastoma cell lines or a patient-derived xenograft.CONCLUSIONS: Galunisertib suppresses activation of SMAD2 in neuroblastomas and aNK cells, restores NK cytotoxic mechanisms, and increases the efficacy of dinutuximab with aNK cells against neuroblastoma tumors.

Recent evidence indicates that circRNAs play important roles in tissue development, gene regulation, and carcinogenesis.

Northern blotting, Sanger sequencing, antibody, and liquid chromatograph Tandem Mass Spectrometer were used to confirm the existence of circ-FBXW7 and its encoded protein in in two cell lines. Lentivirus-transfected stable U251 and U373 cells were used to assess the biological functions of the novel protein invitro and invivo (five mice per group). Clinical implications of circ-FBXW7 were assessed in 38 pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma samples and their paired periphery normal brain tissues by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (two-sided log-rank test).Results: Circ-FBXW7 is abundantly expressed in the normal human brain (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads [RPKM] = 9.31). The spanning junction open reading frame in circ-FBXW7 driven by internal ribosome entry site encodes a novel 21-kDa protein, which we termed FBXW7-185aa. Upregulation of FBXW7-185aa in cancer cells inhibited proliferation and cell cycle acceleration, while knockdown of FBXW7-185aa promoted malignant phenotypes invitro and invivo. FBXW7-185aa reduced the half-life of c-Myc by antagonizing USP28-induced c-Myc stabilization. Moreover, circ-FBXW7 and FBXW7-185aa levels were reduced in glioblastoma clinical samples compared with their paired tumor-adjacent tissues (P < .001).

However active, prompt and accurate diagnosis is the key element in the public health response to tuberculosis and the cornerstone of tuberculosis control. Different diagnostic methods for an assured diagnosis of TB are necessary. Chest radiography is a useful keystone to identify tuberculosis, but diagnosis of tuberculosis cannot be established by radiography alone. CT scanning is used in patients without pathological chest radiography but clinically suspected active TB and to differentiate TB from other diseases. Radiological appearance is primarily determined by the immune status of patients and caverns and disseminated disease foci are often observed. Laboratory diagnostic methods include microscopic identification of acid-fast mycobacteria from any body fluid (especially sputum), as well as isolation and characterisation of mycobacteria in culture. It is then possible to type the pathogens by the shape of their colony, their growth behavior and their biochemical characteristics. These methods are regarded as the gold standard in diagnosis of active TB. In patients who are highly suspected of having TB, but whose sputum specimens tested negative for mycobacteria, a nucleic acid amplification test is additionally performed. Moreover, sensitivity testing with first and second line antitubercular drugs is applied as standard. Laboratory diagnostic testing of cellular immunity against pathogenic mycobacteria employs the tuberculin skin test (TST, Mantoux tuberculin test) or the more specific interferon γ test to determine γ interferon released by T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro. The new ELISA and ELISPOT procedures exhibit higher test specificity and less cross reactivity to NTM (non-tuberculosis mycobacteria), are independent of BCG-vaccination status and correlate better with the degree of exposure than does the TST."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Latent tuberculosis treatment was recommended in all Mantoux-positive contacts.", "answer_start": 1545}], "question": "The Mantoux test detects what latent infection/disease?", "id": "5ab147edfcf4565872000013_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the importance of preventive measures when a case of tuberculosis is detected, identify the causes that favored a tuberculosis outbreak in a school and determine the efficiency of obtaining induced sputum samples.DESIGN: Descriptive, study.SETTING: The Santa Maria de la Providencia school, located in the municipality of Alcala de Henares in Spain.INTERVENTIONS: On April 11, 2005, a case of bacilliform pulmonary tuberculosis was notified in a teacher.

The plasma MMP12 concentration showed association with incident cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (130 and 67 events, respectively, over 36 months) and carotid intima-media thickness progression (P = 3.6 × 10-5 ). A GWAS of plasma MMP12 concentrations revealed that SNPs rs499459, rs613084 and rs1892971 at chr11q22.3 were independently associated with plasma MMP12 (P < 5 × 10-8 ). The lead SNPs showed associations with mRNA levels of MMP12 and adjacent MMPs in atherosclerotic plaques. MMP12 transcriptomic and proteomic levels were strongly significantly increased in carotid plaques compared with control arterial tissue and in plaques from symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. By combining immunohistochemistry and proximity ligation assay, we demonstrated that MMP12 localizes to CD68 + macrophages and interacts with elastin in plaques. MMP12 silencing in human THP-1-derived macrophages resulted in reduced macrophage migration.CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the notion that MMP12 is implicated in large-artery atherosclerotic stroke, functionally by enhancing elastin degradation and macrophage invasion in plaques.© 2017 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The samples were analyzed with a multiplex proximity extension assay in which 92 inflammation-related proteins were measured simultaneously (Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I; Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden).", "answer_start": 738}], "question": "What is measured with the Proseek panels?", "id": "5a9d99ac4e03427e73000002_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Animal models suggest that chemokines are important mediators in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.

Whether soluble biomarkers reflect the local gene environment and ischemic time is unclear. We explored whether circulating biomarkers were associated with corresponding coronary thrombi genes and total ischemic time.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 33 AMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), blood samples were collected within 6-24h for markers related to plaque rupture (metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1), platelet and endothelial cell activation (P-selectin, CD40 ligand, PAR-1), hemostasis (tissue factor, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, free and total tissue factor pathway inhibitor, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2), inflammation (interleukin 8 and 18, fractalkine, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), CXCL1, pentraxin 3, myeloperoxidase) and galectin 3, caspase 8 and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Laboratory analyses were performed by Proximity Extension Assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD I(96 × 96)), ELISAs and RT-PCR.RESULTS: Only circulating P-selectin correlated to the corresponding P-selectin gene expression in thrombi (r=0.530, p=0.002). Plasma galectin 3, fractalkine, MCP-1 and caspase 8 correlated inversely to ischemic time (r=-0.38-0.50, all p <0.05), while plasma MCP-1, galectin 3 and EGF were higher at short (≤ 4 h) vs. long (>4h) ischemic time (all p <0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic changes in circulating mediators along ischemic time were not reflected in the profile of locally expressed genes. These observations indicate a locally confined milieu within the site of atherothrombosis, which may be important for selective therapy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Ischemia followed by reperfusion rapidly leads to the expression of inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, which stimulate a complex cascade of events involving local endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and perivascular cells. A secondary response includes the release of other cytokines, an increase in components of the coagulation system, an upregulation of cell adhesion molecule expression, and changes in the expression of components of the immune response. The net effect of these events is transformation of the local endothelium to a prothrombotic/proinflammatory state and induction of leukocyte migration to the site of injury. A number of studies have shown that leukocyte migration occurs within hours of reperfusion. Leukocytes accumulate in the injured region, where they cause tissue injury by several mechanisms, including occlusion of microvasculature, generation of oxygen free radicals, release of cytotoxic enzymes, alteration of vasomotor reactivity, and increase in cytokine and chemoattractant release. Monoclonal antibodies against leukocyte adhesion molecules have been shown to reduce infarct volume in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion. However, this treatment failed to show benefit in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial. A number of factors may complicate the use of antibody directed adhesion molecule blockade in acute stroke and will be discussed in this article. Overall, an increased understanding of inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms still offers great potential for reducing acute stroke injury."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enlimomab, a murine monoclonal anti-human intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 antibody, had a negative outcome in a multicenter acute-stroke trial.

Permanent MCAO results in a modest neutrophil infiltration at 24 h after ischaemia, predominantly around arterial vessels at the margins of infarction, whereas MCAO with subsequent reperfusion is associated with substantial infiltration by neutrophils throughout the entire infarct. Several studies show that C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, is associated with stroke outcomes and future vascular events. Several drugs, especially hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), have been demonstrated to reduce hsCRP levels independently of their effects on plasma cholesterol. Various cytokines were shown to be expressed in the injured brain. Recent investigations demonstrated that mRNAs of above cytokines were induced in the ischemic rat brain. TNF-alpha is a pleiotropic cytokine that mediates key roles in many physiological and pathological cellular processes including acute and chronic inflammation, programmed cell death or apoptosis, anti-tumor responses, and infection. Pharmaceutical industry to search a small molecule TNF inhibitor have taken multiple strategies. Significant protection after in vivo oral use of SB-239063 from brain injury and neurological deficits was observed in one study. In the same study significant protection from brain injury and neurological deficits was also demonstrated due to i.v post-stroke treatment with the same compound. Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion process consists of several steps, beginning with rolling of the leukocyte on the endothelial surface until it has slowed down to such a degree that it sticks to the endothelium. Treatment with a murine anti-ICAM-1 antibody (enlimomab) has been investigated in patients with acute ischemic stroke in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial (EAST). Unfortunately, the case fatality rate in this trial was significantly higher in the enlimomab patient group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, experimental data have shown that focal cerebral ischemia induces a time-dependent activation of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Dissipation of ATP by CD39 reduced P2X7 receptor stimulation and thereby suppressed baseline leukocyte alphaMbeta2-integrin expression. As alphaMbeta2-integrin blockade reversed the postischemic, inflammatory phenotype of Cd39-/- mice, these data suggest that phosphohydrolytic activity on the leukocyte surface suppresses cell-cell interactions that would otherwise promote thrombosis or inflammation."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": []}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The meta-analysis showed that no significant differences were found in the long-term mortality (OR=0.91, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.09, P=0.30), the rate of dependency (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.24, P=0.85), and the effective rate (OR=0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14, P=0.82) between citicoline group and control group.

The objective of the research described here is to design a protocol that maximizes protein sequence coverage and enables detection of post-translational modifications, specifically N-linked glycosylation. To achieve this objective, a highly efficient proteolytic digest protocol using trypsin was designed by comparing the relative merits of denaturing agents (urea and Rapigest SF), reducing agents [dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phophine (TCEP)], and various concentrations of alkylating agent [iodoacetamide (IAM)]. After analysis of human apo-transferrin using various protease digestion protocols, ideal conditions were determined to contain 6 M urea for denaturation, 5 mM TCEP for reduction, 10 mM IAM for alkylation, and 10 mM DTT, to quench excess IAM before the addition of trypsin. This method was successfully applied to a novel recombinant protein, human lysyl oxidase-like 2. Furthermore, the glycosylation PTMs were readily detected at two glycosylation sites in the protein.

Sequencing pre-mRNA at different stages of splicing potentially provides insight into mRNA maturation. Although the number of tools that analyze total and cytoplasmic RNA in order to elucidate the transcriptome composition is rapidly growing, there are no tools specifically designed for the analysis of nuclear RNA (which contains mixtures of pre- and mature mRNA).

Conversely, the RS-exon is included when preceded by cryptic promoters or exons that fail to reconstitute an efficient 5' splice site. Most RS-exons contain a premature stop codon such that their inclusion can decrease mRNA stability.

Although the cell-intrinsic effects of EMT are important for tumor progression, the reciprocal dynamic crosstalk between mesenchymal cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is equally critical in regulating invasion and metastasis. Investigating the collaborative effect of EMT and ECM in the metastatic process reveals increased collagen deposition in metastatic tumor tissues as a direct consequence of amplified collagen gene expression in ZEB1-activated mesenchymal lung cancer cells. In addition, collagen fibers in metastatic lung tumors exhibit greater linearity and organization as a result of collagen crosslinking by the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of enzymes. Expression of the LOX and LOXL2 isoforms is directly regulated by miR-200 and ZEB1, respectively, and their upregulation in metastatic tumors and mesenchymal cell lines is coordinated to that of collagen. Functionally, LOXL2, as opposed to LOX, is the principal isoform that crosslinks and stabilizes insoluble collagen deposition in tumor tissues. In turn, focal adhesion formation and FAK/SRC signaling is activated in mesenchymal tumor cells by crosslinked collagen in the ECM.

In archaea, aPelota and aEF1α, homologous to Pelota and Hbs1, respectively, are considered to be involved in that process. In recent years, great progress has been made in determining structures of Dom34/aPelota and Hbs1/aEF1α.

Combined with the functional analysis in yeast, the present results provide structural insights into the molecular interaction between eukaryotic Pelota and Hbs1. Strikingly, the aPelota·aEF1α complex structurally resembles the tRNA·EF-Tu complex bound to the ribosome.

Our goal was to evaluate the contribution of TRPM2 to the tissue damage after stroke.METHODS: In accordance with current quality guidelines, we independently characterized Trpm2 in a murine ischemic stroke model in 2 different laboratories.RESULTS: Gene deficiency of Trpm2 resulted in significantly improved neurological outcome and decreased infarct size. Besides an already known moderate neuroprotective effect of Trpm2 deficiency in vitro, ischemic brain invasion by neutrophils and macrophages was particularly reduced in Trpm2-deficient mice. Bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that Trpm2 deficiency in the peripheral immune system is responsible for the protective phenotype. Furthermore, experiments with mixed bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that Trpm2 is essential for the migration of neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, also of macrophages into ischemic hemispheres. Notably, the pharmacological TRPM2 inhibitor, N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid, was equally protective in the stroke model.CONCLUSIONS: Although a neuroprotective effect of TRPM2 in vitro is well known, we can show for the first time that the detrimental role of TRPM2 in stroke primarily depends on its role in activating peripheral immune cells.

Herein, we explore the relation between cellular GSH and TRPM2 channel activity in long-term cultures of hippocampal neurons.RESULTS: In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we observe that TRPM2 current density increases in cultured pyramidal neurons over time in vitro. The observed increase in current density was prevented by treatment with NAC, a precursor to GSH synthesis. Conversely, treatment of cultures maintained for 2 weeks in vitro with L-BSO, which depletes GSH by inhibiting its synthesis, augments TRPM2 currents. Additionally, we demonstrate that GSH inhibits TRPM2 currents through a thiol-independent mechanism, and produces a 3.5-fold shift in the dose-response curve generated by ADPR, the intracellular agonist for TRPM2.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that GSH plays a physiologically relevant role in the regulation of TRPM2 currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.

In most cases, onychomycosis is associated with limited treatment options that are effective in achieving complete clearance in many cases. In addition, recurrence rates are high in the subset of treated patients who have been effectively cleared, usually with an oral antifungal agent. There has been a conspicuous absence of medical therapies approved in the United States since the introduction of topical ciclopirox (8% nail lacquer), with no new effective agents introduced for more than 10 years. Fortunately, newer agents and formulations have been under formal development. While patients might prefer a topical therapy, efficacy with ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer, the only available agent until the very recent approval of efinaconazole 10% solution, has been disappointing. The poor therapeutic outcomes achieved with ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer were not unexpected as the cure rates achieved in the clinical trials were unimpressive, despite concomitant nail debridement, which was an integral part of the pivotal trials with ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer. Efinaconazole 10% solution and tavaborole 5% solution are new topical antifungals specifically developed for the treatment of dermatophyte onychomycosis. In Phase 3 clinical trials, both newer agents were applied once daily for 48 weeks without concomitant nail debridement. Mycologic cure rates with efinaconazole 10% solution are markedly superior to what was achieved with ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer. To add, they appear to be nearly comparable to those achieved with oral itraconazole in pivotal clinical trials. However, it is important to remember that direct comparisons between different studies are not conclusive, are not generally considered to be scientifically sound, and may not be entirely accurate due to differences in study design and other factors. Well-designed and properly powered head-to-head studies are needed in order to draw definitive conclusions about efficacy comparisons between therapies, at least based on academic and regulatory standards. Although tavaborole 5% solution is in an earlier phase of development for onychomycosis, treatment success rates reported thus far for both efinaconazole 10% solution and tavaborole 5% solution are superior to ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer. As a result, a new era of onychomycosis appears to be upon us that incorporates topical therapy more effectively than in the past. Not only may these newer topical agents provide viable monotherapy alternatives to oral therapy for onychomycosis, topical therapy for onychomycosis that is effective, well tolerated, and easy to use may also find a role in combination therapy, and/or as continued therapy after initial clearance to reduce recurrence or re-infection."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "skin infections with dermatophytes such as tinea pedis and tinea corporis,", "answer_start": 655}], "question": "What disease is tinea ?", "id": "5aa67b4fd6d6b54f7900000f_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Olympic athletes are vulnerable to traumatic, environmental and infectious skin manifestations.

Using both techniques, we screened for regulatory regions that become ectopically active during Ras-dependent oncogenesis, and identified 3778 regions that become (over-)activated during tumor development. Next, we applied motif discovery to search for candidate transcription factors that could bind these regions and identified AP-1 and Stat92E as key regulators. We validated the importance of Stat92E in the development of the tumors by introducing a loss of function Stat92E mutant, which was sufficient to rescue the tumor phenotype. Additionally we tested if the predicted Stat92E responsive regulatory regions are genuine, using ectopic induction of JAK/STAT signaling in developing eye discs, and observed that similar chromatin changes indeed occurred. Finally, we determine that these are functionally significant regulatory changes, as nearby target genes are up- or down-regulated.

However, vulvar Paget disease is in itself a heterogeneous group of epithelial neoplasms that can be similar both clinically and histopathologically. The subtypes of vulvar Paget disease include primary Paget disease arising from a pluripotent stem cell within the epithelium of the vulva, and secondary Paget disease of the vulva. Secondary vulvar Paget disease results from spread of an internal malignancy, most commonly from an anorectal adenocarcinoma or urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or urethra, to the vulvar epithelium. We have recently proposed that these lesions be classified as primary (of cutaneous origin) or secondary (of extracutaneous origin). These subtypes can present similarly as eczematoid skin lesions and may appear similar on routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Immunohistochemical studies can help differentiate between them. Our current study includes 17 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of vulvar Paget disease. We performed a panel of immunohistochemical stains, including cytokeratin (CK) 7 and 20, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15), and uroplakin-III (UP-III). Of these 17 patients, 14 (80%) had primary intraepithelial cutaneous Paget disease, 13 without invasion and 1 with associated invasion. Three patients had urothelial carcinoma with spread to the vulva, manifesting as secondary vulvar Paget disease. Immunohistochemically, primary vulvar Paget disease is immunoreactive for CK 7 and GCDFP-15, but uncommonly for CK 20. Vulvar Paget disease secondary to anorectal carcinoma demonstrates CK 20 immunoreactivity but is usually nonreactive for CK 7 and consistently nonimmunoreactive for GCDFP-15. Vulvar Paget disease secondary to urothelial carcinoma is immunoreactive for CK 7 and CK 20 but nonimmunoreactive for GCDFP-15. In addition, we propose the use of a new, commercially available antibody, UP-III, which is specific for urothelium and, in our experience, is immunoreactive in secondary vulvar Paget disease of urothelial origin. The distinction between these 3 types of Paget and Paget-like lesions is essential in that the specific diagnosis has a significant influence on current treatment. The difference in surgical approach to the subtypes of vulvar Paget disease justifies classifying them into distinct lesions, which may be aided by the use of immunohistochemistry, including UP-III."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Paget's disease is an intra-epidermal adenocarcinoma seen over the nipple/areola (mammary Paget's disease) or in extramammary body zones, such as the anogenital and perineal skin and the axilla.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is Paget's Disease?", "id": "5aa67b6ad6d6b54f79000010_010", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Paget's disease is an intra-epidermal adenocarcinoma seen over the nipple/areola (mammary Paget's disease) or in extramammary body zones, such as the anogenital and perineal skin and the axilla.

The epidermotropic theory holds that Paget's cells are ductal carcinoma cells that have migrated from the underlying breast parenchyma to the nipple epidermis. According to the in situ transformation theory, the Paget's cells arise as malignant cells in the nipple epidermis independent from any other pathologic process within the breast parenchyma. This theory has been proposed to explain those cases in which there is no underlying mammary carcinoma or when there is a carcinoma remote from the nipple-areola complex.

To gain structural and mechanistic insights to aid the design of new inhibitors, we have determined the crystal structure of OXA-13 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the apo form and in complex with the carbapenem meropenem. The native form consisted of a dimer displaying an overall organisation similar to that found in the closely related enzyme OXA-10. In the acyl-enzyme complex, the positioning of the antibiotic appeared to be ensured mainly by (i) the covalent acyl bond and (ii) a strong salt-bridge involving the carboxylate moiety of the drug. Comparison of the structures of OXA-13 in the apo form and in complex with meropenem revealed an unsuspected flexibility in the region of the essential serine 115 residue, with possible consequences for the catalytic properties of the enzyme. In the apo form, the Ser115 side-chain is oriented outside the active site, whereas the general base Lys70 adopts a conformation that seems to be incompatible with the activation of the catalytic water molecule required for the deacylation step. In the OXA-13:meropenem complex, a 3.5 A movement of the backbone of the 114-116 loop towards the side-chain of Lys70 was observed, which seems to be driven by a displacement of the neighbouring 91-104 loop and which results in the repositioning of the side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser115 toward the catalytic centre. Concomitantly, the side-chain of Lys70 is forced to curve in the direction of the deacylating water molecule, which is then strongly bound and activated by this residue. However, a distance of ca 5 A separates the catalytic water molecule from the acyl carbonyl group of meropenem, a structural feature that accounts for the inhibition of OXA-13 by this drug. Finally, the low level of penicillinase activity revealed by the kinetic analysis of OXA-13 could be related to the specific presence in position 73 of a serine residue located close to the general base Lys70, which results in a decrease of the number of hydrogen-bonding interactions stabilising the catalytic water molecule."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "β-lactamase-mediated antibiotic resistance", "answer_start": 64}], "question": "What is the function of penicillinase, also known as beta lactamase?", "id": "5aae651ffcf456587200000d_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "There is a constant need to identify novel inhibitors to combat β-lactamase-mediated antibiotic resistance.

In particular, while beta-lactamases hydrolyze penicillins very fast, leading to their inactivation, these molecules inhibit d-alanyl-d-alanine peptidases by forming stable covalent penicilloyl enzymes.

Dysregulated MYC expression appears critical to the development of various types of malignancies, and thus factors involved in regulating MYC expression may also play a key role in the pathogenesis of certain cancers. We have cloned one such MYC regulatory factor, termed CTCF, which is a highly evolutionarily conserved-11-zinc finger transcriptional factor possessing multiple DNA sequence specificity. CTCF binds to a number of important regulatory regions within the 5' noncoding sequence of the human MYC oncogene, and it can regulate its transcription in several experimental systems. CTCF mRNA is expressed in cells of multiple different lineages. Enforced ectopic expression of CTCF inhibits cell growth in culture. Southern blot analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with normal human metaphase chromosomes showed that the human CTCF is a single-copy gene situated at chromosome locus 16q22. Cytogenetic studies have pointed out that chromosome abnormalities (deletions) at this locus frequently occur in many different human malignancies, suggesting the presence of one or more tumor suppressor genes in the region. To narrow down their localization, several loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies of chromosome arm 16q in sporadic breast and prostate cancers have been carried out to define the most recurrent and smallest region(s) of overlap (SRO) for commonly deleted chromosome arm 16q material. For CTCF to be considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene associated with tumorigenesis, it should localize within one of the SROs at 16q. Fine-mapping of CTCF has enabled us to assign the CTCF gene to about a 2 centiMorgan (cM) interval of 16q22.1 between the somatic cell hybrid breakpoints CY130(D) and CY4, which is between markers D16S186 (16AC16-101) and D16S496 (AFM214zg5).

BORIS occupancy at 2xCTSes is largely invariant in BORIS-positive cancer cells, with the genomic pattern recapitulating the germline-specific BORIS binding to chromatin. In contrast to the single-motif CTCF target sites (1xCTSes), the 2xCTS elements are preferentially found at active promoters and enhancers, both in cancer and germ cells. 2xCTSes are also enriched in genomic regions that escape histone to protamine replacement in human and mouse sperm. Depletion of the BORIS gene leads to altered transcription of a large number of genes and the differentiation of K562 cells, while the ectopic expression of this CTCF paralog leads to specific changes in transcription in MCF7 cells.CONCLUSIONS: We discover two functionally and structurally different classes of CTCF binding regions, 2xCTSes and 1xCTSes, revealed by their predisposition to bind BORIS.

Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex. Deletion of the CTCF-cohesin binding site caused an inhibition of cell growth and viral genome instability.

Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Subcellular distribution of CTCF and colocalization with cohesins also varied across the cell cycle. Ectopic expression of Rad21 repressed CTCF-regulated transcription of KSHV lytic genes, and a Rad21-CTCF chimeric protein converted CTCF into an efficient transcriptional repressor of KSHV genes normally activated in the G(2) phase.

The effect of leucine on overall translation was also studied.RESULTS: We found that the level of translation was on average 48-73% of controls in both unstimulated and PHA-activated DBA lymphocytes irrespective of mutations in RPS19. The addition of leucine increased the translational level in RPS19-non-mutated DBA cells, but not in cells with an RPS19 mutation. In unstimulated DBA cells, proliferation was significantly impaired in both RPS19-mutated and non-mutated cells, but in both groups could be efficiently activated by PHA. Studies on K562 cells showed that RPS19 mutations affecting RPS19 conserved arginines R56Q and R62Q could significantly inhibit the rate of protein synthesis, indicating the importance of RPS19 in translation.INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that inefficient translation may be the main cause of DBA, and administration of leucine may be beneficial for at least some DBA patients."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Since a fraction of DBA patients have a deficiency in ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), we constructed lentiviral vectors containing the RPS19 gene for overexpression in hematopoietic progenitors from RPS19-deficient DBA patients.", "answer_start": 808}], "question": "In which syndrome is the RPS19 gene most frequently mutated?", "id": "5a896c26fcd1d6a10c000007_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by a specific deficiency in erythroid progenitors.

CD34(+) cells derived from DBA patients showed deficient proliferation in liquid culture containing IL-3, IL-6, and SCF.

To study the molecular pathogenesis of DBA we used siRNA to decrease the level of RPS19 in two human cell lines, HeLa cells and U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells. Cells with reduced RPS19 levels showed a dramatic reduction in the amounts of small 40S ribosome subunits and mature 80S ribosomes and an excess of large 60S subunits. These cells were defective in 18S rRNA production and accumulated 21S and 20S nuclear pre-rRNA molecules, suggesting that RPS19 is required for specific steps in rRNA processing. RPS19 depletion produced a reduction in steady-state levels of RPS6 and RPS16 via a post-transcriptional mechanism while the levels of RPL7 and RPL26 were unaltered, indicating that levels of ribosomal proteins are determined by subunit assembly. This has interesting implications for the pathogenesis of DBA suggesting that deficiency of any of the RPS proteins might have a similar effect and thus may be responsible for causing DBA. Finally in cell lines from DBA patients with mutations we find increased levels of 21S rRNA precursors but no abnormality in the ribosome profile on sucrose gradients or in the steady-state levels of RPS19 suggesting that some cells can partially compensate for the loss of one allele of RPS19.

However, whether there are other vital factors linked to DBA has not been fully clarified. In this study, we compared the whole genome RNA-Seq data of zebrafish embryos injected with RPS19 morpholino (RPS19 MO), RPS19 and p53 morpholino simultaneously (RPS19+p53 MO) and control morpholino (control). We found that genes enriched in the functions of hematological systems, nervous system development and skeletal and muscular disorders had significant differential expression in RPS19 MO embryos compared with controls. Co-inhibition of p53 partially alleviates the abnormalities for RPS19-deficient embryos. However, the hematopoietic genes, which were down-regulated significantly in RPS19 MO embryos, were not completely recovered by the co-inhibition of p53. Furthermore, we identified the genome-wide p53-dependent and -independent genes and pathways.

Knockdown of RPS19 expression by siRNAs impairs 18S rRNA synthesis and formation of 40S subunits and induces apoptosis in HeLa cells. Pre-rRNA processing is altered, which leads to an arrest in the maturation of precursors to the 18S rRNA. Under these conditions, pre-40S particles are not exported to the cytoplasm and accumulate in the nucleoplasm of the cells in perinuclear dots. Consistently, we find that ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar organization is altered in skin fibroblasts from DBA patients bearing mutations in the RPS19 gene. In addition, maturation of the 18S rRNA is also perturbed in cells from a patient bearing no RPS19-related mutation.

Importantly, 2 mutations identified in DBA patients, Val15Phe and Gly127Gln, each of which localized to 1 of the 2 NoS, failed to localize RPS19 to the nucleolus.

Two reviewers independently appraised papers using the Evidence Based Library and Information Practice (EBLIP) appraisal checklist, while the third reviewer resolved discrepancies between appraisals.Results: Ten studies were appraised and the results showed an increase in median nerve cross-sectional area following activity, with a return to normal size within 1 h following activity. Both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with CTS participated, all were small convenience samples. Ultrasonographic measurements of the median nerve were reliable in the four studies reporting this, and the studies demonstrated high quality.Conclusions: Good-quality evidence as identified by the EBLIP appraisal checklist suggests that following hand activity, the median nerve changes in size in the carpal tunnel.

The following variables were considered in the interpretation of sympathetic skin response curve: amplitude, latency and area under the chart, each of them having limited diagnostic value due to inter-and intrasubject variation of these parameters. Vasomotor response was investigated in 2 studies by means of Doppler ultrasound flow examination in digital arteries. Results of both studies showed decreased vasomotor response in carpal tunnel syndrome. The review of current knowledge on sympathetic impairment in carpal tunnel syndrome fails to provide a definitive determination of its range and clinical consequences.

The cross-sectional areas of the proximal and distal median nerve and carpal tunnel were obtained by sonography. The proximal and distal nerve/tunnel indices were obtained by calculating the ratio between the proximal and distal cross-sectional areas of the median nerve to those of the carpal tunnel and multiplying the value by 100.RESULTS: Although the proximal cross-sectional areas of the median nerve and body indices showed statistically significant relationships with weak positive correlations, the proximal and distal areas of the carpal tunnel showed relatively stronger correlations with body indices. Between sexes, there were significant differences in the proximal median nerve cross-sectional area (mean ± SD: male, 10.48 ± 3.21 mm(2); female, 8.81 ± 3.21 mm(2); P < .05) and proximal carpal tunnel area (male, 182.50 ± 21.15 mm(2); female, 151.23 ± 21.14 mm(2); P < .05).

No significant differences were found in cardiac function or blood pressure among any group. However, HFD rats showed cardiac and vascular fibrosis and enhanced levels of superoxide anion (O2(-)), collagen I and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in heart and aorta and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in aorta, effects that were attenuated by LOX inhibition. Interestingly, BAPN also prevented the increase in circulating leptin levels detected in HFD fed animals. Leptin increased protein levels of collagen I, TGF-β and CTGF, Akt phosphorylation and O2(-) production in both cardiac myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells in culture, while LOX inhibition ameliorated these alterations. LOX knockdown also attenuated leptin-induced collagen I production in cardiovascular cells. Our findings indicate that LOX inhibition attenuates the fibrosis and the oxidative stress induced by a HFD on the cardiovascular system.

LOX genes expanded during metazoan evolution resulting in two superfamilies, LOXL2/L3/L4 and LOX/L1/L5.

In a randomized, crossover study, 12 fasting healthy volunteers each received 1,000 mg of oral valaciclovir and a 1-h intravenous infusion of 350 mg of acyclovir. The mean absolute bioavailability of acyclovir was 54.2%, a value three to five times that obtained previously with oral acyclovir. A similar estimate of 51.3% was made from urinary recovery of acyclovir. In the second study, four fasting volunteers received a single oral dose of 1,000 mg of [14C]valaciclovir. The majority of plasma radioactivity was accounted for by acyclovir, with very low plasma valaciclovir concentrations (mean maximum concentration of drug in plasma = 0.19 microM), which were undetectable after 3 h postdose. By 168 h, more than 90% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered, with approximately 45% in urine and 475 in feces. More than 99% of the radioactivity recovered in urine corresponded to acyclovir and its known metabolites, 9-(carboxymethoxymethyl)guanine and 8-hydroxy-9- [(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine, with valaciclovir accounting for less than 0.5% of the dose. Acyclovir, but no valaciclovir, was detected in fecal samples.

The possibility that altered cellular localization of the R151C and R160W variant receptors could underlie their association with RHC was therefore considered.

Melanin has two types: eumelanin which is dark brown or even black and red/orange pheomelanin. The second one is mostly observed in red-headed which is caused by R allele. The DNA damage occurs more easily because of worse protecting ability of pheomelanin. Moreover this allele is connected with inefficient DNA repair. People with R allele have not only flaming red hairstyle but also very fair skin (often with freckles) and blue eyes. Unfortunately this phenotype is more exposed to harmful effects of UV rays. It means that too extensive exposition to solar light leads to sunburn and development of cancerous skin diseases with melanoma as the worst.

Considering the strong metabolic demands imposed by hypoxia, we hypothesized that a shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would improve adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Correlations between serum free fatty acid and lactate concentrations in Tibetan groups living at high altitude and putatively selected haplotypes provide insight into this hypothesis. An EPAS1 haplotype that exhibits a signal of positive selection is significantly associated with increased lactate concentration, the product of anaerobic glycolysis.

We looked across each chromosome to identify genomic regions with previously unknown function with respect to altitude phenotypes. In addition, groups of genes functioning in oxygen metabolism and sensing were examined to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude. Applying four population genetic statistics commonly used for detecting signatures of natural selection, we identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in these two populations (Andeans and Tibetans) separately. The Tibetan and Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct from one another, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. However, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations. Our results indicate that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. These data suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaption and provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies necessary to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "(or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively.", "answer_start": 565}], "question": "Which genes are responsible for the high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans?", "id": "5ace20fa0340b9f05800000c_021", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Genetic studies of Tibetans, an ethnic group with a long-lasting presence on the Tibetan Plateau which is known as the highest plateau in the world, may offer a unique opportunity to understand the biological adaptations of human beings to high-altitude environments. We conducted a genome-wide study of 1,000,000 genetic variants in 46 Tibetans (TBN) and 92 Han Chinese (HAN) for identifying the signals of high-altitude adaptations (HAAs) in Tibetan genomes. We discovered the most differentiated variants between TBN and HAN at chromosome 1q42.2 and 2p21. EGLN1 (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively. Strong positive correlations were also observed between the frequency of TBN-dominant haplotypes in the two gene regions and altitude in East Asian populations. Linkage disequilibrium and further haplotype network analyses of world-wide populations suggested the antiquity of the TBN-dominant haplotypes and long-term persistence of the natural selection. Finally, a \"dominant haplotype carrier\" hypothesis could describe the role of the two genes in HAA. All of our population genomic and statistical analyses indicate that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are most likely responsible for HAA of Tibetans. Interestingly, one each but not both of the two genes were also identified by three recent studies. We reanalyzed the available data and found the escaped top signal (EPAS1) could be recaptured with data quality control and our approaches. Based on this experience, we call for more attention to be paid to controlling data quality and batch effects introduced in public data integration.

Here we analyse genotype data for the Nepalese Sherpa, and find that Tibetans are a mixture of ancestral populations related to the Sherpa and Han Chinese. EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders. Accordingly, the Sherpa and Tibetans share adaptive haemoglobin traits. This admixture-mediated adaptation shares important features with adaptive introgression.

The mechanisms that afford adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, however, remain unclear. Considering the strong metabolic demands imposed by hypoxia, we hypothesized that a shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would improve adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Correlations between serum free fatty acid and lactate concentrations in Tibetan groups living at high altitude and putatively selected haplotypes provide insight into this hypothesis. An EPAS1 haplotype that exhibits a signal of positive selection is significantly associated with increased lactate concentration, the product of anaerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, the putatively advantageous PPARA haplotype is correlated with serum free fatty acid concentrations, suggesting a possible decrease in the activity of fatty acid oxidation.

The results found that Hb concentration in Himalayan highlanders was systemically lower than those reported for Andean natives and lowland immigrants. These comparative data demonstrated that a healthy native population may successfully reside at high altitude without a significant elevation in Hb, and the lower Hb levels of Himalayan highlanders than those of migrated lowlanders and Andean natives are an example of favourable adaptation over the generations. In addition, excessive polycythemia has frequently been used as a marker of chronic mountain sickness (CMS). Altitude populations who have a higher Hb concentration also have a higher incidence of CMS. The low Hb in Himalayans suggested as showing adaptation over many generations in Tibetan stock. Recent work in Tibet, suggested that Tibetans there may have adapted to high altitude as a result of evolutionary pressure selecting for genes which give an advantage at altitude. All of the population genomic and statistical analysis indicated that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are mostly likely responsible for high altitude adaptation and closely related to low Hb concentration in Tibetans.

In this work, we tested whether any correlation exists between the expression of UCP1 and UCP3 in BAT by quantification of protein amounts in mouse tissues at physiological conditions, in cold-acclimated and UCP1 knockout mice. Quantification using recombinant UCP3 revealed that the UCP3 amount in BAT (0.51ng/(μg total tissue protein)) was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that in muscles and heart. Cold-acclimated mice showed an approximate three-fold increase in UCP3 abundance in BAT in comparison to mice in thermoneutral conditions.

UCP3 abundance decreased even more in cold-acclimated UCP1 knockout mice. Protein quantification in UCP3 knockout mice revealed no compensatory increase in UCP1 or UCP2 expression.
