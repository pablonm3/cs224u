Vanoxerine is a drug that is free of adverse cardiac events in normal volunteers, yet is a potent blocker of the hERG (hK(v)11.1) cardiac potassium channel. Consequently,we hypothesized that vanoxerine might also be a potent blocker of cardiac calcium (Ca) and sodium (Na) currents, and would not affect transmural dispersion of repolarization.METHODS: The whole cell patch clamp technique was used to measure currents from cloned ion channels overexpressed in stable cell lines and single ventricular myocytes. We measured intracellular action potentials from canine ventricular wedges and Purkinje fibers using sharp microelectrode technique.RESULTS: We found that vanoxerine was a potent hK(v)11.1 blocker, and at submicromolar concentrations, it blocked Ca and Na currents in a strongly frequency-dependent manner. In the canine ventricular wedge preparation vanoxerine did not significantly affect transmural action potential waveforms, QT interval or transmural dispersion of repolarization.CONCLUSIONS: Vanoxerine (1) is a potent blocker of cardiac hERG, Na and Ca channels; (2) block is strongly frequency-dependent especially for Na and Ca channels; and (3) transmural dispersion of ventricular repolarization is unaffected. The multichannel block and repolarization uniformity resemble the effects of amiodarone, the exemplar atrial fibrillation drug.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that oral dosing of vanoxerine would first terminate induced atrial flutter (AFL) and atrial fibrillation (AF), and then prevent their reinduction.METHODS: In 5 dogs with sterile pericarditis, on the fourth day after creating the pericarditis, we performed electrophysiologic (EP) studies at baseline, measuring atrial excitability, refractoriness (AERP), and conduction time (CT) when pacing from the right atrial appendage, Bachmann's bundle (BB), and the posteroinferior left atrium at cycle lengths (CLs) of 400, 300, and 200 ms. Then, after induction of AFL or AF, all dogs received hourly oral doses of vanoxerine: 90 mg, followed by 180 mg and 270 mg. Blood was obtained to determine plasma vanoxerine concentrations at baseline, every 30 minutes, when neither AFL nor AF were inducible, and, finally, 1 hour after the 270 mg dose. Then we repeated the baseline EP studies.RESULTS: Four dogs had inducible, sustained AFL, and 1 dog only had induced, nonsustained AF. In 4 AFL episodes, oral vanoxerine terminated the AFL and then rendered it noninducible after an average of 111 minutes (range 75-180 minutes) after the first dose was administered. The mean vanoxerine plasma level at the point of noninducibility was 84 ng/mL, with a narrow range of 76-99 ng/mL. In the dog with induced, nonsustained AF, it was no longer inducible at a drug level of 75 ng/mL. Vanoxerine did not significantly (1) prolong the AERP except at BB, and then only at the faster pacing CLs; (2) change atrial excitability thresholds; (3) prolong atrial conduction time, the PR interval, the QRS complex or the QT interval.CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered vanoxerine effectively terminated AFL and rendered it noninducible. It also suppressed inducibility of nonsustained AF. These effects occurred at consistent plasma drug levels.

This was correlated with Sanger sequencing of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 genes.RESULTS: Seventeen patients were examined, including one with ectopia lentis et pupillae. Echocardiography and skeletal examination revealed no sign of systemic disorders associated with EL, in particular Marfan syndrome (MFS). Nine patients (52.9%) were found to have mutations in ADAMTSL4, including four novel nonsense mutations. Four patients (25%) were found to have novel FBN1 mutations, not previously reported as causing classical Marfan syndrome. One additional patient was found to have an FBN1 mutation previously reported in classical MFS. Four patients (25%) were found to have no mutations in either gene. Median age of diagnosis of EL was 35 years in patients with FBN1 mutations and 2 years in patients with ADAMTSL4 mutations (P < 0.01). Mean axial length was 22.74 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.3-24.2) (FBN1) and 27.54 mm (95% CI: 24.2-30.9) (ADAMTSL4) (P < 0.01).

We found that JSRV induces lung tumors in goats with macroscopic and histopathological features that dramatically differ from those in sheep. However, the origins of the tumor cells in the two species are identical. Interestingly, in experimentally infected lambs and goat kids, we revealed major differences in the number of virus-infected cells at early stages of infection. These differences were not related to the number of available target cells for virus infection and cell transformation or the presence of a host-specific immune response toward JSRV. Indeed, we also found that goats possess transcriptionally active endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs) that likely influence the host immune response toward the exogenous JSRV.

It has been suggested that non-coding RPS19 sequence variants contribute to the considerable clinical variability in red cell aplasia.

We provide here a catalog of the considerable, previously unrecognized degree of variation in this region. We identified 73 variations (65 SNPs, 8 indels) that all are located outside of the RPS19 open reading frame, and of which 67.1% are classified as novel. We hypothesize that specific alleles in non-coding regions of RPS19 could alter the binding of regulatory proteins or transcription factors. Therefore, we carried out an extensive analysis to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). A series of putative interaction sites coincide with detected variants. Sixteen of the corresponding transcription factors are of particular interest, as they are housekeeping genes or show a direct link to hematopoiesis, tumorigenesis or leukemia (e.g. GATA-1/2, PU.1, MZF-1).CONCLUSIONS: Specific alleles at predicted TFBSs may alter the expression of RPS19, modify an important interaction between transcription factors with overlapping TFBS or remove an important stimulus for hematopoiesis. We suggest that the detected interactions are of importance for hematopoiesis and could provide new insights into individual response to treatment."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Deletion of PKC1 relieves the repression of both ribosomal protein and rRNA genes that occurs in response to a defect in the secretory pathway.", "answer_start": 885}], "question": "Does GATA-1 regulate ribosomal protein genes?", "id": "58e782fd3e8b6dc87c000006_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The balanced growth of a cell requires the integration of major systems such as DNA replication, membrane biosynthesis, and ribosome formation.

We evaluated data in four variant databases (HGMD, UMD-FBN1, ClinVar, and UniProt) according to the diagnostic criteria for MFS and compared the results with the classification of each variant in the four databases.RESULTS: None of the 23 variants was clearly associated with MFS, even though all classifications in the databases stated otherwise.CONCLUSION: A genetic diagnosis of MFS cannot reliably be based on current variant databases because they contain incorrectly interpreted conclusions on variants. Variants must be evaluated by time-consuming review of the background material in the databases and by combining these data with expert knowledge on MFS. This is a major problem because we expect even more genetic test results in the near future as a result of the reduced cost and process time for next-generation sequencing.Genet Med 18 1, 98-102."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The studies on heart rate variability (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations.", "answer_start": 12}], "question": "Which gene mutations cause the Marfan syndrome?", "id": "58d8e6818acda3452900000a_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: The studies on heart rate variability (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations.METHODS: Among 18 MS patients with the phenotype of MS meeting inclusion criteria 15 have had a FBN1 gene mutation.

In an effort to evaluate variant causality, FBN1 databases are often used. We evaluated the current databases regarding FBN1 variants and validated associated phenotype records with a new Marfan syndrome geno-phenotyping tool called the Marfan score.METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated four databases (UMD-FBN1, ClinVar, the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), and Uniprot) containing 2,250 FBN1 variants supported by 4,904 records presented in 307 references. The Marfan score calculated for phenotype data from the records quantified variant associations with Marfan syndrome phenotype. We calculated a Marfan score for 1,283 variants, of which we confirmed the database diagnosis of Marfan syndrome in 77.1%. This represented only 35.8% of the total registered variants; 18.5-33.3% (UMD-FBN1 versus HGMD) of variants associated with Marfan syndrome in the databases could not be confirmed by the recorded phenotype.CONCLUSION: FBN1 databases can be imprecise and incomplete. Data should be used with caution when evaluating FBN1 variants. At present, the UMD-FBN1 database seems to be the biggest and best curated; therefore, it is the most comprehensive database.

The pathogenic mechanism is thought to be a dominant negative effect of a mutant protein on microfibril assembly, although direct evidence is lacking. A significant group of disease-causing FBN1 mutations are cysteine substitutions within EGF domains that are predicted to cause misfolding by removal of disulphide bonds that stabilize the native domain fold. We have studied three missense mutations (C1117Y, C1129Y and G1127S) to investigate the effect of misfolding on the trafficking of fibrillin-1 from fibroblast cells. We demonstrate that both C1117Y and C1129Y, expressed as recombinant fragments of fibrillin-1, are retained and accumulate within the cell. Both undergo core glycosylation but lack the complex glycosylation observed in the secreted wild-type fragment, suggesting retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show association with the ER chaperone calreticulin, but not calnexin, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78/BiP) or protein disulfide isomerase.

The protein elastin makes up the highly insoluble amorphous component and is responsible for the elastic properties. Elastin is found throughout the vertebrate kingdom and possesses an unusual chemical composition rich in glycine, proline, and hydrophobic amino acids, consonant with its characteristic physical properties. The 72-kDa biosynthetic precursor, tropoelastin, is secreted into the extracellular space where it becomes highly cross-linked into a rubber-like network through the activity of the copper-requiring enzyme lysyl oxidase. Analysis of the elastin gene has demonstrated that hydrophobic and cross-linking domains are encoded in separate exons and that there is significant alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms of tropoelastin. The elastin gene promoter contains many potential binding sites for various modulating factors indicative of a complex pattern of transcriptional regulation. The microfibrils contain several proteins, including fibrillin, and probably act as an organizing scaffold in the formation of the elastin network.

Adults with uncontrolled persistent asthma who are receiving medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting β2 agonist require additional treatment options as add-on therapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab as add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma on medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting β2 agonist, irrespective of baseline eosinophil count.METHODS: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, pivotal phase 2b clinical trial at 174 study sites across 16 countries or regions. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with an asthma diagnosis for 12 months or more based on the Global Initiative for Asthma 2009 Guidelines receiving treatment with medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting β2 agonist were eligible for participation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks, or placebo, over a 24-week period. The primary endpoint was change from baseline at week 12 in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 in L) in patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of at least 300 eosinophils per μL assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety outcomes were assessed in all patients that received at least one dose or part of a dose of study drug. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01854047, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-000856-16.FINDINGS: 769 patients (158 in the placebo group and 611 in the dupilumab groups) received at least one dose of study drug. In the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per μL, the greatest increases (200 mg every 2 weeks, p=0·0008; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p=0·0063) in FEV1 compared with placebo were observed at week 12 with doses every 2 weeks in the 300 mg group (mean change 0·39 L [SE 0·05]; mean difference 0·21 [95% CI 0·06-0·36; p=0·0063]) and in the 200 mg group (mean change 0·43 L [SE 0·05]; mean difference 0·26 [0·11-0·40; p=0·0008]) compared with placebo (0·18 L [SE 0·05]). Similar significant increases were observed in the overall population and in the fewer than 300 eosinophils per μL subgroup (overall population: 200 mg every 2 weeks, p<0·0001; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p<0·0001; <300 eosinophils per μL: 200 mg every 2 weeks, p=0·0034; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p=0·0086), and were maintained to week 24. Likewise, dupilumab every 2 weeks produced the greatest reductions in annualised rates of exacerbation in the overall population (70-70·5%), the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per μL (71·2-80·7%), and the subgroup with fewer than 300 eosinophils per μL (59·9-67·6%). The most common adverse events with dupilumab compared with placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (33-41% vs 35%) and injection-site reactions (13-26% vs 13%).INTERPRETATION: Dupilumab increased lung function and reduced severe exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma irrespective of baseline eosinophil count and had a favourable safety profile, and hence in addition to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting β2-agonist therapy could improve the lives of patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma compared with standard therapy alone.FUNDING: Sanofi-Genzyme and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The actin cytoskeleton is especially polymorphic, as actin filaments can form multiple higher order assemblies performing different functions. Structural information about cytoskeleton organization is critical for understanding its functions and mechanisms underlying various forms of cellular activity. Because of the nanometer-scale thickness of cytoskeletal fibers, electron microscopy (EM) is a key tool to determine the structure of the cytoskeleton. This article describes application of rotary shadowing (or metal replica) EM for visualization of the cytoskeleton. The procedure is applicable to thin cultured cells growing on glass coverslips and consists of detergent extraction of cells to expose their cytoskeleton, chemical fixation to provide stability, ethanol dehydration and critical point drying to preserve three-dimensionality, rotary shadowing with platinum to create contrast, and carbon coating to stabilize replicas. This technique provides easily interpretable three-dimensional images, in which individual cytoskeletal fibers are clearly resolved, and individual proteins can be identified by immunogold labeling. More importantly, replica EM is easily compatible with live cell imaging, so that one can correlate the dynamics of a cell or its components, e.g., expressed fluorescent proteins, with high resolution structural organization of the cytoskeleton in the same cell."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "European honey bee (Apis mellifera)", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "What is the genus for the common European honey bee?", "id": "58e23ec66fddd3e83e000010_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Aethina tumida is a serious pest of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) in North America and Australia.

Sequence based domain predictions, surface accessibilities on substitution & conserved catalytic sites with statistical drifts, as well as thermal stability changes for the mutations and the interaction analysis of Tafazzin were performed. Crystal structure of Tafazzin is not yet resolved experimentally, therefore 3D coordinates of Tafazzin and its mutants were spawned through homology modeling. Energetically minimized and structurally validated models were used for comparative docking simulations. We analyzed active site geometry of the models in addition to calculating overall substrate binding efficiencies for each of the enzyme-ligand complex deduced from binding energies instead of comparing only the docking scores. Also, individual binding energies of catalytic residues on conserved HX4D motif of Acyltransferase superfamily present in Tafazzins were estimated.

Using concurrent electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI), we recently showed that epileptiform discharges in LGS recruit large-scale networks that normally support key cognitive processes. In LGS, given that epileptic activity engages cognitive networks, and cognition is pervasively impaired, we hypothesized that cognitive network interactions in LGS are persistently abnormal.METHODS: We studied 15 LGS patients (mean age ± 1 standard deviation [SD] = 28.7 ± 10.6 years) and 17 healthy controls (mean age ± 1 SD = 27.6 ± 6.6 years) using task-free EEG-fMRI. Four networks of interest (default-mode, dorsal attention, executive control, and anterior salience) were defined using group-level independent components analysis (ICA). Functional connectivity within and between networks was determined for each subject, and then LGS network interactions were compared to network behavior in the control group. To test whether group differences were present in periods without scalp-detectable epileptiform discharges (i.e., persistent), we separately assessed discharge-affected and discharge-unaffected epochs in six patients with sufficient data for this analysis.RESULTS: In LGS, cognitive networks showed (1) reduced within-network integration, including weaker connectivity within the default-mode network, and (2) impaired between-network segregation, including stronger connectivity between the default-mode and dorsal attention networks. Abnormal interactions were present during fMRI periods with and without discharges, indicating that impaired network behavior may endure during periods without scalp-detectable epileptic activity.SIGNIFICANCE: In LGS, cognitive network interactions are persistently abnormal. Given that cognition typically worsens with the onset of LGS, and may improve after seizure control, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the epileptic process in LGS may initiate and perhaps sustain abnormal network behavior. We propose that epileptic encephalopathy may be a consequence of persistently disrupted cognitive network interactions.Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 International League Against Epilepsy."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "Is Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome usually diagnosed in older adults?", "id": "58dbb4f08acda3452900001a_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "There is scanty data regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the modified Atkins diet in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

It occurs more frequently in males and onset is usually before the age of eight, with a peak between three and five years. Late cases occurring in adolescence and early adulthood have rarely been reported. Language is frequently affected, with both slowness in ideation and expression in addition to difficulties of motor dysfunction. Severe behavioural disorders (for example hyperactivity, aggressiveness and autistic tendencies) and personality disorders are nearly always present. There is also a tendency for psychosis to develop with time. The long-term prognosis is poor; although the epilepsy often improves, complete seizure freedom is rare and conversely the mental and psychiatric disorders tend to worsen with time.OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of pharmaceutical therapies used to treat Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in terms of control of seizures and adverse effects. Many people who suffer from this syndrome will already be receiving other antiepileptic medications at the time of their entry into a trial. However, for the purpose of this review we will only consider the effect of the single therapeutic agent being trialed (often as add-on therapy).SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (February 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009), and MEDLINE (1950 to January 2009). We also searched EMBASE (1980 to March 2003). We imposed no language restrictions. We searched the ISRCTN register for ongoing trials and in addition, we contacted pharmaceutical companies and colleagues in the field to seek any unpublished or ongoing studies.SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the administration of drug therapy to patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data. Analysis included assessing study quality, as well as statistical analysis of the effects on overall seizure rates and effects on specific seizure types (e.g. drop attacks), adverse effects and mortality.MAIN RESULTS: We found seven RCTs, but were unable to perform any meta-analysis, because each trial looked at different populations, different therapies and considered different outcomes.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The optimum treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome remains uncertain and no study to date has shown any one drug to be highly efficacious; rufinamide, lamotrigine, topiramate and felbamate may be helpful as add-on therapy. Until further research has been undertaken, clinicians will need to continue to consider each patient individually, taking into account the potential benefit of each therapy weighed against the risk of adverse effects."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "AIMS: To prospectively validate the SYNTAX Score II and forecast the outcomes of the randomized Evaluation of the Xience Everolimus-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) Trial.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Which treatment methods were compared in the EXCEL Trial?", "id": "5880b583c872c95565000005_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "AIMS: To prospectively validate the SYNTAX Score II and forecast the outcomes of the randomized Evaluation of the Xience Everolimus-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) Trial.METHODS AND RESULTS: Evaluation of the Xience Everolimus Eluting Stent vs. Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization is a prospective, randomized multicenter trial designed to establish the efficacy and safety of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the everolimus-eluting stent compared with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in subjects with unprotected left-main coronary artery (ULMCA) disease and low-intermediate anatomical SYNTAX scores (<33).

Recent meta-analyses of four small randomized trials revealed a similar rate of 1-year major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, higher rates of target vessel revascularization and lower stroke rates for PCI. Pooling randomized patients studies stratified by lesion complexity strengthened the hypothesis that CABG is better in more complex LMCAD patients.

The ongoing Evaluation of XIENCE V Everolimus Eluting Stent System Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) trial is expected to provide a better answer on the optimal treatment strategy for LMCAD patients.

To account for confounders, outcome parameters underwent extensive statistical adjustment.RESULTS: The unadjusted incidence of death/MI/CVA was similar between PCI and CABG (12.7% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.892), while MACCE were higher in the PCI group compared to the CABG group (27.0% vs. 11.8%, P < 0.001).

Gene discoveries have also provided insights into high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis and remodeling. Interestingly, at least half of these key molecular genetic studies were initiated with the benefit of prior knowledge of relevant proteins. In addition, multiple important findings originated from studies in mouse, and from other types of non-genetic approaches. Although it appears by now that the main lipid pathways have been uncovered, and that only modulators or adaptor proteins such as those encoded by LDLRAP1, APOA5, ANGPLT3/4, and PCSK9 are currently being discovered, genome wide association studies (GWAS) in particular have implicated many new loci based on statistical analyses; these may prove to have equally large impacts on lipoprotein traits as gene products that are already known. On the other hand, since 2004 - and particularly since 2010 when massively parallel sequencing has become de rigeur - no major new insights into genes governing lipid metabolism have been reported. This is probably because the etiologies of true Mendelian lipid disorders with overt clinical complications have been largely resolved. In the meantime, it has become clear that proving the importance of new candidate genes is challenging. This could be due to very low frequencies of large impact variants in the population. It must further be emphasized that functional genetic studies, while necessary, are often difficult to accomplish, making it hazardous to upgrade a variant that is simply associated to being definitively causative. Also, it is clear that applying a monogenic approach to dissect complex lipid traits that are mostly of polygenic origin is the wrong way to proceed. The hope is that large-scale data acquisition combined with sophisticated computerized analyses will help to prioritize and select the most promising candidate genes for future research.

We conducted this cross-sectional study to evaluate the awareness and perspectives on SUDEP among adult patients with epilepsy.METHODS: One hundred five consecutive adult patients with epilepsy, referred to the Epilepsy Clinic of a tertiary hospital between October 2012 and November 2013, were surveyed to ascertain their views and understanding of SUDEP. The data were analyzed using logistic regression to explore the association between patients' awareness of SUDEP and characteristics such as age, gender, duration of epilepsy, level of education, and employment.RESULTS: Awareness of SUDEP among adult patients with epilepsy was poor (14.3%). However, the vast majority (89.5%) wished to be informed about SUDEP, and 59% requested detailed information. The treating neurologist was considered to be the most appropriate source of SUDEP information by 85.6% of patients.

In this retrospective study, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monoamine metabolites and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) were evaluated in 263 baboons of a pedigreed colony. CSF monoamine abnormalities have been linked to reduced seizure thresholds, behavioral abnormalities and SUDEP in various animal models of epilepsy. The levels of 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenylglycol, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid and homovanillic acid in CSF samples drawn from the cisterna magna were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. These levels were compared between baboons with seizures (SZ), craniofacial trauma (CFT) and asymptomatic, control (CTL) baboons, between baboons with abnormal and normal EEG studies. We hypothesized that the CSF levels of major monoaminergic metabolites (i.e., dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine) associate with the baboons' electroclinical status and thus can be used as clinical biomarkers applicable to seizures/epilepsy. However, despite apparent differences in metabolite levels between the groups, usually lower in SZ and CFT baboons and in baboons with abnormal EEG studies, we did not find any statistically significant differences using a logistic regression analysis. Significant correlations between the metabolite levels, especially between 5-HIAA and HVA, were preserved in all electroclinical groups. While we were not able to demonstrate significant differences in monoamine metabolites in relation to seizures or EEG markers of epilepsy, we cannot exclude the monoaminergic system as a potential source of pathogenesis in epilepsy and SUDEP. A prospective study evaluating serial CSF monoamine levels in baboons with recently witnessed seizures, and evaluation of abnormal expression and function of monoaminergic receptors and transporters within epilepsy-related brain regions, may impact the electroclinical status."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) refers to the sudden death of a seemingly healthy individual with epilepsy, usually occurring during, or immediately after, a tonic-clonic seizure.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What condition is usually represented by the acronym SUDEP?", "id": "58dbb8968acda3452900001b_017", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) refers to the sudden death of a seemingly healthy individual with epilepsy, usually occurring during, or immediately after, a tonic-clonic seizure.

SUDEP is particularly difficult to investigate in research studies for several reasons, including its relatively low incidence, its unpredictable occurrence often in unwitnessed settings, and its low rate of complete autopsy examinations. Over the past two decades, two complementary definitions have been used in most SUDEP studies, but often with variations. We propose here a unified SUDEP definition and classification to resolve current ambiguities and to retrieve cases that would not have been further studied if the previous definitions were used. The proposed Unified SUDEP Definition and Classification contains, in addition to concepts inherent in the previous definitions, nine main recommendations. (1) The word \"unexpected,\" and not the word \"unexplained,\" should be uniformly used in the term SUDEP. (2) The SUDEP category should be applied when appropriate, whether or not a terminal seizure is known to have occurred. (3) The \"Possible SUDEP\" category should be used only for cases with competing causes of death, with cases left unclassified when data are insufficient to reasonably permit their classification. (4) Cases that would otherwise fulfill the definition of SUDEP should be designated as \"SUDEP Plus\" when evidence indicates that a preexisting condition, known before or after autopsy, could have contributed to the death, which otherwise is classified as SUDEP (e.g., coronary insufficiency with no evidence of myocardial infarction or long-QT syndrome with no documented primary ventricular arrhythmia leading to death). (5) To be considered SUDEP, the death should have occurred within 1 h from the onset of a known terminal event. (6) For status epilepticus as an exclusion criterion for SUDEP, the duration of seizure activity should be 30 min or more. (7) A specific category of SUDEP due to asphyxia should not be designated, the distinction being largely impractical on circumstantial or autopsy evidence, with more than one mechanism likely to be contributory in many cases. (8) Death occurring in water but without circumstantial or autopsy evidence of submersion should be classified as \"Possible SUDEP.\" If any evidence of submersion is present, the death should not be classified as SUDEP. (9) A category of \"Near-SUDEP\" should be agreed to include cases in which cardiorespiratory arrest was reversed by resuscitation efforts with subsequent survival for more than 1 h. Scenarios that demonstrate the basis for each SUDEP category are described. If disagreement exists about which category fits a particular case, we suggest the use of consensus decision by a panel of informed reviewers to adjudicate the classification of the case."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)", "answer_start": 86}], "question": "What condition is usually represented by the acronym SUDEP?", "id": "58dbb8968acda3452900001b_021", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "This review attempts to provide up-to-date quantitative data from published reports on sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) appearing on Medline and, especially, to provide a means to predict the probability of SUDEP in a given patient.

Nocturnal seizures are reported to be a risk factor for SUDEP. People with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) have seizures predominantly or exclusively during sleep, often many times per night. The present study aimed to assess whether NFLE represents a high-risk condition for SUDEP.METHODS: The present study retrospectively assessed the incidence of SUDEP in a cohort reconstructed from a dedicated database of consecutive patients referred to the Epilepsy and Sleep Centres of the Institute of Neurological Sciences of Bologna from 1980 to 2012 with: (1) a diagnosis of NFLE, (2) at least 90% of seizures during sleep, and (3) at least one-year of follow-up.RESULTS: One hundred and three people were included. The median time from seizure onset to last observation was 26 years, equal to a follow-up of 2789 person-years. One person died of SUDEP during the follow-up period. The incidence rate of SUDEP was 0.36 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 0.01 to 2.0).CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SUDEP in the participant population was not higher than the rates previously reported in prevalent epilepsy populations (0.4 to 2.3 per 1000 person-years).

When it occurs, SUDEP usually follows a generalised tonic-clonic seizure. Unresponsiveness, apnoea, and cardiac arrest occur in SUDEP, rather than the typical gradual recovery. The great majority of tonic-clonic seizures occur without difficulty and how the rare seizure associated with SUDEP differs from others is unknown.Three mechanisms have been proposed for SUDEP: cardiac arrhythmia, neurogenic pulmonary oedema, and postictal suppression of brainstem respiratory centres leading to central apnoea. Recent studies have found that the incidence of SUDEP increases with the severity of epilepsy in the population studied. The duration of epilepsy, number of tonic-clonic seizures, mental retardation, and simultaneous treatment with more than two antiepileptic drugs are independent risk factors for SUDEP. Some studies have reported that carbamazepine use, carbamazepine toxicity, and frequent, rapid changes in carbamazepine levels, may be associated with SUDEP. Other evidence indicates that carbamazepine could potentially increase the risk for SUDEP by causing arrhythmia or by altering cardiac autonomic function. However, this evidence is tenuous and most studies have not found an association between the use of carbamazepine or any other individual antiepileptic drug and SUDEP. There is little information regarding antiepileptic drugs other than phenytoin and carbamazepine. The incidence of SUDEP with gabapentin, tiagabine, and lamotrigine clinical development programmes is in the range found in other populations with refractory epilepsy. This suggests that these individual antiepileptic drugs are no more likely to cause SUDEP than antiepileptic drugs in general. Best current evidence indicates that the risk of SUDEP can be decreased by aggressive treatment of tonic-clonic seizures with as few antiepileptic drugs as necessary to achieve complete control. At present there is no strong reason to avoid any particular antiepileptic drug. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential role of individual antiepileptic drugs in SUDEP and establish clinical relevance, if any. These studies may be challenging to conduct and interpret because SUDEP is relatively uncommon and large numbers will be necessary to narrow confidence intervals to determine the clinical relevance. Also adjustments will be needed to account for the potent risks associated with other independent factors."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "sudden and unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) ", "answer_start": 40}], "question": "What condition is usually represented by the acronym SUDEP?", "id": "58dbb8968acda3452900001b_024", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors for sudden and unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in a high-risk population, i.e. patients treated in a Dutch tertiary referral center for epilepsy.METHODS: All patients who died between January 1999 and April 2004 while under treatment of the epilepsy center were identified.

This review summarizes data on the relationship between these neurocardiac genes and SUDEP, discussing their brain-heart expression patterns and genotype-phenotype correlations in mouse models and people with epilepsy. These neurocardiac genes represent good first candidates for evaluation as genomic biomarkers of SUDEP in future studies.

This phenomenon is called sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and the term is used when sudden death occurs in an otherwise reasonably healthy person with epilepsy and the autopsy is unrevealing. In most cases, SUDEP occurs during sleep and is unwitnessed. Risk factors for SUDEP include the presence or number of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), nocturnal seizures, young age at epilepsy onset, longer duration of epilepsy, dementia, absence of cerebrovascular disease, asthma, male gender, symptomatic aetiology of epilepsy and alcohol abuse. Suggested factors predisposing to SUDEP have included long-QT-related mutations, impaired serotonergic brain stem control of respiration, altered autonomic control and seizures with a pronounced postictal suppression and respiratory compromise. Final events that may lead up to SUDEP are a postictal CNS shutdown with pronounced EEG suppression, ictal or postictal apnoea, and ictal cardiac arrhythmia. It is unknown whether antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) modify the risk for SUDEP. Studies have consistently found that the presence or number of GTCS is associated with an increased risk for SUDEP. Since continued presence of GTCS clearly necessitates the use of AEDs, both factors must be taken into account to determine whether one or both increases the risk for SUDEP. Some studies suggest that AEDs, such as lamotrigine and carbamazepine, may increase the risk of SUDEP, but rarely adjust for GTCS. Other studies, which have found that AEDs are associated with a decreased SUDEP risk, either adjust for the number of GTCS or are meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials. Studies assessing the impact of AEDs on the risk for SUDEP are limited because SUDEP is a rare event, making randomized clinical trials impossible to conduct. Observational studies focus on whether or not an AED was prescribed. When postmortem AED concentrations are assessed they are usually low or absent, perhaps due to sampling in deceased individuals, making it difficult to fully resolve whether AEDs increase or decrease SUDEP risk. Despite these caveats, the evidence suggests that AEDs are not associated with an increased risk for SUDEP on a population level, although some individuals may be susceptible to effects of AEDs. Recent evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of adjunctive AEDs at efficacious doses provides strong support for AED treatment as mono- or polytherapy to increase seizure control and protect against SUDEP in patients with refractory epilepsy. For patients for whom seizure control is unattainable, supervision or monitoring may prevent SUDEP, though this has never been formally tested."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "udden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause for death in individuals with epilepsy.

Surprisingly, TFIIB serine 65 phosphorylation is required after the phosphorylation of serine 5 of RNA pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) has occurred, but before productive transcription initiation begins. We show that phosphorylation of TFIIB at serine 65 regulates the interaction between TFIIB and the CstF-64 component of the CstF 3' cleavage and polyadenylation complex. This directs the recruitment of CstF (cleavage stimulatory factor) to the terminator and also the recruitment of the CstF and CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor) complexes to the promoter. Our results reveal that phosphorylation of TFIIB is a critical event in transcription that links the gene promoter and terminator and triggers initiation by RNA pol II."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We now show that Pcf11, a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex (CPAC), is also generally required for NRD-dependent transcription termination through the action of its C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting domain (CID)", "answer_start": 167}], "question": "Which proteins does the yeast Cleavage and Polyadenylation Complex contain?", "id": "58add7699ef3c34033000009_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, short noncoding RNA (ncRNA) generated by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) are terminated by the NRD complex consisting of Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1.

Finally, the pcf11-13 and sen1-1 mutant phenotypes are very similar, as both accumulate RNA:DNA hybrids and display Pol II pausing downstream from NRD terminators.

METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of patients who had undergone surgery using an EETTA to the IAC at 2 university tertiary care referral centers during the period from November 2011 to January 2015. RESULTS Ten patients underwent surgery via an EETTA for the treatment of VS in the IAC at the University Hospital of Modena or the University Hospital of Verona. The patients had Koos Grade I or II tumors and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Class D hearing status preoperatively. Gross-total resection was achieved in all patients. No major complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage or hemorrhage were reported. In 7 of 10 (70%) patients, facial nerve function was normal immediately after surgery (Rough Grading System [RGS] Grade I). Two patients presented with a transitory facial palsy immediately after surgery (RGS Grade II-III) but experienced complete recovery during the follow-up period. The mean follow-up was 10 months. CONCLUSIONS The EETTA proved to be successful for the removal of VS or meningioma involving the cochlea, fundus, and IAC, with possible lower complication rates and less invasive procedures than those for traditional microscopic approaches.

VS was characterized by its size (Koos classification) and the presence or not of a cystic component. Hearing was classified according to the Gardner Robertson grading. The preoperative workup included an audiogram, computerized video nystagmography (VNG) with caloric testing, gaze study, rotatory tests, click-evoked cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential measurements (cVEMPs), and subjective visual vertical test. Patients were asked to complete a Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Postoperatively, patients were reevaluated on D7 (clinical status), D90 (VNG and DHI), and D180 (DHI).

Early experiments indicated that enhancers located far from the gene promoters are often responsible for mediating gene transcription.

Recent genome-wide investigation of epigenomic marks has indicated that enhancer elements could be enriched for certain epigenomic marks, such as, combinatorial patterns of histone modifications.METHODS: Our efforts in this paper are motivated by these recent advances in epigenomic profiling methods, which have uncovered enhancer-associated chromatin features in different cell types and organisms.

Thalassemia intermedia is a clinical diagnosis that describes a symptomatic but less severe condition than beta-thalassemia major. beta-thalassemia intermedia may arise from several different combinations of alpha- and/or beta-thalassemia mutations. Heterozygous beta-thalassemia is typically characterized by a mild microcytic hypochromic anemia without any significant clinical implications.

Her elevated hemoglobin F level of 83% was associated with heterozygosity for the Xmn I polymorphism upstream of the Ggamma-globin gene. Southern blot analysis at the alpha-globin locus did not show any deletion that would account for the mildness of her phenotype.

In this study, we used Arabidopsis thaliana to examine the subcellular distribution of CL and CARDIOLIPIN SYNTHASE (CLS) and analyzed loss-of-function cls mutants for defects in mitochondrial morphogenesis and stress response. We show that CL localizes to mitochondria and is enriched at specific domains, and CLS targets to the inner membrane of mitochondria with its C terminus in the intermembrane space. Furthermore, cls mutants exhibit significantly impaired growth as well as altered structural integrity and morphogenesis of mitochondria. In contrast to animals and yeasts, in which CL's effect on mitochondrial fusion is more profound, Arabidopsis CL plays a dominant role in mitochondrial fission and exerts this function, at least in part, through stabilizing the protein complex of the major mitochondrial fission factor, DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3.

This review article discusses recent findings that suggest a novel function of tafazzin in mitochondrial membranes. By shuffling fatty acids between molecular species, tafazzin transforms the lipid composition and by doing so supports changes in the membrane conformation, specifically the generation of membrane curvature.

Our findings suggest that altered BDNF methylation may be a valuable biomarker of PTSD after trauma exposure.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Fracture risk assessment is important for selecting patients who require specific anti-osteoporosis therapy. Post-menopausal osteoporosis is frequently due to an imbalance in bone remodelling, with bone resorption exceeding bone formation. Antiresorptive drugs reduce the number, activity and lifespan of osteoclasts, and include bisphosphonates, oestrogen, selective oestrogen receptor-modulating drugs, strontium ranelate, and the human monoclonal antibody denosumab. Teriparatide is the only anabolic agent currently available that stimulates osteoblast recruitment and activity; its antifracture efficacy for non-vertebral fractures increases with the duration of therapy for up to 2 years when it is associated with persisting increases in bone formation rate at the tissue level. Newer anabolic agents are imminent and include an analogue of parathyroid hormone-related protein, abaloparatide, and a humanised monoclonal antibody to an inhibitor of bone formation, romosozumab. Selection of anti-osteoporosis therapy should be individualised to patients, and the duration of bisphosphonate therapy has been covered in recent guidelines.

Although homozygote patients with these disorders have serious adverse clinical consequences due to excessive bone growth, heterozygote patients have a normal phenotype, high bone mass, and very low risk of fractures.

At 6-month assessment there were moderate to strong correlations of the SF-36 MH scores with HADS depression and anxiety symptoms (r = -0.74 and -0.79) and with IES-R PTSD symptoms (r = -0.60) in the pooled analyses. Using the normalized population mean of 50 on the SF-36 MH domain score as a cut-off, positive predictive values were 16 and 55% for substantial depression; 20 and 68% for substantial anxiety (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and HADS, respectively); and 40, 44, and 67% for substantial PTSD symptoms (IES-R, IES, and Davidson Trauma Scale, respectively). Negative predictive values were high. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the SF-36 MH score was high for depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms (0.88, 0.91, and 0.84, respectively). All results were consistent for the MCS, across the individual studies, and for the 12-month assessment.CONCLUSIONS: For researchers interested in general mental health status, the SF-36 MH or MCS offers a strong measure of psychological symptoms prevalent among survivors of acute respiratory failure. For researchers interested in specific conditions, validated psychological instruments should be considered."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "METHOD: A randomly selected representative sample of inmates in the Puerto Rico correctional system (N = 1,179) was assessed with the Spanish-language Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS); the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) modules for lifetime/current major depression disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and SUD; the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS; posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]); and self-reports of in-site high-risk behaviors.", "answer_start": 248}], "question": "Symptoms of which disorder are evaluated with the Davidson Trauma Scale?", "id": "58861d413b87a8a738000002_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore retrospective childhood ADHD symptomatology, psychiatric comorbidity, rates of substance-use disorders (SUD), as well as their association with high-risk health behaviors in prison and adverse health outcomes.METHOD: A randomly selected representative sample of inmates in the Puerto Rico correctional system (N = 1,179) was assessed with the Spanish-language Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS); the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) modules for lifetime/current major depression disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and SUD; the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS; posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]); and self-reports of in-site high-risk behaviors.RESULTS: Wald χ(2) tests revealed significant associations of ADHD with MDD and PTSD, as well as increased risk for overdosing and intravenous drug use in prison.

The Mis18 complex, and, in particular, its member M18BP1 was shown to be essential for both incorporation and maintenance of CENP-A. Here we show that M18BP1 displays a cell cycle-regulated association with centromeric chromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells. M18BP1 is highly enriched at centromeric regions from late anaphase through to G1 phase. An interaction screen against 16 core centromeric proteins revealed a novel interaction of M18BP1 with CENP-C.

Understanding how CENP-A chromatin is assembled and maintained is central to understanding chromosome segregation mechanisms. CENP-A nucleosome assembly requires the Mis18 complex and the CENP-A chaperone HJURP. These factors localize to centromeres in telophase/G1, when new CENP-A chromatin is assembled. The mechanisms that control their targeting are unknown. In this paper, we identify a mechanism for recruiting the Mis18 complex protein M18BP1 to centromeres. We show that depletion of CENP-C prevents M18BP1 targeting to metaphase centromeres and inhibits CENP-A chromatin assembly.

Whereas S. cerevisiae Scm3 is proposed to replace histone H2A/H2B in centromeric nucleosomes, the dynamic behavior of S. pombe Scm3 suggests that it acts as a Cnp1 assembly/maintenance factor that directly mediates the stable deposition of Cnp1 into centromeric chromatin."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The Mis18 proteins (Mis18α, Mis18β, and M18BP1) are pivotal to the deposition of CENP-A at the centromere during cell cycle progression and are indispensable for embryonic development.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the function of the Mis18 protein?", "id": "58af11e67125859353000001_018", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The Mis18 proteins (Mis18α, Mis18β, and M18BP1) are pivotal to the deposition of CENP-A at the centromere during cell cycle progression and are indispensable for embryonic development.

Mice lacking Mis18α in the epidermis died shortly after birth, showing skin abnormalities like thin and translucent skin and defective skin barrier functions. The epidermis of newborn Mis18α-deficient mice lacked distinct stratification and mature hair follicles, with a reduction in the number of proliferating cells and increased cell death in the basal layer. Earlier expression of the Cre recombinase from keratin-14 promoter in the ventral region resulted in earlier keratinocyte death in the ventral part compared with the dorsal part in the absence of Mis18α, leading to more severe malformation of the ventral epidermal layers. As observed in Mis18α-deficient mouse keratinocytes, knockdown of Mis18α in HaCaT cells caused marked loss of centromeric CENP-A dots and chromosomal misalignment.

Circulating tumor DNA and tumor biopsies were collected at baseline and, following 14 days of treatment, prior to or during surgery. The primary objective was to assess antiproliferative response per Ki67 levels in Arms 2 and 3 compared with Arm 1. Additional assessments included safety, pharmacokinetics, and genetic profiling.RESULTS: Mean decreases in the Ki67-positive cell fraction from baseline were: Arm 1 69% (range 38-100%; n = 2), Arm 2 96% (range 78-100%; n = 6), Arm 3 92% (range 75-100%; n = 3). Decreased phosphorylated Rb levels and CDK4, CDK6, CCND2, CCND3, and CCNE1 gene expression were observed following ribociclib treatment. Ribociclib and letrozole pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with single-agent data. The ribociclib plus letrozole combination was well tolerated, with no Grade 3/4 adverse events over the treatment.CONCLUSION: The results suggest absence of a drug-drug interaction between ribociclib and letrozole and indicate ribociclib plus letrozole may reduce Ki67 expression in HR+, HER2- BC (NCT01919229).Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Preclinical studies identified Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) within polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) as a potential epigenetic anti-tumor target in adult GBM cells but similar inhibition studies in pediatric GBM/DIPG were still missing. Moreover, approximately 30% of pediatric high grade gliomas (pedHGG) including GBM and DIPG harbor a lysine 27 mutation (K27M) in histone 3.3 (H3.3) which is correlated with poor outcome and was shown to influence EZH2 function.PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study investigated the correlation of expression of EZH2 and other PRC2 genes (EZH1, SUZ12, EED) with overall survival of pediatric GBM patients and the cytotoxic impact of EZH2 inhibition by the novel agent Tazemetostat in pediatric GBM/DIPG cells harboring either a H3.3 mutation or a H3 wildtype.RESULTS: EZH2 gene expression does not correlate with survival of pedHGG patients, and EZH2 inhibition does not induce significant cytotoxicity in pedHGG cells independently of H3.3 mutations.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We suggest that EZH2 inhibition might not offer an effective single agent treatment option for paedHGG patients.

Additionally, H3F3A K27M substitutions occur in gliomas that arise at midline locations (eg, pons, thalamus, spine); moreover, this substitution occurs mainly in tumors in children and adolescents. Here, we sought to determine the association between H3F3A mutations and adult thalamic glioma.METHODS: Genomic H3F3A was sequenced from 20 separate thalamic gliomas. Additionally, for 14 of the 20 gliomas, 639 genes--including cancer-related genes and chromatin-modifier genes--were sequenced, and the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip was used to examine DNA methylation across the genome.RESULTS: Of the 20 tumors, 18 were high-grade thalamic gliomas, and of these 18, 11 were from patients under 50 years of age (median age, 38 y; range, 17-46), and 7 were from patients over 50 years of age. The H3F3A K27M mutation was present in 10 of the 11 (91%) younger patients and absent from all 7 older patients. Additionally, H3F3A K27M was not detected in the 2 diffuse astrocytomas. Further sequencing revealed recurrent mutations in TP53, ATRX, NF1, and EGFR. Gliomas with H3F3A K27M from pediatric or young adult patients had similar, characteristic DNA methylation profiles. In contrast, thalamic gliomas with wild-type H3F3A had DNA methylation profiles similar to those of hemispheric glioblastomas.CONCLUSION: We found that high-grade thalamic gliomas from young adults, like those from children and adolescents, frequently had H3F3A K27M."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "K27M-H3.3 is universally associated with short survival in DIPG, while patients wild-type for H3.3 show improved survival.", "answer_start": 1141}], "question": "Which histone mutations have been associated with pediatric gliomas?", "id": "58a6c94860087bc10a00002a_042", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Pediatric glioblastomas (GBM) including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) are devastating brain tumors with no effective therapy.

The long read length enables PacBio sequencing to close gaps in genome assembly, reveal structural variations, and identify gene isoforms with higher accuracy in transcriptomic sequencing. However, PacBio data has high sequencing error rate and most of the errors are insertion or deletion errors. During alignment-based homology search, insertion or deletion errors in genes will cause frameshifts and may only lead to marginal alignment scores and short alignments. As a result, it is hard to distinguish true alignments from random alignments and the ambiguity will incur errors in structural and functional annotation. Existing frameshift correction tools are designed for data with much lower error rate and are not optimized for PacBio data. As an increasing number of groups are using SMRT, there is an urgent need for dedicated homology search tools for PacBio data.RESULTS: In this work, we introduce Frame-Pro, a profile homology search tool for PacBio reads. Our tool corrects sequencing errors and also outputs the profile alignments of the corrected sequences against characterized protein families. We applied our tool to both simulated and real PacBio data. The results showed that our method enables more sensitive homology search, especially for PacBio data sets of low sequencing coverage.

Deletion of several of the residues deemed important for NP binding to NPR-C led to abolition of Ostn binding, confirming the presence of a \"natriuretic motif.\" Functionally, Ostn was able to augment C-type natriuretic peptide-stimulated cGMP production in both pre-chondrocytic (ATDC5) and osteoblastic (UMR106) cells, suggesting increased NP levels due to attenuation of NPR-C associated NP clearance. Ostn-transgenic mice displayed elongated bones and a marked kyphosis associated with elevated bone cGMP levels, suggesting that elevated natriuretic peptide activity contributed to the increased bone length possibly through an increase in growth plate chondrocyte proliferation.

This review presents data on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mirabegron in studies conducted to date.METHODS: All clinical data on mirabegron that are currently in the public domain are included, including some in-press manuscripts.RESULTS: In Phase III clinical trials in patients with overactive bladder (OAB), mirabegron at daily doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg demonstrated significant efficacy in treating the symptoms of OAB, including micturition frequency, urgency incontinence, and urgency. Significant improvements in micturition frequency, urgency incontinence, and mean volume voided/micturition were seen as early as the first assessment (week 4) for mirabegron 50 and 100 mg, and were maintained throughout treatment. Responder analyses showed a significant improvement with mirabegron 50 and 100 mg in terms of dry rates, ≥50% reduction in mean number of incontinence episodes/24 hr, and the proportion of patients with ≤8 micturitions/24 hr at final visit. The benefit of mirabegron 50 and 100 mg was also evident in patients ≥65 years of age, and in both treatment-naïve patients and those who previously discontinued antimuscarinic therapy. These data therefore demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit with mirabegron in the objective endpoints of OAB. Assessment of measures of health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction showed that patients perceived treatment with mirabegron as meaningful. In OAB clinical trials of up to 12 months mirabegron appeared to be well tolerated. The most common adverse events (AEs) observed with mirabegron in clinical trials of up to 12 months were hypertension, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection. The incidence of dry mouth was similar to placebo, and was between three and fivefold less than for tolterodine extended release 4 mg. Since dry mouth is the most bothersome AE associated with antimuscarinic drugs and often a reason for treatment discontinuation, mirabegron may be a valuable treatment option for these patients.CONCLUSIONS: In Phase III clinical trials, mirabegron at daily doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg demonstrated significant efficacy in treating symptoms of OAB and, at doses of 50 and 100 mg, demonstrated significant improvements versus placebo on key secondary endpoints, as early as the first assessment (week 4), and these were maintained throughout treatment.

References of selected articles, data from poster presentations, and abstract publications were additionally reviewed.STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Available English-language data from reviews, abstracts, presentations, and clinical trials of mirabegron in humans were reviewed; relevant clinical data were selected and included.DATA SYNTHESIS: Mirabegron is the newest option for treatment of OAB with symptoms of urge incontinence. As a β3-receptor agonist, it reduces bladder muscle contractions. In two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, mirabegron significantly reduced the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours from baseline (-1.47, -1.63, and -1.13; p < 0.05; and -1.57, -1.46, and -1.17; p < 0.05; all values for mirabegron 50 mg, 100 mg, and placebo). Micturitions per 24 hours were also reduced from baseline (-1.66, -1.75, and -1.05; p < 0.05; and -1.93, -1.77, and -1.34; p < 0.05; all values for mirabegron 50 mg, 100 mg, and placebo). A 12-month trial found mirabegron to have a safety and efficacy profile similar to that of tolterodine.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of OAB initially includes lifestyle and nonpharmacologic intervention; for patients with persistent symptoms despite these treatments, drug therapy represents a next-step approach for symptom control. Mirabegron alleviates symptoms of OAB while having a mechanism of action that provides an alternative for patients who are intolerant of or who have contraindications to anticholinergic agents.

As part of the clinical development program for mirabegron, 2 human volunteer studies were performed to derive detailed data on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of mirabegron.OBJECTIVE: Two randomized Phase I studies were conducted to evaluate the PK properties of mirabegron, including metabolic profile and effects of age and sex, following multiple oral doses in healthy subjects.METHODS: In study 1, mirabegron oral controlled absorption system (OCAS) tablets were administered once daily to healthy young subjects (18-55 years) at doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg and in elderly subjects (65-80 years) at 50 and 200 mg in a double-blind placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. In study 2, mirabegron OCAS was administered once daily to healthy young (18-45 years) and older (≥55 years) subjects at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg in an open-label crossover design. Blood samples were collected up to 72 hours (study 1) and 168 hours (study 2) after the last dose. Urine samples were collected up to 24 hours after the last dose. Plasma and urine concentrations of mirabegron and its metabolites (study 2 only) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. PK parameters were determined using noncompartmental methods. Tolerability assessments included physical examinations, supine blood pressure and pulse rate, orthostatic stress testing (study 1), resting 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), and adverse-events (AE) monitoring using investigators' questionnaires and subjects' spontaneous reports.RESULTS: Thirty-two young male (mean age, 30.3 years; mean weight, 77.1 kg), 32 young female (27.6 years; 64.6 kg), 16 elderly male (69.8 years; 79.3 kg), and 16 elderly female (68.1 years; 67.4 kg) subjects were enrolled in study 1. Eighteen young male (mean age, 28.6 years; mean weight, 68.9 kg), 18 young female (28.7 years; 58.8 kg), 21 older male (63.4 years; 72.6 kg), and 18 older female (65.1 years; 62.3 kg) subjects were enrolled in study 2. Most of the subjects were white (91% in study 1 and 88% in study 2). Mirabegron plasma concentrations peaked at ∼3 to 5 hours and declined multiexponentially with a t of ∼32 hours in study 1 and 60 hours in study 2. Steady state was achieved within 7 days of once daily administration, with an accumulation ratio of ∼2. Mirabegron and its metabolites demonstrated a greater-than-dose-proportional increase in C(max) and AUC(0-τ) after multiple-dose administration. Two major circulating metabolites were observed, representing 17% and 10% of total drug-related AUC(0-τ). Excretion of unchanged mirabegron in urine over the 24-hour dosing interval (Ae(0-τ)%) increased from approximately 7% at 25 mg to 18% at 300 mg once daily in young subjects. Renal clearance (CL(R)) of mirabegron was independent of dose and averaged ∼13 L/h. Mirabegron C(max) and AUC(0-τ) were similar in older and young subjects. Women exhibited ∼40% higher mirabegron C(max) and AUC(0-τ) than men; weight-corrected values were ∼20% higher in women. Mirabegron was generally well tolerated up to 300 mg once daily. No clear trends for increased incidence of AEs occurred with higher doses of mirabegron. The AE with the highest incidence was headache.CONCLUSION: Oral mirabegron exhibited a greater-than-dose-proportional increase in exposure. Sex but not age significantly affected mirabegron exposure.

Candidate trials were assessed for similarity and networks were developed for each outcome. Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using both fixed-effects and random-effects models. When there were differences in mean baseline values between mirabegron and onabotulinumtoxinA trials they were adjusted for using network meta-regression (NMR).RESULTS: No studies directly comparing onabotulinumtoxinA to mirabegron were identified. A network was created for each of the 7 outcomes, with 3-9 studies included in each individual network. The trials included in the networks were broadly similar. Patients in the onabotulinumtoxinA trials had more urinary incontinence and urgency episodes at baseline than patients in the mirabegron trials and these differences were adjusted for using NMR. Both onabotulinumtoxinA and mirabegron were more efficacious than placebo at reducing the frequency of urinary incontinence, urgency, urination and nocturia. OnabotulinumtoxinA was more efficacious than mirabegron (50 and 25 mg) in completely resolving daily episodes of urinary incontinence and urgency and in reducing the frequency of urinary incontinence, urgency and urination. NMR supported the results of the network meta-analysis.CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head trials comparing onabotulinumtoxinA to mirabegron, this indirect comparison indicates that onabotulinumtoxinA may be superior to mirabegron in improving symptoms of urinary incontinence, urgency and urinary frequency in patients with idiopathic OAB.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of β3 -adrenoceptor agonist mirabegron in mouse urethra. The possibility that mirabegron also exerts α1 -adrenoceptor antagonism was also tested in rat smooth muscle preparations presenting α1A - (vas deferens and prostate), α1D - (aorta) and α1B -adrenoceptors (spleen).EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Functional assays were carried out in mouse and rat isolated tissues. Competition assays for the specific binding of [(3) H]prazosin to membrane preparations of HEK-293 cells expressing each of the human α1 -adrenoceptors, as well as β-adrenoceptor mRNA expression and cyclic AMP measurements in mouse urethra, were performed.KEY RESULTS: Mirabegron produced concentration-dependent urethral relaxations that were shifted to the right by the selective β3 -adrenoceptor antagonist L-748,337 but unaffected by β1 - and β2 -adrenoceptor antagonists (atenolol and ICI-118,551 respectively). Mirabegron-induced relaxations were enhanced by the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram, and the agonist stimulated cAMP synthesis. Mirabegron also produced rightward shifts in urethral contractions induced by the α1 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. Schild regression analysis revealed that mirabegron behaves as a competitive antagonist of α1 -adrenoceptors in urethra, vas deferens and prostate (α1A -adrenoceptor, pA2  ≅ 5.6) and aorta (α1D -adrenoceptor, pA2  ≅ 5.4) but not in spleen (α1B -adrenoceptor). The affinities estimated for mirabegron in functional assays were consistent with those estimated in radioligand binding with human recombinant α1A - and α1D -adrenoceptors (pKi  ≅ 6.0).CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The effects of mirabegron in urethral smooth muscle are the result of β3 -adrenoceptor agonism together with α1A and α1D -adrenoceptor antagonism.© 2015 The British Pharmacological Society."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "To examine the effects of mirabegron, a selective β3 -adrenoceptor agonist that has recently been approved for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB", "answer_start": 11}], "question": "What is the indication for Mirabegron?", "id": "58f4b2f070f9fc6f0f000012_025", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of mirabegron, a selective β3 -adrenoceptor agonist that has recently been approved for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB), on erectile function. Stimulation of β3 -adrenoceptors localised in cavernosal smooth muscle cells may play a physiological role in mediating penile erection, and offer a beneficial pharmacological action for patients who have OAB and erectile dysfunction (ED).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Corpus cavernosal (CC) specimens were obtained from patients with ED and Peyronie's disease undergoing penile prosthesis implantation. Erectile responses were also evaluated in vivo after intracavernosal injection (ICI) of mirabegron in anaesthetised rats. Mirabegron-elicited relaxation responses (10(-8) -10(-3) m) on phenylephrine-induced contraction were seen in human CC (HCC) and rat CC strips in isolated organ-bath studies. The effects of inhibitors, namely L-NAME [N(G) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), 100 μm], ODQ [1H-(1,2,4) oxadiazolo(4,3-α) quinoxalin-1-one, a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor, 30μm], methylene blue (a NOS and sGC inhibitor, 20μm), SR59230A (β3 -adrenoceptor blocker, 1 μm), and fasudil [Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, 0.1 μm], on mirabegron-induced relaxation responses were evaluated. Responses to mirabegron were compared with responses to isoprenaline and nebivolol. Immunohistochemistry was used to localise β3 -adrenoceptors and ROCK in CC smooth muscle cells. In vivo rat data were expressed as intracavernosal pressure (ICP)/mean arterial pressure, and total ICP.RESULTS: Mirabegron resulted in a relaxation of phenylephrine-evoked CC contractions in a concentration-dependent manner and SR59230A antagonised the mirabegron-induced relaxations in HCC and rat CC. Other inhibitors, L-NAME, ODQ, and methylene blue, did not affect the mirabegron-induced relaxation responses. Mirabegron relaxation responses at concentrations (0.1-10 μm) were enhanced by fasudil (ROCK inhibitor) in rat but not in HCC strips. KCl-induced contractions in HCC and rat CC were partially inhibited by mirabegron. In vivo, ICI of mirabegron (doses of 0.1-1 mg/kg) had a minor effect on ICP when compared with vehicle administration. Immunohistochemistry data showed β3 -adrenoceptors localised in the smooth muscle cells of the HCC and rat CC.CONCLUSIONS: Mirabegron markedly relaxed isolated CC strips by activating β3 -adrenoceptors independently of the NO-cGMP pathway. There is also evidence of the existence of a close functional link between β3 -adrenoceptors and the RhoA/ROCK pathway. These results may support further clinical studies using combinations of mirabegron with ROCK and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) for the treatment of ED, especially in patients who do not respond to PDE5i therapy.© 2016 The Authors BJU International © 2016 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "mirabegron is a β3-adrenoceptor agonist developed for the treatment of symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB).", "answer_start": 14}], "question": "What is the indication for Mirabegron?", "id": "58f4b2f070f9fc6f0f000012_026", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "INTRODUCTION: mirabegron is a β3-adrenoceptor agonist developed for the treatment of symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB). As the prevalence of OAB increases with age, a prospective subanalysis of individual and pooled efficacy and tolerability data from three 12-week, randomised, Phase III trials, and of tolerability data from a 1-year safety trial were conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of mirabegron in subgroups of patients aged ≥65 and ≥75 years.METHODS: primary efficacy outcomes were change from baseline to final visit in the mean number of incontinence episodes/24 h and the mean number of micturitions/24 h. Tolerability was assessed by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).RESULTS: over 12 weeks mirabegron 25 mg and 50 mg once-daily reduced the mean numbers of incontinence episodes and micturitions/24 h from baseline to final visit in patients aged ≥65 and ≥75 years. Mirabegron was well tolerated: in both age groups, hypertension and urinary tract infection were among the most common TEAEs over 12 weeks and 1 year.

Food effects were assessed in 3 randomized, single-dose studies in young Japanese male subjects (study 1), male and female subjects (study 2), and young Taiwanese male and female subjects (study 3). In the other 2 single- and multiple-dose studies in young Chinese male and female subjects (study 4 and study 5), mirabegron was administered as a single dose under fasted conditions. After the washout period, mirabegron was administered once daily under fed conditions for 8 days. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental methods. Safety and tolerability assessments included physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), and adverse event monitoring.FINDINGS: After administration of single oral doses of mirabegron, exposure under fed conditions was lower than under fasted conditions in Japanese and Taiwanese subjects. In Japanese subjects, a greater reduction in mirabegron Cmax and AUC0-∞ was observed after a low-fat meal compared with a high-fat meal. In Chinese subjects, Cmax was reached at approximately 4.0 hours after single oral doses. Mirabegron accumulated 2- to 3-fold on once-daily dosing of multiple-dose relative to single-dose data. Steady state was reached within 7 days. After administration of mirabegron, mean values for Cmax and AUC in female subjects were higher than those in male subjects. Mirabegron was well tolerated in Japanese, Taiwanese, and Chinese subjects.IMPLICATIONS: Our studies confirm the higher exposure levels of mirabegron in female compared with male East Asian subjects as found earlier in Western subjects. Furthermore, the effects of food on the pharmacokinetic profiles appeared to be similar among the 3 populations tested in our studies. The findings suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences among the Japanese, Taiwanese, and Chinese populations.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Subsequently, the searches were pooled and limited to phase II and III RCTs. Two phase II and five phase III RCTs were selected and analysed. The available phase II studies showed the efficacy and tolerability of different doses of Mirabegron compared with placebo.

The 12-week phase III studies confirmed the effectiveness of Mirabegron to significantly reduce the mean number of incontinence episodes/24 h and the mean number of micturitions/24 h compared with placebo. A post hoc analysis confirmed that favourable results with Mirabegron were reported both in patients with OAB who were antimuscarinic naïve and in those who had discontinued prior antimuscarinic therapy. Moreover, a phase III trial showed the safety and tolerability of 12-month treatment of Mirabegron. Discontinuation due to adverse events was low both using the 50 and 100 mg dose of Mirabegron. Mirabegron is the first of a new class of drugs for the treatment of OAB able to influence non-voiding activity and produce an increased storage capacity and inter-void interval.

We conducted this meta-analysis to systematically examine the efficacy of extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb), a potent antioxidant possessing free radical-scavenging properties, as a treatment for TD in schizophrenia using randomized controlled trial (RCT) data.METHOD: Drawn from English and Chinese databases, 3 RCTs of EGb augmentation of antipsychotics (APs) vs. AP plus placebo or AP monotherapy were identified. 2 evaluators extracted data. The primary outcome measure was the severity of TD symptoms assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Weighted mean difference (WMD) and risk ratio (RR) ±95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager (version 5.1.7.0) and STATA (version 12.0).RESULTS: The 3 RCTs (n=299) from China, of 12 weeks duration, involved schizophrenia patients with TD of 55.9±13.4 years old. EGb (240 mg/day) outperformed the control group in reducing the severity of TD and clinical symptoms as measured by the AIMS (trials=3, n=299, WMD: -2.30 (95%CI: - 3.04, -1.55), P<0.00001) and the adverse drug reactions as assessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) (trials=2, n=142, WMD: -2.38 (95%CI: -4.01, -0.74), P=0.004). Both the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score (trials=2, n=239, P=0.87) and all-cause discontinuation (trials=3, n=299, P=0.21) were similar between the EGb and control group.CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that adjunctive EGb appeared to be an effective and safe option for improving TD in the treatment of schizophrenia patients. However, better RCTs are needed to demonstrate its efficacy and safety especially on cognitive function in TD.TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO: CRD42015024930.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious, often disabling, movement disorder that is caused by medications that block dopamine receptors (i.e., neuroleptics, anti-emetics).

There is currently no standard treatment approach for physicians confronted with such patients. This may be the result of notions that TD is disappearing because of the switch to second-generation antipsychotic agents and that it is largely reversible. In this article we demonstrate that second-generation antipsychotics do, indeed, cause TD and, in fact, the frequency is likely higher than expected because of growing off-label uses and a tripling of prescriptions written in the last 10 years. In addition, studies demonstrate that TD actually remits in only a minority of patients when these drugs are withdrawn. Furthermore, neuroleptic agents are often utilized to treat TD, despite prolonged exposure being a risk factor for irreversibility. The outcome of these trends is a growing population afflicted with TD. We review non-neuroleptic agents that have shown positive results in small, early-phase, blinded trials, including tetrabenazine, amantadine, levetiracetam, piracetam, clonazepam, propranolol, vitamin B6, and Ginkgo biloba. Other options, such as botulinum toxin and deep brain stimulation, will also be discussed, and a suggested treatment algorithm is provided. While these agents are reasonable treatment options at this time there is a need, with a concerted effort between neurology and psychiatry, for full-scale drug development, including multicenter, randomized, blinded trials to confirm the effectiveness of the agents that were positive in phase 2 trials and the development of newer ones."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Antipsychotics may cause tardive dyskinesia in humans and orofacial dyskinesia in rodents.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the cause of Tardive dyskinesia?", "id": "58efa36d70f9fc6f0f000004_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Antipsychotics may cause tardive dyskinesia in humans and orofacial dyskinesia in rodents.

CB1 cannabinoid receptors are highly expressed in the basal ganglia, and a potential role for endocannabinoids in the control of basal ganglia-related movement disorders has been proposed. Therefore, this study investigated whether CB1 receptors are involved in haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia in rats. Adult male rats were treated for four weeks with haloperidol decanoate (38mg/kg, intramuscularly - i.m.). The effect of anandamide (6nmol, intracerebroventricularly - i.c.v.) and/or the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (30μg, i.c.v.) on haloperidol-induced vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) was assessed 28days after the start of the haloperidol treatment. Anandamide reversed haloperidol-induced VCMs; SR141716A (30μg, i.c.v.) did not alter haloperidol-induced VCM per se but prevented the effect of anandamide on VCM in rats.

The use of animal models has been used to further this objective. Here, we review different preparations that have been used to model TD and discuss the contribution of neuroimaging studies conducted in these models. Studies in animal models have lead to several hypotheses of TD pathology, although none has yet emerged as the ultimate underlying cause of this syndrome. We discuss alterations in functional indices, neuron and synapse morphology and changes in specific neurotransmitter systems that have been described in animal models of TD, and outline how these findings have contributed to our understanding of antipsychotic-induced dyskinesias. We conclude that several non-mutually exclusive theories of TD are supported by animal studies, including increases in oxidative stress leading to structural and functional changes in specific neurotransmitter systems.

We reviewed the medical records of patients with TD seen at the Baylor College of Medicine Movement Disorders Clinic between 2002 and 2010 to identify patients with TD associated with aripiprazole. Among 236 patients with TD seen over the specified period, 8 (3.4%) were found to have aripiprazole-associated TD. In 5 patients, TD occurred after exclusive exposure to aripiprazole. The mean age at onset was 55.8 ± 14.8 years with a female predominance. The average duration of treatment with aripiprazole was 18.4 ± 26.4 months. Oro-bucco-lingual stereotypy was seen in all patients. In most patients, TD did not spontaneously improve after stopping aripiprazole. Of the 5 patients treated with tetrabenazine, 4 improved during follow-up. Although aripiprazole, a third generation antipsychotic, has been promoted to have a low risk of TD, the drug accounts for about 3.5% of patients with TD evaluated in a movement disorders clinic.

The authors hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within UCEs are associated with clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).METHODS: Forty-eight SNPs within UCEs were genotyped in 662 patients with stage I through III CRC. The associations between genotypes and recurrence and survival were analyzed in patients with stage II or III CRC who received fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy using a training and validation design. The training set included 115 patients with stage II disease and 170 patients with stage III disease, and the validation set included 88 patients with stage II disease and 112 patients with stage III disease.RESULTS: Eight SNPs were associated with clinical outcomes stratified by disease stage. In particular, for patients with stage II CRC who had at least 1 variant allele of reference SNP sequence 7849 (rs7849), a consistent association with increased recurrence risk was observed in the training set (hazard ratio [HR], 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-5.52), in the replication set (HR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.42-9.64), and in a meta-analysis (HR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.54-5.41).

In those that involved doses of 30 mg twice daily, a significantly greater percentage of patients receiving apremilast (28.8% to 40.9%) compared with placebo (5.3% to 5.8%) achieved at least 75% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score at 16 weeks. Two trials were identified on the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. In the one that involved a dose of 30 mg twice daily, a significantly greater percentage of patients receiving apremilast (38.1%) compared with placebo (19.0%) achieved the American College of Rheumatology criteria for 20% improvement at 16 weeks. In all trials, the drug had an acceptable safety profile, with the most common adverse effects of diarrhea, nausea, and headache.CONCLUSIONS: Apremilast has a novel mechanism of action and is safe and effective for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

The potential for ZIKV transmission through blood transfusion was demonstrated during the ZIKV outbreak that occurred in French Polynesia from October 2013 to April 2014. Pathogen inactivation of blood products is a proactive strategy that provides the potential to reduce transfusion-transmitted diseases. Inactivation of arboviruses by amotosalen and ultraviolet A (UVA) illumination was previously demonstrated for chikungunya, West Nile, and dengue viruses. We report here the efficiency of this process for ZIKV inactivation of human plasma.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma units were spiked with ZIKV. Viral titers and RNA loads were measured in plasma before and after amotosalen and UVA photochemical treatment.RESULTS: The mean ZIKV titers and RNA loads in plasma before inactivation were respectively 6.57 log TCID50 /mL and 10.25 log copies/mL. After inactivation, the mean ZIKV RNA loads was 9.51 log copies/mL, but cell cultures inoculated with inactivated plasma did not result in infected cells and did not produce any replicative virus after one passage, nor detectable viral RNA from the second passage.CONCLUSION: In this study we demonstrate that amotosalen combined with UVA light inactivates ZIKV in fresh-frozen plasma. This inactivation process is of particular interest to prevent plasma transfusion-transmitted ZIKV infections in areas such as French Polynesia, where several arboviruses are cocirculating.© 2015 The Authors Transfusion published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of AABB."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Nine different arboviruses are known to be transmitted by, or associated with, mosquitoes in Europe, and several (West Nile, Sindbis and Tahyna viruses) are reported to cause outbreaks of human disease", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "How are Arboviruses transmitted?", "id": "58f4b85f70f9fc6f0f000015_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Nine different arboviruses are known to be transmitted by, or associated with, mosquitoes in Europe, and several (West Nile, Sindbis and Tahyna viruses) are reported to cause outbreaks of human disease.

Control of vector and pest mosquitoes using chemical pesticides has generated several problems including: insecticide resistance, safety risks for humans and domestic animals, and other environmental concerns. These problems and the high cost and sustainability of programs based predominantly on conventional insecticides have stimulated increased interest in integrated control measures in ricelands. The integrated pest management (IPM) strategy for mosquito control, also known as integrated vector control (IVC), is an ecologically based approach that may involve several complementary interventions used in combination or singly. Environmental management, and chemical, biological and mechanical control, comprise the elements of IVC proposed for use in or near riceland habitats. Some of the elements of environmental management include the use of intermittent irrigation; flushing of fields; use of rice cultivars that require less water; shifting of planting schedules to avoid optimal mosquito breeding conditions; relocation of communities or use of dry belt farming around them; and zooprophylaxis and other personal protection methods, especially use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets. Biological control agents that have been used successfully in rice fields include several species of larvivorous fish, a mermithid nematode (Romanomermis culicivorax), a fungus (Lagenidium giganteum) and bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis and Bacillus sphaericus). The mermithid and the entomopathogens have demonstrated little or no adverse effects on populations of vertebrate and invertebrate nontarget organisms. The successful use of any particular method or combination of interventions for the control of riceland mosquitoes will depend on in-depth ecological studies on the target species and nontarget organisms, sound geographic reconnaissance and effective routine sampling and evaluation. When biological control agents are considered, additional background on the environmental factors limiting their efficacy will also be needed. In addition to the technical components of the various interventions employed in integrated control, sustained suppression of riceland mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit will require a greater sociocultural supportive background, particularly in developing countries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Arboviruses are transmitted by distantly related arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes (class Insecta) and ticks (class Arachnida).", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "How are Arboviruses transmitted?", "id": "58f4b85f70f9fc6f0f000015_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Arboviruses are transmitted by distantly related arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes (class Insecta) and ticks (class Arachnida).

The invertebrate is a blood-sucking arthropod that is competent to transmit the virus between susceptible animals. Arboviruses transmitted by ticks must adapt to the peculiar physiological and behavioral characteristics of ticks, particularly with regard to blood feeding, bloodmeal digestion, and molting. Virus imbibed with the blood meal first infects cells of the midgut wall. During this phase the virus must contend with the heterophagic bloodmeal digestion of ticks (an intracellular process occurring within midgut cells) and overcome the as yet undefined \"gut barrier\" to infection. Genetic and molecular data for a number of tick-borne viruses indicate ways in which such viruses may have adapted to infecting ticks, but far more information is needed. After infection of midgut cells, tick-borne viruses pass to the salivary glands for transmission during the next blood-feeding episode. To do this, the virus must survive molting by establishing an infection in at least one cell type that does not undergo histolysis. Different tick-borne viruses have different strategies for surviving the molting period, targeting a variety of tick tissues. The infection can then persist for the life span of the tick with little evidence of any detrimental effects on the tick. Transmission to a vertebrate host during feeding most probably occurs via saliva that contains virus secreted from infected salivary gland cells. The virus then enters the skin site of feeding, which has been profoundly modified by the pharmacological effects of tick saliva. At least three tick-borne viruses exploit such tick-induced host changes. This phenomenon (saliva-activated transmission) is believed to underlie \"nonviremic transmission,\" whereby a virus is transmitted from an infected to an uninfected cofeeding tick through a host that has an undetectable or very low viremia. Thus tick-borne viruses that have adapted to the feeding characteristics of their tick vectors may not need to induce a virulent infection (with high viremia) in their natural vertebrate hosts. Efficient transmission of tick-borne viruses between cofeeding ticks may be a means of amplifying virus infection prevalence in F1 generations infected by transovarial transmission."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The last decade has seen significant changes in the epidemiology of arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, particularly in relation to the intercontinental spread of Aedes albopictus.", "answer_start": 330}], "question": "How are Arboviruses transmitted?", "id": "58f4b85f70f9fc6f0f000015_016", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Arboviruses - viruses transmitted by haematophagous arthropods - are responsible for febrile syndromes, which sometimes include haemorrhagic or neurological symptoms.

Several biochemical tests with high accuracy have been obtained, but the clinical threshold for request of these tests is not determined clearly.OBJECTIVES: To determine the Likelihood Ratios of clinical symptoms and signs in diagnosing pheochromocytoma. And also meta-analysis of their sensitivity in this disease.DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles dated 1960 to February 2014. Bibliographies were searched to find additional articles.STUDY SELECTION: We included original studies describing the sensitivity and/or likelihood ratios of signs and symptoms in clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma. Their method of diagnosis should have been based on pathology. We excluded specific subtypes or syndromes related to pheochromocytoma, or specific ages or gender. Also we excluded studies before 1993 (JNC5) which no definition of hypertension was presented. 37 articles were chosen finally.DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors reviewed data from articles independently and gave discrepancies to third author for decision. The aim was extraction of raw numbers of patients having defined signs or symptoms, and draw 2 × 2 tables if data available. We meta-analyzed sensitivities by Statsdirect and Likelihood Ratios by Meta-disc soft wares. Because our data was heterogeneous based on I(2) > 50 % (except negative Likelihood ratio of hypertension), we used random effect model for doing meta-analysis. We checked publication bias by drawing Funnel plot for each sign/symptom, and also Egger test.DATA SYNTHESIS: The most prevalent signs and symptoms reported were hypertension (pooled sensitivity of 80.7 %), headache (pooled sensitivity of 60.4 %), palpitation (pooled sensitivity of 59.3 %) and diaphoresis (pooled sensitivity of 52.4 %). The definition of orthostatic hypotension was different among studies. The sensitivity was 23-50 %. Paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing, and weakness were the signs/symptoms which had publication bias based on Funnel plot and Egger test (P value < 0.05). Seven of the articles had control group, and could be used for calculating LR of signs/symptoms. Diaphoresis (LR+ 2.2, LR- 0.45), Palpitation (LR+ 1.9, LR- 0.52) and headache (LR+ 1.6, LR- 0.24) were significant symptoms in clinical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Other signs and symptoms had been reported in only one study and could not have been meta-analyzed. Classic triad of headache, palpitation and diaphoresis in hypertensive patients had the LR+ 6.312 (95 % CI 0.217-183.217) and LR- 0.139 (95 % CI 0.059-0.331). Surprisingly, hypertension was not important in clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma, and even normotension increased the probability of the disease.CONCLUSIONS: By available data, there is no single clinical finding that has significant value in diagnosis or excluding pheochromocytoma. Combination of certain symptoms, signs and para-clinical exams is more valuable for physicians. Further studies should be done, to specify the value of clinical findings. Until that time the process of diagnosis will be based on clinical suspicion and lab tests followed by related imaging."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In the 52 cases analyzed, 40 of the patients had symptoms: 31 patients had hypertension; 10 had the triad of palpitations, diaphoresis, and headaches; and all had elevated urinary metanephrine concentrations.", "answer_start": 723}], "question": "Which are the triad symptoms of pheochromocytoma?", "id": "58da5b588acda34529000015_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the spectrum of imaging appearances of pheochromocytoma and the associated clinical and biochemical features.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, a citywide pathology database (2000-2011) was searched to identify the records of patients with pheochromocytoma. The search yielded the cases of 53 patients (28 men, 25 women; mean age, 50 years). The institutional PACS and radiology information system records, hospital charts, and the provincial electronic health records of these patients were reviewed. Imaging appearances and clinical and biochemical features related to pheochromocytomas were recorded.RESULTS: One chart was not available for review. In the 52 cases analyzed, 40 of the patients had symptoms: 31 patients had hypertension; 10 had the triad of palpitations, diaphoresis, and headaches; and all had elevated urinary metanephrine concentrations. Seven patients had a familial syndrome, and five had bilateral pheochromocytomas. One patient had an extraadrenal pheochromocytoma, and five had malignant tumors. The mean size of pheochromocytomas was 4.0 cm. Most pheochromocytomas were heterogeneous (CT, 56%; MRI, 65%; ultrasound, 45%) and were MIBG positive (90%). Eleven of 34 (32%) pheochromocytomas had T2 signal intensity greater than that of the spleen. Most pheochromocytomas were less enhancing than the spleen (CT, 85%; MRI, 71%). Contrast-enhanced CT was performed on 33 tumors, of which 20 enhanced less than the spleen and 8 showed similar enhancement to the spleen; contrast-enhanced MRI was performed on 24 tumors, of which 12 enhanced less than the spleen and 5 showed similar enhancement to the spleen. Predominant cystic change was found in 4 of 20 (20%) ultrasound, 9 of 41 (22%) CT, and 11 of 34 (32%) MRI examinations. Eight of 34 (24%) pheochromocytomas were hemorrhagic, two (5%) had calcifications, and three of six were PET positive. Two cystic pheochromocytomas and one lipid-containing pheochromocytoma were misdiagnosed as adrenal adenomas.CONCLUSION: Most pheochromocytomas were heterogeneous at imaging, were MIBG positive, accompanied elevated urinary metanephrine concentrations, and were symptomatic. High T2 signal intensity was found in approximately one third of solid tumors.

The hallmark of pheochromocytoma is paroxysmal hypertension associated with diaphoresis, headache, tremulousness, and palpitations. The triad of diaphoresis, tachycardia, and headache in hypertensive patients is highly suggestive of pheochromocytoma. Other symptoms like flushing, nausea, vomiting, personality changes, and visual disturbances may however cast doubt on the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Death resulting from pheochromocytoma is usually due to congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or intracerebral hemorrhage. Although less than 0.1 percent of patients with hypertension have a pheochromocytoma, nearly 50 percent of the mortality with unsuspected pheochromocytoma occurred during anesthesia and surgery or parturition. Patients of unsuspected pheochromocytoma have higher risk for surgery, because some mandatory pre-op medical treatments might have been ignored. It is also a challenge to anesthesiologists to handle unsuspected hypertensive crisis during anesthesia and surgery. We presented such a case of unexpected Pheochromocytoma which was mis-diagnosed by the surgeon and was treated as an ordinary adrenal gland tumor and was scheduled for surgical operation. When the patient was undergoing excision of the tumor, manipulations of the tumor initiated an tremendous elevation of the blood pressure. Upon reviewing her history of normotension with visual disturbance, nausea and restlessness, she was immediate treated as with a pheochromocytoma. Appropriate managements were applied to control her abnormally high fluctuating blood pressure with success and with no complications or adverse effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function (acute heart failure-acute coronary syndrome) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function (chronic heart failure-chronic heart disease) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function (acute kidney injury) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction; and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney.

Since 1973, four proteins, Cdc6/Cdc18, MCM, ORC and Cdt1, have been extensively studied and proved to be pre-RC components. Recently, a novel pre-RC component called Sap1/Girdin was identified. Sap1/Girdin is required for loading Cdc18/Cdc6 to origins for pre-RC assembly in the fission yeast and human cells, respectively. At the transition of G1 to S phase, pre-RC is activated by the two kinases, cyclindependent kinase (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), and subsequently, RPA, primase-polα, PCNA, topoisomerase, Cdc45, polδ, and polɛ are recruited to DNA origins for creating two bi-directional replication forks and initiating DNA replication. As replication forks move along chromatin DNA, they frequently stall due to the presence of a great number of replication barriers on chromatin DNA, such as secondary DNA structures, protein/DNA complexes, DNA lesions, gene transcription. Stalled forks must require checkpoint regulation for their stabilization. Otherwise, stalled forks will collapse, which results in incomplete DNA replication and genomic instability. This short review gives a concise introduction regarding the current understanding of replication initiation and replication fork stabilization."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In eukaryotes, the pre-replication complex is composed of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 and the MCM replicative helicase in conjunction with Cdt1.

To further understand the role of DMP1 in ARHR, we undertook molecular genetic and in vitro expression studies. First, we examined a kindred with a severe hypophosphatemic rickets phenotype and recessive inheritance. Analyses of this family demonstrated that the affected members had elevated serum FGF23 and carried a large, biallelic deletion that removed the majority of DMP1. At a minimum, this deletion encompassed 49 kb between DMP1 exon 3 and an intergenic region 5' to the next telomeric gene, integrin-binding sialoprotein (IBSP). We next performed immunofluorescent studies in cells to understand the effects of the known ARHR mutations on DMP1 cellular processing.

HHRH is distinct from other forms of hypophosphatemic rickets in that affected individuals present with hypercalciuria due to increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and increased intestinal calcium absorption. We performed a genomewide linkage scan combined with homozygosity mapping, using genomic DNA from a large consanguineous Bedouin kindred that included 10 patients who received the diagnosis of HHRH.

Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a homozygous single-nucleotide deletion (c.228delC) in this candidate gene in all individuals affected by HHRH. This mutation is predicted to truncate the NaP(i)-IIc protein in the first membrane-spanning domain and thus likely results in a complete loss of function of this protein in individuals homozygous for c.228delC. In addition, compound heterozygous missense and deletion mutations were found in three additional unrelated HHRH kindreds, which supports the conclusion that this disease is caused by SLC34A3 mutations affecting both alleles. Individuals of the investigated kindreds who were heterozygous for a SLC34A3 mutation frequently showed hypercalciuria, often in association with mild hypophosphatemia and/or elevations in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels.

To further understand the role of DMP1 in ARHR, we undertook molecular genetic and in vitro expression studies. First, we examined a kindred with a severe hypophosphatemic rickets phenotype and recessive inheritance. Analyses of this family demonstrated that the affected members had elevated serum FGF23 and carried a large, biallelic deletion that removed the majority of DMP1. At a minimum, this deletion encompassed 49 kb between DMP1 exon 3 and an intergenic region 5' to the next telomeric gene, integrin-binding sialoprotein (IBSP). We next performed immunofluorescent studies in cells to understand the effects of the known ARHR mutations on DMP1 cellular processing.

HHRH is distinct from other forms of hypophosphatemic rickets in that affected individuals present with hypercalciuria due to increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and increased intestinal calcium absorption. We performed a genomewide linkage scan combined with homozygosity mapping, using genomic DNA from a large consanguineous Bedouin kindred that included 10 patients who received the diagnosis of HHRH. The disease mapped to a 1.6-Mbp region on chromosome 9q34, which contains SLC34A3, the gene encoding the renal sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaP(i)-IIc. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a homozygous single-nucleotide deletion (c.228delC) in this candidate gene in all individuals affected by HHRH. This mutation is predicted to truncate the NaP(i)-IIc protein in the first membrane-spanning domain and thus likely results in a complete loss of function of this protein in individuals homozygous for c.228delC. In addition, compound heterozygous missense and deletion mutations were found in three additional unrelated HHRH kindreds, which supports the conclusion that this disease is caused by SLC34A3 mutations affecting both alleles. Individuals of the investigated kindreds who were heterozygous for a SLC34A3 mutation frequently showed hypercalciuria, often in association with mild hypophosphatemia and/or elevations in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels.

The biochemical basis for hereditary nephrolithiasis and hypercalciuria is unknown, and this has therefore been investigated by a \"positional cloning\" approach. As a first step in this approach, the chromosomal locations of two disorders referred to as Dent's disease and X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis (XRN) were determined. These two disorders, which represent unusual forms of the renal Fanconi syndrome, are characterized by a low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and renal failure. An X-linked inheritance for XRN was established by studies of a North American kindred, and a similar inheritance for Dent's disease was indicated by the observation of a greater disease severity in males and an absence of male-to-male transmission in five British families. X-linked polymorphic genetic markers were used in linkage studies of these families, and the genes causing Dent's disease and XRN were mapped to Xp11. In addition, in one family with Dent's disease, a microdeletion involving the DNA probe M27 beta was identified. This microdeletion was further characterized by using yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) and its size was estimated to be 515 Kb. A search for renal-expressed genes from this region identified a novel gene encoding a chloride channel (CLCN5) with similarities to a family of voltage-gated chloride channels. Molecular genetic studies of CLCN5 demonstrated that mutations, which resulted in a functional loss, were associated with Dent's disease and XRN. In addition, such CLCN5 mutations that would result in a functional loss have also been demonstrated in Japanese children with idiopathic low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, and an Italian kindred with X-linked recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (XLRH) and hypercalciuria.

The Th1 cytokines TNFα and IL-1β induced HIF-1 but not HIF-2 transcription as well as activity, and this effect was additive with hypoxia. In contrast, Th2 cytokines had no effect on HIFs. IL-1β synergised with hypoxia to upregulate EFNA3 and VEGF in a HIF-1-dependent fashion but, despite strongly inducing HIF-1, TNFα suppressed adipokine expression and had minimal effect on EFNA3.

The Th1 cytokines TNFα and IL-1β induced HIF-1 but not HIF-2 transcription as well as activity, and this effect was additive with hypoxia. In contrast, Th2 cytokines had no effect on HIFs. IL-1β synergised with hypoxia to upregulate EFNA3 and VEGF in a HIF-1-dependent fashion but, despite strongly inducing HIF-1, TNFα suppressed adipokine expression and had minimal effect on EFNA3. Supernatants from RA FLS subjected to hypoxia and TNFα induced fewer endothelial tubules than those from FLS subjected to TNFα or hypoxia alone, despite high VEGF protein levels. The Th2 cytokine IL-4 strongly induced ANGPTL-4 and angiogenesis by normoxic FLS and synergised with hypoxia to induce further proangiogenic activity.CONCLUSION: The present work demonstrates that Th1 cytokines in combination with hypoxia are not sufficient to induce angiogenic activity by RA FLS despite HIF-1 activation and VEGF production. In contrast, Th2 cytokines induce angiogenic activity in normoxia and hypoxia, despite their inability to activate HIFs, highlighting the complex relationships between hypoxia, angiogenesis and inflammation in RA."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Multiple folate metabolism-related genes were consistently and significantly altered between the 3 groups in both cohorts.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the cellular pharmacologic impact of MTX on peripheral blood cells, by comparing MTX-treated RA patients to MTX-naive RA patients and healthy controls.METHODS: Gene expression microarray data were used to investigate the expression of 17 folate pathway genes by peripheral blood cells from a cohort of 25 RA patients treated with MTX, 10 MTX-naive RA patients starting treatment with MTX, and 15 healthy controls (test cohort). Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the results in an independent cohort, consisting of 151 RA patients treated with MTX, 28 MTX-naive RA patients starting treatment with MTX, and 24 healthy controls (validation cohort).RESULTS: Multiple folate metabolism-related genes were consistently and significantly altered between the 3 groups in both cohorts.

IL-17A up-regulates expression of numerous inflammation-related genes in target cells such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts, leading to increased production of chemokines, cytokines, antimicrobial peptides and other mediators that contribute to clinical disease features.

Currently, the relationship between pathogenic molecular drivers of disease in RA and therapeutic response is poorly understood.METHODS: We analyzed synovial tissue samples from two RA cohorts of 49 and 20 patients using a combination of global gene expression, histologic and cellular analyses, and analysis of gene expression data from two further publicly available RA cohorts. To identify candidate serum biomarkers that correspond to differential synovial biology and clinical response to targeted therapies, we performed pre-treatment biomarker analysis compared with therapeutic outcome at week 24 in serum samples from 198 patients from the ADACTA (ADalimumab ACTemrA) phase 4 trial of tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) monotherapy versus adalimumab (anti-TNFα) monotherapy.RESULTS: We documented evidence for four major phenotypes of RA synovium - lymphoid, myeloid, low inflammatory, and fibroid - each with distinct underlying gene expression signatures. We observed that baseline synovial myeloid, but not lymphoid, gene signature expression was higher in patients with good compared with poor European league against rheumatism (EULAR) clinical response to anti-TNFα therapy at week 16 (P =0.011). We observed that high baseline serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM1), associated with the myeloid phenotype, and high serum C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13), associated with the lymphoid phenotype, had differential relationships with clinical response to anti-TNFα compared with anti-IL6R treatment. sICAM1-high/CXCL13-low patients showed the highest week 24 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response rate to anti-TNFα treatment as compared with sICAM1-low/CXCL13-high patients (42% versus 13%, respectively, P =0.05) while anti-IL-6R patients showed the opposite relationship with these biomarker subgroups (ACR50 20% versus 69%, P =0.004).CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that underlying molecular and cellular heterogeneity in RA impacts clinical outcome to therapies targeting different biological pathways, with patients with the myeloid phenotype exhibiting the most robust response to anti-TNFα.

Macrophage-derived cytokines fuel the pathological processes in RA and are targets of clinically successful therapies. However, although macrophage polarization determines cytokine production, the polarization state of macrophages in RA joints remains poorly defined. To dissect the molecular basis for the tissue-damaging effects of macrophages in RA joints, we undertook the phenotypic and transcriptomic characterization of ex vivo isolated CD14(+) RA synovial fluid (RA-SF) macrophages. Flow cytometry and gene profiling indicated that RA-SF macrophages express pro-inflammatory polarization markers (MMP12, EGLN3, CCR2), lack expression of markers associated with homeostatic and anti-inflammatory polarization (IGF1, HTR2B) and exhibit a transcriptomic profile that resembles the activin A-dependent gene signature of pro-inflammatory in vitro-generated macrophages. In fact, high levels of Smad-activating activin A were found in RA-SF and, accordingly, the Smad signalling pathway was activated in ex vivo-isolated RA-SF macrophages. In vitro experiments on monocytes and macrophages indicated that RA-SF promoted the acquisition of pro-inflammatory markers (INHBA, MMP12, EGLN3, CCR2) but led to a significant reduction in the expression of genes associated with homeostasis and inflammation resolution (FOLR2, SERPINB2, IGF1, CD36), thus confirming the pro-inflammatory polarization ability of RA-SF. Importantly, the macrophage-polarizing ability of RA-SF was inhibited by an anti-activin A-neutralizing antibody, thus demonstrating that activin A mediates the pro-inflammatory macrophage-polarizing ability of RA-SF. Moreover, and in line with these findings, multicolour immunofluorescence evidenced that macrophages within RA synovial membranes (RA-SM) also express pro-inflammatory polarization markers whose expression is activin A-dependent. Altogether, our results demonstrate that macrophages from RA synovial fluids and membranes exhibit an MMP12(+) EGLN3(+) CCR2(+) pro-inflammatory polarization state whose acquisition is partly dependent on activin A from the synovial fluid."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Gene expression analyses showed a greater prevalence of significantly upregulated genes in HCs with negative ANA values than in those with significant ANA positivity.

However, a subset of such individuals is at risk for development of autoimmune disease. We examined demographic and immunological features that are associated with ANA positivity in clinically healthy persons to develop insights into when this marker carries risk of progression to lupus.METHODS: Biological samples from healthy individuals and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were obtained from the Dallas Regional Autoimmune Disease Registry (DRADR). Measurements carried out on serum samples included ANA, extractable nuclear antibodies (ENA) and autoantibody profiling using an array with more than 100 specificities. Whole blood RNA samples from a subset of individuals were used to analyze gene expression on the Illumina platform. Data were analyzed for associations of high ANA levels with demographic features, the presence of other autoantibodies and with gene expression profiles.RESULTS: Overall, ANA levels are significantly higher in females than in males and this association holds in patients with the autoimmune diseases lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as well as in healthy controls (HC). Age was not significantly associated with ANA levels and the elevated ANA values could not be explained by higher IgG levels. Another autoantibody, anti- cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), did not show gender dimorphism in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or healthy individuals. The autoantigen array showed significant elevations of other autoantibodies in high ANA HCs. Some of these autoantibodies were directed to antigens in skin and others were related to autoimmune conditions of kidney, thyroid or joints. Gene expression analyses showed a greater prevalence of significantly upregulated genes in HCs with negative ANA values than in those with significant ANA positivity. Genes upregulated in high ANA HCs included a celiac disease autoantigen and some components of the Type I interferon (IFN) gene signature.CONCLUSIONS: Risks for ANA positivity include female gender and organ-specific autoimmunity. Upregulation of skin-specific autoantibodies may indicate that early events in the break of tolerance take place in cutaneous structures. Some of these changes may be mediated by Type I IFN.

The patient collective was heterogeneous and negatively selected, i.e. beside of primary treatments, also patients with extensive previous treatment, recurrent tumors or metastases were included. Therapy consisted of radical surgical resection and intraoperative electron radiotherapy using total doses from 15 Gy to 25 Gy relative to the 90% isodose.

Despite multimodal therapies, almost all GBM recur within a narrow margin around the initial resected lesion.

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a pragmatic and effective approach to sterilize the margins from persistent tumor cells, abrogate post-injury proliferative stimuli and to bridge the therapeutic gap between surgery and radiochemotherapy. Therefore, we have set up INTRAGO, a phase I/II dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IORT added to standard therapy in newly diagnosed GBM.

Safety and tolerability (i.e., the maximum tolerated dose, MTD) will be assessed using a classical 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are wound healing deficits or infections requiring surgical intervention, IORT-related cerebral bleeding or ischemia, symptomatic brain necrosis requiring surgical intervention and early termination of external beam radiotherapy (before the envisaged dose of 60 Gy) due to radiotoxicity.

Steroid therapy in systemic diseases and ISD protocols in graft rejection prevention illustrate this problem particularly well.

The spectrum of pathogens giving infectious disease in patients under anti-TNFalpha therapies ranges from common bacteria to more opportunistic organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The infections which were described with TNFalpha inhibitors may have a benign course or may be a serious, life threatening disease, and may be localized or disseminated. These TNFalpha inhibitors related infections were described in the randomized clinical trials, and were then declared to post-marketing surveillance systems and special registries.

This process is suggested for the evolution of an alpha satellite subfamily recently found on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21. The presence of this alpha subfamily may allow pairing between these chromosomes leading to the observed non-random participation of these chromosomes in t(13q14q) and t(14q21q) Robertsonian translocations. The available data also indicate a very similar molecular organisation of the cen-pter region for chromosomes 13 and 21. This latter feature may further allow the two chromosomes to undergo a relatively extensive degree of meiotic pairing (in a manner analogous to that seen in the pseudoautosomal regions of the X and Y chromosomes), thus predisposing these two chromosomes to errors in meiotic segregation and non-disjunction."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The pattern of association of acrocentric chromosomes was examined in ten and five carriers of a 15/21 and a 13/14 Robertsonian translocation, respectively, and was compared with that of the same numbers of relatives with normal karyotypes.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "List the human acrocentric chromosomes that are involved in Robertsonian translocation.", "id": "58da14178acda34529000011_008", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The pattern of association of acrocentric chromosomes was examined in ten and five carriers of a 15/21 and a 13/14 Robertsonian translocation, respectively, and was compared with that of the same numbers of relatives with normal karyotypes.

We identified coilin loss-of-function mutations in a genetic screen for mutants showing either reduced or enhanced expression of an alternatively spliced GFP reporter gene in Arabidopsis thaliana The coilin mutants feature enhanced GFP fluorescence and diminished Cajal bodies compared with wild-type plants. The amount of GFP protein is several-fold higher in the coilin mutants owing to elevated GFP transcript levels and more efficient splicing to produce a translatable GFP mRNA. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing data from two distinct coilin mutants revealed a small, shared subset of differentially expressed genes, many encoding stress-related proteins, and, unexpectedly, a trend toward increased splicing efficiency. These results suggest that coilin attenuates splicing and modulates transcription of a select group of genes.

The two kinases identify a subset of potential peptide targets, all of them result in a consensus sequence composed of at least four basic residues in peptide targets. Linear peptide arrays are therefore a useful approach in the characterization of kinases and substrate identification, which can contribute to delineate the signaling network in which VRK proteins participate. One of these target proteins is coilin; a basic protein located in nuclear Cajal bodies. Coilin is phosphorylated in Ser184 by both VRK1 and VRK2. Coilin colocalizes and interacts with VRK1 in Cajal bodies, but not with the mutant VRK1 (R358X). VRK1 (R358X) is less active than VRK1.

However, a different ranking of symptom severity occurred in the two hosts: the ΔFgOS-2 mutant, that infects wheat spikelets similarly to Δtri5 and ΔFgl1 mutants, provided much reduced symptoms in soybean. Differently from the other mutants, we observed that the ΔFgOS-2 mutant was several fold more sensitive to the glyceollin phytoalexin suggesting that its reduced virulence may be due to its hypersensitivity to this phytoalexin.

Gene therapy approaches may be complementary to pharmacotherapy for several advantages. Gene therapy strategies may target specific chronic pain mechanisms in a tissue-specific manner. The present collection of articles features distinct gene therapy approaches targeting specific mechanisms identified as important in the specific pain conditions. Dr. Fairbanks group describes commonly used gene therapeutics (herpes simplex viral vector (HSV) and adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)), and addresses biodistribution and potential neurotoxicity in pre-clinical models of vector delivery. Dr. Tao group addresses that downregulation of a voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv1.2) contributes to the maintenance of neuropathic pain. Alleviation of chronic pain through restoring Kv1.2 expression in sensory neurons is presented in this review. Drs Goins and Kinchington group describes a strategy to use the replication defective HSV vector to deliver two different gene products (enkephalin and TNF soluble receptor) for the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. Dr. Hao group addresses the observation that the pro-inflammatory cytokines are an important shared mechanism underlying both neuropathic pain and the development of opioid analgesic tolerance and withdrawal. The use of gene therapy strategies to enhance expression of the anti-pro-inflammatory cytokines is summarized. Development of multiple gene therapy strategies may have the benefit of targeting specific pathologies associated with distinct chronic pain conditions (by Guest Editors, Drs. C. Fairbanks and S.

Transcripts encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission predominate as targets of such modifications. Previous reports suggest that RNA editing is responsive to environmental inputs in the form of temperature alterations. However, the molecular determinants underlying temperature-dependent RNA editing responses are not well understood.RESULTS: Using the poikilotherm Drosophila, we show that acute temperature alterations within a normal physiological range result in substantial changes in RNA editing levels. Our examination of particular sites reveals diversity in the patterns with which editing responds to temperature, and these patterns are conserved across five species of Drosophilidae representing over 10 million years of divergence. In addition, we show that expression of the editing enzyme, ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), is dramatically decreased at elevated temperatures, partially, but not fully, explaining some target responses to temperature. Interestingly, this reduction in editing enzyme levels at elevated temperature is only partially reversed by a return to lower temperatures. Lastly, we show that engineered structural variants of the most temperature-sensitive editing site, in a sodium channel transcript, perturb thermal responsiveness in RNA editing profile for a particular RNA structure.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the RNA editing process responds to temperature alterations via two distinct molecular mechanisms: through intrinsic thermo-sensitivity of the RNA structures that direct editing, and due to temperature sensitive expression or stability of the RNA editing enzyme. Environmental cues, in this case temperature, rapidly reprogram the Drosophila transcriptome through RNA editing, presumably resulting in altered proteomic ratios of edited and unedited proteins."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In Drosophila, many messenger RNAs involved in neuro-transmission are re-coded at the RNA level by the RNA-editing enzyme, dADAR, leading to the incorporation of amino acids that are not directly encoded by the genome. dADAR also re-codes its own transcript, but the consequences of this auto-regulation in vivo are unclear", "answer_start": 98}], "question": "Which is the major RNA editing enzyme in Drosophila melanogaster?", "id": "58e9e7aa3e8b6dc87c00000d_008", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Auto-regulatory feedback loops are a common molecular strategy used to optimize protein function.

Site-specific RNA editing events in transcripts encoding ion channel subunits were initially found serendipitously and subsequent directed searches for editing sites and transcriptome sequencing have now led to 972 edited sites being identified in 597 transcripts. Four percent of D. melanogaster transcripts are site-specifically edited and these encode a wide range of largely membrane-associated proteins expressed particularly in CNS.

Hyperglycosylated hCG functions to promote growth of cytotrophoblast cells and invasion by these cells, as occurs in implantation of pregnancy, and growth and invasion by choriocarcinoma cells. hCG free beta-subunit is produced by numerous non-trophoblastic malignancies of different primaries.

Hydroxyurea represents the only available disease-modifying therapy for SCA, and has proven safety and efficacy in high-resource countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is minimal use of hydroxyurea, due to lack of data, absence of evidence-based guidelines, and inexperience among healthcare providers.PROCEDURE: A partnership was established between investigators in North America and sub-Saharan Africa, to develop a prospective multicenter research protocol designed to provide data on the safety, feasibility, and benefits of hydroxyurea for children with SCA.RESULTS: The Realizing Effectiveness Across Continents with Hydroxyurea (REACH, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01966731) trial is a prospective, phase I/II open-label dose escalation study of hydroxyurea that will treat a total of 600 children age 1-10 years with SCA: 150 at each of four different clinical sites within sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and Uganda). The primary study endpoint will be severe hematological toxicities that occur during the fixed-dose treatment phase.

Results of many clinical trials point to hydroxyurea administration for patients with frequent painful crises and acute chest syndrome. Priapism is one of the complications that could be prevented by hydroxyurea, but there are few reports demonstrating the results. Since November 1993, hydroxyurea has been used in our clinic for preventing priapism in patients with stuttering or major attacks who are still capable of achieving intercourse on demand. Five patients were enrolled in the study, and 4 cases benefited by this treatment. After the initial treatment for the acute attack, all five patients developed stuttering priapism. Hydroxyurea was then introduced at the initial dose of 10 mg/kg, and as the hydroxyurea dosage increased, the number or length of priapism episodes decreased. One to two months after the maximal dose (20-35 mg/kg) was introduced, the episodes disappeared. In two patients, we were forced to administer over 30 mg hydroxyurea/kg to abort the episodes, and, in another patient, 25 mg/kg was necessary. All patients present normal sexual activity. Hydroxyurea was discontinued in two patients, but stuttering priapism reappeared. Hydroxyurea was then re-introduced, and priapism disappeared. One patient, using 20 mg hydroxyurea/kg, had a 6-year remission of priapism after hydroxyurea administration; however, he experienced stuttering priapism, 1 month before a major attack, that progressed to impotence. During that month, he did not seek medical attention. In conclusion, the data here presented suggests that hydroxyurea may prevent priapism attacks in sickle cell disease, probably at higher doses than usually prescribed for painful crisis prevention."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Clinical experience with hydroxyurea for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has been accumulating for the past 25 years.

In birds, several cryptochromes occur: Cryptochrome 2, Cryptochrome 4 and two splice products of Cryptochrome 1, Cry1a and Cry1b. With an antibody not distinguishing between the two splice products, Cryptochrome 1 had been detected in the retinal ganglion cells of garden warblers during migration. A recent study located Cry1a in the outer segments of UV/V-cones in the retina of domestic chickens and European robins, another migratory species. Here we report the presence of cryptochrome 1b (eCry1b) in retinal ganglion cells and displaced ganglion cells of European Robins, Erithacus rubecula. Immuno-histochemistry at the light microscopic and electron microscopic level showed eCry1b in the cell plasma, free in the cytosol as well as bound to membranes. This is supported by immuno-blotting. However, this applies only to robins in the migratory state. After the end of the migratory phase, the amount of eCry1b was markedly reduced and hardly detectable. In robins, the amount of eCry1b in the retinal ganglion cells varies with season: it appears to be strongly expressed only during the migratory period when the birds show nocturnal migratory restlessness. Since the avian magnetic compass does not seem to be restricted to the migratory phase, this seasonal variation makes a role of eCry1b in magnetoreception rather unlikely. Rather, it could be involved in physiological processes controlling migratory restlessness and thus enabling birds to perform their nocturnal flights."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Although it has been known for almost half a century that migratory birds can detect the direction of the Earth's magnetic field, the primary sensory mechanism behind this remarkable feat is still unclear.

The results indicate that there were remarkable magnetic materials in the abdomens and not in the head or thorax of the 3(rd)-5(th) instar nymphs, and in macropterous and brachypterous female and male adults of BPH.

Zebrafish has four cry1 genes (cry1aa, cry1ab, cry1ba and cry1bb) homologous to human CRY1 and a single ortholog of human CRY2 as well as 2 cry-like genes (cry4 and cry5). By RT-PCR, magr exhibited a high level of ubiquitous RNA expression in embryos and adult organs, whereas cry genes displayed differential embryonic and adult expression. Importantly, magr depletion did not produce apparent abnormalities in organogenesis. Taken together, magr and cry2 exist as a single copy gene, whereas cry1 exists as multiple gene duplicates in zebrafish.

It was suggested that these corpuscles might represent magnetosomes and function as magnetosensors. Here we determine ferritin low-field paramagnetic susceptibility to estimate its magnetically induced intracellular behaviour. Physical simulations show that ferritin corpuscles cannot be deformed or rotate in weak geomagnetic fields, and thus cannot provide magnetoreception via deformation of the cuticular plate. Furthermore, we reached an alternative hypothesis that ferritin corpuscle in avian ears may function as an intracellular electromagnetic oscillator. Such an oscillator would generate additional cellular electric potential related to normal cell conditions.

We challenge this unambiguity through a unique quantum mechanical molecular dynamics approach where we perform electron transfer dynamics simulations taking into account the motion of the protein upon the electron transfer. This approach allows us to follow the time evolution of the electron transfer in an unbiased fashion and to reveal the molecular driving force that ensures fast electron transfer in cryptochrome guaranteeing formation of a persistent radical pair suitable for magnetoreception.

The diagnosis was delayed because of unilateral weakness, and the symptom was initially misinterpreted as a transient ischemic attack because of no sensory change and pain and normal findings of two brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).RESULTS: Cervical MRI 36 hours after onset revealed acute hematoma from the C3-C5 level; hematoma showed an isointensity on T1-weighted image (WI) with the preservation of epidural fat and a hypointensity on T2WI. A decompressive surgery was scheduled to perform within 2 days after the cervical MRI scan because of a previous anticoagulation therapy, but the patient refused it.

A major breakthrough in understanding the function of the glomerular filter unit has been possible in the last years through both genetic and cell biological studies, which have revealed a crucial role for the visceral epithelial cells of the glomerulus - the podocytes. By now various factors have been found causing podocyte damage, such as toxines, immunological phenomena or systemic disease like diabetes mellitus."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We report a child with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with diuretic-resistant nephrotic edema treated successfully using acute peritoneal dialysis as a means of UF", "answer_start": 318}], "question": "Is edema a symptom of nephrotic syndrome?", "id": "58da270d8acda34529000013_014", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Edema is a cardinal feature of the nephrotic syndrome and sometimes merits independent treatment.

Thus, fluid leaked into the interstitium, depleting the intravascular volume with subsequent activation of renin/aldosterone and consequent avid renal sodium retention. As simple as that! Unfortunately, a number of clinical and laboratory observations have raised serious concerns about the accuracy of this \"underfill\" hypothesis. Instead, an \"overfill\" hypothesis was generated. Under this assumption, the nephrotic syndrome not only leads to urinary protein wasting, but also to primary sodium retention with consequent intravascular overfilling, with the excess fluid spilling into the flood plains of the interstitium, leading to edema. Recently, an attractive mechanism was proposed to explain this primary sodium retention: proteinuria includes plasma proteinases, such as plasmin, which activate the epithelial sodium channel in the collecting duct, ENaC. In this edition, further evidence for this hypothesis is being presented by confirming increased plasmin content in the urine of children with nephrotic syndrome and demonstrating ENaC activation. If correct, this hypothesis would provide a simple treatment for the edema: pharmacological blockade of ENaC, for instance, with amiloride. Yet, how come clinicians have not empirically discovered the presumed power of ENaC blockers in nephrotic syndrome? And why is it that some patients clearly show evidence of intravascular underfilling? The controversy of over- versus underfilling demonstrates how much we still have to learn about the pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The patient was admitted with edema of both legs, and the nephrotic syndrome was discovered, leading to the diagnosis of AA amyloidosis on kidney biopsy.", "answer_start": 212}], "question": "Is edema a symptom of nephrotic syndrome?", "id": "58da270d8acda34529000013_020", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "AA amyloidosis may be a complication of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).

PWS develops hyperphagia, which when left unmanaged, leads to an excessive ingestion of food. To date there is inadequate pharmacological treatment or supplementation for modification of the PWS hyperphagia and/or the associated behaviors. Therefore, the best practice is familial supervision and restriction of diet and environment.AIM: We aimed to determine if the natural supplement of Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) could attenuate hyperphagia or the associated appetite behaviors in children and adolescents with PWS over the 4-week pilot trial period.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover trial over a 10-week period to investigate the effects of CFE on hunger control, in a cohort of children and adolescents with confirmed PWS (n =15, mean age 9.27 ± 3.16 years, body weight 43.98 ± 23.99 kg). Participants from Australia and New Zealand ingested CFE or a placebo of maltodextrin/cabbage leaf over a 4-week period, with a 2-week washout before the crossover to the other treatment. Weekly comparisons in appetite behavior, severity, and drive were recorded by parents, as scaled time-point measures on a hyperphagia questionnaire validated for PWS.RESULTS: CFE administration was found to induce a significant accumulative easing of hyperphagia (P = 0.05), with decreases evident in one-third of the participants. Furthermore due to CFE supplementation, a significant decrease (P ≤ 0.05) was recorded in the category of behavior and a decrease in hyperphagia (n = 8, P = 0.009) was observed at the highest dose 1,000 mg/day (recommended adult dose). There were no reported adverse effects at any dose.CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that an extract of the Indian cactus succulent Caralluma fimbriata eases hyperphagic appetite behavior within a cohort of children and adolescents (n = 15) with PWS without notable adverse effects. The outcomes of this study will have a potential positive impact on PWS management."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In AS, the deletion occurs in the maternally inherited chromosome 15, while in PWS the deletion is found in the paternally inherited chromosome 15", "answer_start": 431}], "question": "Angelman syndrome is associated with deletion of a part of Chromosome 15 but if the deletion occurs in the paternally inherited chromosome 15, what is the disease?", "id": "58e3d9ab3e8b6dc87c000002_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Genetic imprinting has been implicated in the etiology of two clinically distinct but cytogenetically indistinguishable disorders--Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).

Subsequent studies have identified high-frequency mutation of histone H3 to K36M in chondroblastomas and to G34W/L in giant cell tumors of bone, which are diseases of adolescents and young adults. Interestingly, the G34 mutations, the K36M mutations, and the majority of K27M mutations occur in genes encoding the replacement histone H3.3.

Oncogenic activating mutations are now known to occur in a number of epigenetic modifiers (i.e. IDH1/2, EZH2, DNMT3A), pinpointing epigenetic pathways that are involved in tumorigenesis. Similarly, investigations into the role of inactivating mutations in chromatin modifiers (i.e. KDM6A, CREBBP/EP300, SMARCB1) implicate many of these genes as tumor suppressors.

Dietary flavonoids proved to be efficacious in delaying the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. Two such flavonoids, naringin (NAR) and rutin (RUT) were reported to have neuroprotective potential with beneficial effects on spatial and emotional memories in particular. However, the efficacy of these flavonoids is poorly understood on episodic memory, which comprises an important form of autobiographical memory.OBJECTIVE: This study objective is to evaluate NAR and RUT to reverse time-delay-induced long-term and scopolamine-induced short-term episodic memory deficits in Wistar rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have evaluated both short-term and long-term episodic memory forms using novel object recognition task. Open field paradigm was used to assess locomotor activity for any confounding influence on memory assessment. Donepezil was used as positive control and was effective in both models at 1 mg/kg, i.p.RESULTS: Animals treated with NAR and RUT at 50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o. spent significantly more time exploring novel object compared to familiar one, whereas control animals spent almost equal time with both objects in choice trial. NAR and RUT dose-dependently increased recognition and discriminative indices in time-induced long-term as well as scopolamine-induced short-term episodic memory deficit models without interfering with the locomotor activity.CONCLUSION: We conclude that, NAR and RUT averted both short- and long-term episodic memory deficits in Wistar rats, which may be potential interventions for neurodegenerative diseases as well as chemobrain condition.SUMMARY: Incidence of Alzheimer's disease is increasing globally and the current therapy is only symptomatic. Curative treatment is a major lacuna. NAR and RUT are natural flavonoids proven for their pleiotropic pharmacological effects with potential neuroprotective benefits. The study evaluated these flavonoids for their potential to improve the most common form of episodic memory (memory of autobiographical events in relation to time, places etc.) in two differential animal models assessing short-term and long-term memory, respectively. We also found that NAR and RUT were able to reverse both short-term and long-term memory deficits dose dependently in female Wistar rats.

Intrahippocampal transplantation of human neural stem cells resolved all cognitive impairments when animals were tested 1 month after the cessation of chemotherapy.

Stem cell transplantation significantly reduced the number of activated microglia after cyclophosphamide treatment in the brain. Granule and pyramidal cell neurons within the dentate gyrus and CA1 subfields of the hippocampus exhibited significant reductions in dendritic complexity, spine density, and immature and mature spine types following chemotherapy, adverse effects that were eradicated by stem cell transplantation.

As breast cancer survivors now commonly reach late life, it is not known whether previous exposure to chemotherapy may affect long-term risk for cognitive impairment. To help address this concern, this study tested whether successfully surviving chemotherapy earlier in life was associated with later differences in brain metabolic function as an older adult compared to controls. This question was examined using positron emission tomography measures of brain glucose metabolism in elderly women cancer survivors.METHODS: Breast cancer survivors (N = 10), currently free of recurrent cancer and without a diagnosis of a cognitive disorder, were compared to matched healthy controls (N = 10). All subjects were imaged at rest with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Images were analyzed semi-quantitatively using the Alzheimer's Discrimination Tool and a volume of interest-based approach derived from co-registered magnetic resonance imaging.RESULTS: Relative [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (normalized to global) was significantly lower in the survivors compared with control subjects in bilateral orbital frontal regions, consistent with differences between the groups in cognition and executive function (i.e., Trail Making Test, Part B and mini-mental state examination) and despite no significant differences with respect to age, education, intelligence, or working memory. None of the survivors and only one control manifested a global positron emission tomography score consistent with an Alzheimer's disease metabolic pattern.CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy may manifest long-term changes in brain glucose metabolism indicative of subtle frontal hypometabolism, a finding consistent with results from neuropsychological testing and other imaging modalities.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The locations of DAVFs were the transverse-sigmoid sinus in 11, tentorium in 10, cranial vault in 9, and superior sagittal sinus, jugular bulb, foramen magnum, and middle cranial fossa in 1 each.

A role for mTORC1 in the regulation of SREBP1 activity has been suggested; however, the connection between mTORC2 and SREBP1 has not been clearly established and hence is the focus of this study. mTOR kinase inhibitors (for example, INK128), which inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, decreased mSREBP1 levels in various cancer cell lines. Knockdown of rictor, but not raptor, also decreased mSREBP1. Consistently, reduced mSREBP1 levels were detected in cells deficient in rictor or Sin1 compared with parent or rictor-deficient cells with re-expression of ectopic rictor. Hence it is mTORC2 inhibition that causes mSREBP1 reduction. As a result, expression of the mSREBP1 target genes acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty-acid synthase was suppressed, along with suppressed lipogenesis in cells exposed to INK128. Moreover, mSREBP1 stability was reduced in cells treated with INK128 or rictor knockdown. Inhibition of proteasome, GSK3 or the E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBXW7, prevented mSREBP1 reduction induced by mTORC2 inhibition. Thus mTORC2 inhibition clearly facilitates GSK3-dependent, FBXW7-mediated mSREBP1 degradation, leading to mSREBP1 reduction.

The different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival, activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt.

Both rapamycin and novel rapamycin analogues with more favorable pharmaceutical properties, such as CCI-779, RAD 001, and AP23573, are highly specific inhibitors of mTOR. In essence, these agents gain function by binding to the immunophilin FK506 binding protein 12 and the resultant complex inhibits the activity of mTOR. Because mTOR activates both the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70s6k) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1, rapamycin-like compounds block the actions of these downstream signaling elements, which results in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Rapamycin and its analogues also prevent cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activation, inhibit retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, and accelerate the turnover of cyclin D1, leading to a deficiency of active CDK4/cyclin D1 complexes, all of which potentially contribute to the prominent inhibitory effects of rapamycin at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. Rapamycin and rapamycin analogues have demonstrated impressive growth-inhibitory effects against a broad range of human cancers, including breast cancer, in preclinical and early clinical evaluations. In breast cancer cells, PI3K/Akt and mTOR pathways seem to be critical for the proliferative responses mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor, the insulin growth factor receptor, and the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, these pathways may be constitutively activated in cancers with many types of aberrations, including those with loss of PTEN suppressor gene function. Therefore, the development of inhibitors of mTOR and related pathways is a rational therapeutic strategy for breast and other malignancies that possess a wide range of aberrant molecular constituents.

KOS is a rare, possibly underestimated condition, with fewer than 10 cases reported to date. Here we investigate the molecular cause underlying KOS.METHODS: An exome sequencing approach was used on a single affected individual of an Italian consanguineous family coupled with mutation scanning using Sanger sequencing on a second unrelated subject with clinical features fitting the disorder.RESULTS: Exome sequencing was able to identify homozygosity for a novel truncating mutation (c.556C>T, p.Arg186stop) in UBE3B, which encodes a widely expressed HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Homozygosity for a different nonsense lesion affecting the gene (c.1166G>A, p.Trp389stop) was documented in the second affected subject, supporting the recessive mode of inheritance of the disorder. Mutation scanning of the entire UBE3B coding sequence on a selected cohort of subjects with features overlapping, in part, those recurring in KOS did not reveal disease-causing mutations, suggesting phenotypic homogeneity of UBE3B lesions.DISCUSSION: Our data provide evidence that KOS is caused by UBE3B loss of function, and further demonstrate the impact of misregulation of protein ubiquitination on development and growth.

Long term impact of the diagnosis was assessed by questionnaire.RESULTS: We identified 42 children including six with triple A syndrome. The median overall age at diagnosis was 10.8 years and median follow-up 1593 days. Initial Heller myotomy in 17 required further interventions in 11 (65%), while initial treatment with botulinum toxin (n = 20) was ultimately followed by myotomy in 17 (85%).

In this review, we will detail major findings that have advanced our knowledge of Francisella intracellular survival strategies and also attempt to reconcile discrepancies that exist in our molecular understanding of the Francisella-phagocyte interactions."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Francisella tularensis is a highly virulent bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease that is often fatal if untreated.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What organism causes tularemia?", "id": "58f4b9d470f9fc6f0f000016_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Francisella tularensis is a highly virulent bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease that is often fatal if untreated. A live vaccine strain (LVS) of this bacterium is attenuated for virulence in humans but produces lethal disease in mice. F. tularensis has been classified as a Category A agent of bioterrorism. Despite this categorization, little is known about the components of the organism that are responsible for causing disease in its hosts. Here, we report the deletion of a well-characterized lipoprotein of F. tularensis, designated LpnA (also known as Tul4), in the LVS. An LpnA deletion mutant was comparable to the wild-type strain in its ability to grow intracellularly and cause lethal disease in mice. Additionally, mice inoculated with a sublethal dose of the mutant strain were afforded the same protection against a subsequent lethal challenge with the LVS as were mice initially administered a sublethal dose of the wild-type bacterium. The LpnA-deficient strain showed an equivalent ability to promote secretion of chemokines by human monocyte-derived macrophages as its wild-type counterpart. However, recombinant LpnA potently stimulated primary cultures of human macrophages in a Toll-like receptor 2-dependent manner. Although human endothelial cells were also activated by recombinant LpnA, their response was relatively modest. LpnA is clearly unnecessary for multiple functions of the LVS, but its inflammatory capacity implicates it and other Francisella lipoproteins as potentially important to the pathogenesis of tularemia."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Tularemia, caused by the gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis, is a severe, sometimes fatal disease.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What organism causes tularemia?", "id": "58f4b9d470f9fc6f0f000016_010", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Tularemia, caused by the gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis, is a severe, sometimes fatal disease. Interest in tularemia has increased over the last decade due to its history as a biological weapon. In particular, development of novel vaccines directed at protecting against pneumonic tularemia has been an important goal. Previous work has demonstrated that, when delivered at very high inoculums, administration of live, highly attenuated strains of virulent F. tularensis can protect against tularemia. However, lower vaccinating inoculums did not offer similar immunity. One concern of using live vaccines is that the host may develop mild tularemia in response to infection and use of high inoculums may contribute to this issue. Thus, generation of a live vaccine that can efficiently protect against tularemia when delivered in low numbers, e.g. <100 organisms, may address this concern. Herein we describe the ability of three defined, attenuated mutants of F. tularensis SchuS4, deleted for FTT0369c, FTT1676, or FTT0369c and FTT1676, respectively, to engender protective immunity against tularemia when delivered at concentrations of approximately 50 or fewer bacteria. Attenuated strains for use as vaccines were selected by their inability to efficiently replicate in macrophages in vitro and impaired replication and dissemination in vivo. Although all strains were defective for replication in vitro within macrophages, protective efficacy of each attenuated mutant was correlated with their ability to modestly replicate and disseminate in the host. Finally, we demonstrate the parenteral vaccination with these strains offered superior protection against pneumonic tularemia than intranasal vaccination. Together our data provides proof of principle that low dose attenuated vaccines may be a viable goal in development of novel vaccines directed against tularemia."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Tularemia, caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, where F.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What organism causes tularemia?", "id": "58f4b9d470f9fc6f0f000016_011", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Tularemia, caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, where F. tularensis subspecies holarctica has long been the cause of endemic disease in parts of northern Sweden.

Here, we describe the widespread occurrence of a genomic island containing nitrite and nitrate assimilation genes in uncultured Prochlorococcus cells from marine surface waters. These genes are characterized by low GC content, form a separate phylogenetic clade most closely related to marine Synechococcus, and are located in a different genomic region compared with an orthologous cluster found in marine Synechococcus strains. This sequence distinction suggests that these genes were not transferred recently from Synechococcus. We demonstrate that the nitrogen assimilation genes encode functional proteins and are expressed in the ocean. Also, we find that their relative occurrence is higher in the Caribbean Sea and Indian Ocean compared with the Sargasso Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean, which may be related to the nitrogen availability in each region. Our data suggest that the ability to assimilate nitrite and nitrate is associated with microdiverse lineages within high- and low-light (LL) adapted Prochlorococcus ecotypes. It challenges 2 long-held assumptions that (i) Prochlorococcus cannot assimilate nitrate, and (ii) only LL adapted ecotypes can use nitrite.

There is a high need for the development of new treatment regimen. Current studies address novel biologicals or small molecules for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. In particular, interventions in the T-helper 2 cell (Th2) allergic inflammation are promising. Dupilumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interteukin-4R is the first antibody (i.e. 'biological') with published efficacy shown in controlled prospective studies in atopic dermatitis. A number of other target molecules is currently addressed in clinical studies with blocking antibodies against target molecules of Th2 polarized inflammation in atopic dermatitis (e.g. interleukins 13, 22, 31, thymic stromal lymphopoetin). Inhibiting phospodiesterase-4, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule 2, the histamine-4 receptor, or the neurokine-1 receptor may lead to the approval of novel 'small drugs' for a specific treatment of atopic dermatitis. Antifungals may be helpful in the variant of head and neck dermatitis associated with sensitizations against Malassezia species. Induction of specific immune tolerance (e.g. with allergen-specific immunotherapy) should be further studied in terms of the management of atopic dermatitis because available clinical studies resulted in inconsistent results on the skin condition.SUMMARY: Current studies with new substances for the systemic treatment of atopic dermatitis have tremendous implications for the future management of atopic dermatitis."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Best evidence of the clinical efficacy of novel immunologic approaches using biological agents in patients with AD is available for the anti-IL-4 receptor α-chain antibody dupilumab, but a number of studies are currently ongoing with other specific antagonists to immune system players.", "answer_start": 1051}], "question": "Is dupilumab an antibody targeting the IL-1 receptor?", "id": "58df5efbc784871774000001_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex skin disease frequently associated with other diseases of the atopic diathesis. Recent evidence supports the concept that AD can also recognize other comorbidities, such as chronic inflammatory bowel or cardiovascular diseases. These comorbidities might result from chronic cutaneous inflammation or from a common, yet-to-be-defined immunologic background leading to immune deviations. The activation of immune cells and their migration to the skin play an essential role in the pathogenesis of AD. In patients with AD, an underlying immune deviation might result in higher susceptibility of the skin to environmental factors. There is a high unmet medical need to define immunologic endotypes of AD because it has significant implications on upcoming stratification of the phenotype of AD and the resulting targeted therapies in the development of precision medicine. This review article emphasizes studies on environmental factors affecting AD development and novel biological agents used in the treatment of AD. Best evidence of the clinical efficacy of novel immunologic approaches using biological agents in patients with AD is available for the anti-IL-4 receptor α-chain antibody dupilumab, but a number of studies are currently ongoing with other specific antagonists to immune system players. These targeted molecules can be expressed on or drive the cellular players infiltrating the skin (eg, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, or eosinophils). Such approaches can have immunomodulatory and thereby beneficial clinical effects on the overall skin condition, as well as on the underlying immune deviation that might play a role in comorbidities.

Adults with uncontrolled persistent asthma who are receiving medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting β2 agonist require additional treatment options as add-on therapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab as add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma on medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting β2 agonist, irrespective of baseline eosinophil count.METHODS: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, pivotal phase 2b clinical trial at 174 study sites across 16 countries or regions. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with an asthma diagnosis for 12 months or more based on the Global Initiative for Asthma 2009 Guidelines receiving treatment with medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting β2 agonist were eligible for participation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks, or placebo, over a 24-week period. The primary endpoint was change from baseline at week 12 in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 in L) in patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of at least 300 eosinophils per μL assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety outcomes were assessed in all patients that received at least one dose or part of a dose of study drug. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01854047, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-000856-16.FINDINGS: 769 patients (158 in the placebo group and 611 in the dupilumab groups) received at least one dose of study drug. In the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per μL, the greatest increases (200 mg every 2 weeks, p=0·0008; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p=0·0063) in FEV1 compared with placebo were observed at week 12 with doses every 2 weeks in the 300 mg group (mean change 0·39 L [SE 0·05]; mean difference 0·21 [95% CI 0·06-0·36; p=0·0063]) and in the 200 mg group (mean change 0·43 L [SE 0·05]; mean difference 0·26 [0·11-0·40; p=0·0008]) compared with placebo (0·18 L [SE 0·05]). Similar significant increases were observed in the overall population and in the fewer than 300 eosinophils per μL subgroup (overall population: 200 mg every 2 weeks, p<0·0001; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p<0·0001; <300 eosinophils per μL: 200 mg every 2 weeks, p=0·0034; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p=0·0086), and were maintained to week 24. Likewise, dupilumab every 2 weeks produced the greatest reductions in annualised rates of exacerbation in the overall population (70-70·5%), the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per μL (71·2-80·7%), and the subgroup with fewer than 300 eosinophils per μL (59·9-67·6%). The most common adverse events with dupilumab compared with placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (33-41% vs 35%) and injection-site reactions (13-26% vs 13%).INTERPRETATION: Dupilumab increased lung function and reduced severe exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma irrespective of baseline eosinophil count and had a favourable safety profile, and hence in addition to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting β2-agonist therapy could improve the lives of patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma compared with standard therapy alone.FUNDING: Sanofi-Genzyme and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.METHODS: We enrolled patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and a blood eosinophil count of at least 300 cells per microliter or a sputum eosinophil level of at least 3% who used medium-dose to high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids plus long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). We administered dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once weekly. Patients were instructed to discontinue LABAs at week 4 and to taper and discontinue inhaled glucocorticoids during weeks 6 through 9. Patients received the study drug for 12 weeks or until a protocol-defined asthma exacerbation occurred. The primary end point was the occurrence of an asthma exacerbation; secondary end points included a range of measures of asthma control. Effects on various type 2 helper T-cell (Th2)-associated biomarkers and safety and tolerability were also evaluated.RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were assigned to the dupilumab group, and 52 patients were assigned to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Three patients had an asthma exacerbation with dupilumab (6%) versus 23 with placebo (44%), corresponding to an 87% reduction with dupilumab (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.28; P<0.001). Significant improvements were observed for most measures of lung function and asthma control. Dupilumab reduced biomarkers associated with Th2-driven inflammation. Injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and headache occurred more frequently with dupilumab than with placebo.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels who used inhaled glucocorticoids and LABAs, dupilumab therapy, as compared with placebo, was associated with fewer asthma exacerbations when LABAs and inhaled glucocorticoids were withdrawn, with improved lung function and reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers.

Mutations in the PCNA-binding site of CDKN1C significantly increase CDKN1C protein stability and prevent cell cycle progression into the S phase. Overexpression of either wild-type or BWS-mutant CDKN1C inhibited cell proliferation.

However, there is no other report describing clinical findings in patients with molecularly studied IMAGe syndrome. Here, we report clinical and molecular findings in Japanese patients.PATIENTS: We studied a 46,XX patient aged 8·5 years (case 1) and two 46,XY patients aged 16·5 and 15·0 years (cases 2 and 3).RESULTS: Clinical studies revealed not only IMAGe syndrome-compatible phenotypes in cases 1-3, but also hitherto undescribed findings including relative macrocephaly and apparently normal pituitary-gonadal endocrine function in cases 1-3, familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD)-like adrenal phenotype and the history of oligohydramnios in case 2, and arachnodactyly in case 3. Sequence analysis of CDKN1C, pyrosequencing-based methylation analysis of KvDMR1 and high-density oligonucleotide array comparative genome hybridization analysis for chromosome 11p15.5 were performed, showing an identical de novo and maternally inherited CDKN1C gain-of-function mutation (p.Asp274Asn) in cases 1 and 2, respectively, and no demonstrable abnormality in case 3.CONCLUSIONS: The results of cases 1 and 2 with CDKN1C mutation would argue the following: [1] relative macrocephaly is consistent with maternal expression of CDKN1C in most tissues and biparental expression of CDKN1C in the foetal brain; [2] FGD-like phenotype can result from CDKN1C mutation; and [3] genital abnormalities may primarily be ascribed to placental dysfunction.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disease related to 11p15.5 genetic and epigenetic alterations, among them loss-of-function CDKN1C mutations. Intriguing is that CDKN1C gain-of-function variations were recently found in patients with IMAGe syndrome (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and genital anomalies). BWS and IMAGe share an imprinted mode of inheritance; familial analysis demonstrated the presence of the phenotype exclusively when the mutant CDKN1C allele is inherited from the mother. Interestingly, both IMAGe and BWS are characterized by growth disturbances, although with opposite clinical phenotypes; IMAGe patients display growth restriction whereas BWS patients display overgrowth. CDKN1C codifies for CDKN1C/KIP2, a nuclear protein and potent tight-binding inhibitor of several cyclin/Cdk complexes, playing a role in maintenance of the nonproliferative state of cells. The mirror phenotype of BWS and IMAGe can be, at least in part, explained by the effect of mutations on protein functions. All the IMAGe-associated mutations are clustered in the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-binding domain of CDKN1C and cause a dramatic increase in the stability of the protein, which probably results in a functional gain of growth inhibition properties. In contrast, BWS mutations are not clustered within a single domain, are loss-of-function, and promote cell proliferation. CDKN1C is an example of allelic heterogeneity associated with opposite syndromes."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Six of twenty successfully genotyped polymorphisms were nominally associated with EULAR treatment response.

While the function and structure of the Asf1 core are well known, the function of the tail is less well understood. Here, we have explored the role of the yeast (yAsf1) and human (hAsf1a and hAsf1b) Asf1 tails in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show, using a photoreactive, unnatural amino acid, that Asf1 tail residue 210 cross-links to histone H3 in vivo and, further, that loss of C-terminal tail residues 211 to 279 weakens yAsf1-histone binding affinity in vitro nearly 200-fold. Via several yAsf1 C-terminal truncations and yeast-human chimeric proteins, we found that truncations at residue 210 increase transcriptional silencing and that the hAsf1a tail partially substitutes for full-length yAsf1 with respect to silencing but that full-length hAsf1b is a better overall substitute for full-length yAsf1. In addition, we show that the C-terminal tail of Asf1 is phosphorylated at T270 in yeast. Loss of this phosphorylation site does not prevent coimmunoprecipitation of yAsf1 and Rad53 from yeast extracts, whereas amino acid residue substitutions at the Asf1-histone H3/H4 interface do. Finally, we show that residue substitutions in yAsf1 near the CAF-1/HIRA interface also influence yAsf1's function in silencing."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The histone H3-H4 chaperone Asf1 is involved in chromatin assembly (or disassembly), histone exchange, regulation of transcription, and chromatin silencing in several organisms.

One mutant (asf1-33(ts)) was mated with mutants in 77 different kinase genes to identify synthetic lethal combinations. The asf1-33 mutant required the DNA damage checkpoint factors Chk1 and Rad3 for its survival at the restrictive temperature. Chk1, but not Cds1, was phosphorylated in the asf1-33 mutant at the restrictive temperature, indicating that the DNA damage checkpoint was activated in the asf1-33 mutant. DNA damage occured in the asf1-33 mutant, with degradation of the chromosomal DNA observed through pulse-field gel electrophoresis and the formation of Rad22 foci. Sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease in the asf1-33 mutant was increased compared to the asf1(+) strain at the restrictive temperature, suggesting that asf1 mutations also caused a defect in overall chromatin structure. The Asf1-33 mutant protein was mislocalized and incapable of binding histones. Furthermore, histone H3 levels at the centromeric outer repeat region were decreased in the asf1-33 mutant and heterochromatin structure was impaired.

Metagenomic analyses with next-generation sequencing technologies produce enormous numbers of reads from microbial communities, and many reads are derived from microbes whose genomes have not yet been sequenced, limiting the usefulness of existing sequence similarity search tools. Therefore, there is a clear need for a sequence similarity search tool that can rapidly detect weak similarity in large datasets.RESULTS: We developed a tool, which we named CLAST (CUDA implemented large-scale alignment search tool), that enables analyses of millions of reads and thousands of reference genome sequences, and runs on NVIDIA Fermi architecture graphics processing units. CLAST has four main advantages over existing alignment tools. First, CLAST was capable of identifying sequence similarities ~80.8 times faster than BLAST and 9.6 times faster than BLAT. Second, CLAST executes global alignment as the default (local alignment is also an option), enabling CLAST to assign reads to taxonomic and functional groups based on evolutionarily distant nucleotide sequences with high accuracy. Third, CLAST does not need a preprocessed sequence database like Burrows-Wheeler Transform-based tools, and this enables CLAST to incorporate large, frequently updated sequence databases. Fourth, CLAST requires <2 GB of main memory, making it possible to run CLAST on a standard desktop computer or server node.CONCLUSIONS: CLAST achieved very high speed (similar to the Burrows-Wheeler Transform-based Bowtie 2 for long reads) and sensitivity (equal to BLAST, BLAT, and FR-HIT) without the need for extensive database preprocessing or a specialized computing platform.

Our previous work has shown that leptin is important to prevent apoptosis of thymocytes. However, the role of cPLA(2) is still unclear, and the precise mechanism also remains to be elucidated. In this work, we demonstrated that leptin inhibited the LPS-induced toxicity and apoptosis of thymocytes. Western blot and RT-PCR showed that leptin led to a reduction of cPLA(2) activity and mRNA level, as well as caspase-3 cleavage. Moreover, we found that leptin could decrease the activation of p38 MAPK. Accordingly, we pre-treated apoptotic thymocytes with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 and observed an effect similar to the leptin alone treated group. SB203580 also suppressed expression of cPLA(2) and cleavage of caspase-3. Based on these results, we suggest that leptin could attenuate LPS-induced apoptotic injury in mouse thymocyte cells, mainly through the p38/cPLA(2) signalling pathway. The study of the regulatory role of leptin in LPS-induced thymocyte apoptosis can help to explain the role of leptin in the immune system and may provide a novel treatment option in cases of severe trauma, infection, shock, organ failure and autoimmune disease caused by thymic atrophy."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Leptin, the adipocyte-secreted hormone, exerts its main function as regulator of food intake and energy expenditure through central effects at the hypothalamic level.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "From which cell type is leptin secreted?", "id": "58ee0dd5eda5a57672000013_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Leptin, the adipocyte-secreted hormone, exerts its main function as regulator of food intake and energy expenditure through central effects at the hypothalamic level.

To test this possibility in human pituitaries, we examined the expression of leptin and OB-R in normal and neoplastic pituitaries, and the possible functions of leptin in the pituitary were also analyzed. Leptin was present in 20-25% of anterior pituitary cells and was expressed in most normal anterior pituitary cells, including ACTH (70% of ACTH cells), GH (21%), FSH (33%), LH (29%), TSH (32%), and folliculo-stellate cells (64%), but was colocalized with very few PRL cells (3%), as detected by double labeling immunohistochemistry with two different antileptin antibodies.

Light and electron microscopy have shown that adipocytes and gastric epithelial cells contain leptin along their rough endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-granules secretory pathway. Both tissues synthesize a soluble form of the leptin receptor that is secreted bound to leptin in the blood and into the gastric juice. This soluble receptor protect leptin and enhances its half-life. Despite the similarities in the mechanisms of leptin secretion by adipocytes and gastric epithelial cells, they are in fact radically different. In gastric cells leptin follows a rapid regulated secretion pathway whereas adipocytes secrete leptin in a constitutive slow fashion. These differences can be explained by the specific roles play by leptin originating from these two different tissues. Gastric leptin is involved in the short-term regulation of digestion, including delay of gastric emptying, absorption of nutrients by the intestinal wall and secretion of gastric, intestinal and pancreatic hormones.

There was no significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation with lucinactant (geometric least square means: 4.0 days lucinactant vs. 4.5 days placebo; p = .254). In a subset of infants (n = 22), the duration of mechanical ventilation in children with acute lung injury (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fraction of inspired oxygen >200) was significantly shorter with lucinactant (least square means: 2.4 days lucinactant vs. 4.3 days placebo; p = .006).CONCLUSIONS: In mechanically ventilated infants with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, treatment with intratracheal lucinactant appeared to be generally safe.

Although surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) has contributed to lung stability, the effect on lung inflammation is inconclusive. Lucinactant contains sinapultide (KL4), a novel synthetic peptide that functionally mimics surfactant protein B, a protein with anti-inflammatory properties. We tested the hypothesis that lucinactant may modulate lung inflammatory response to mechanical ventilation in the management of RDS and may confer greater protection than animal-derived surfactants.METHODS: Preterm lambs (126.8 ± 0.2 SD d gestation) were randomized to receive lucinactant, poractant alfa, beractant, or no surfactant and studied for 4 h. Gas exchange and pulmonary function were assessed serially. Lung inflammation biomarkers and lung histology were assessed at termination.RESULTS: SRT improved lung compliance relative to no SRT without significant difference between SRT groups. Lucinactant attenuated lung and systemic inflammatory response, supported oxygenation at lower ventilatory requirements, and preserved lung structural integrity to a greater degree than either no SRT or SRT with poractant alfa or beractant.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that early intervention with lucinactant may more effectively mitigate pulmonary pathophysiological sequelae of RDS than the animal-derived surfactants poractant alfa or beractant."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The clinical trials that have been performed, although underpowered, may indicate that lucinactant is superior to phospholipid synthetic surfactant preparations and at least as effective as animal-derived surfactants in reducing morbidity and mortality from RDS.

An RNA fraction highly enriched in CUTs was analysed by a 3' Long-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) approach adapted to deep sequencing. The resulting detailed genomic map of CUTs revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise. Moreover, the transcription of CUTs predominantly arises within nucleosome-free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes. Some of the CUTs start upstream from messenger RNAs and overlap their 5' end. Our study of glycolysis genes, as well as recent results from the literature, indicate that such concurrent transcription is potentially associated with regulatory mechanisms. Our data reveal numerous new CUTs with such a potential regulatory role. However, most of the identified CUTs corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by-products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters. Eukaryotic promoter regions are thus intrinsically bidirectional, a fundamental property that escaped previous analyses because in most cases divergent transcription generates short-lived unstable transcripts present at very low steady-state levels."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, non-coding RNAs, including cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), are subject to degradation by the exosome.

IFN-α alone had little effect on cell viability in vitro. However, the combination of ixazomib with IFN-α significantly enhanced ixazomib's ability to induce apoptotic cell death in BRAF V600E mutant and BRAF wild-type human melanoma tumor cells. The combination of ixazomib and IFN-α also enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma tumor cells; however, this was not seen in BRAF wild-type cells. Ixazomib-induced apoptosis was associated with processing of the pro-apoptotic proteins procaspase-3, -7, -8, and -9, and cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). In an in vivo xenograft model of human melanoma, combination treatment with IFN-α-2b and ixazomib demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor volume when compared to vehicle (p = 0.005) and single therapy ixazomib (p = 0.017) and IFN-α-2b (p = 0.036). These pre-clinical results support further evaluation of combination treatment with ixazomib and IFN-α for the treatment of advanced BRAF V600E mutant melanoma."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Recently it was revealed that the secreted Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin 9 (PCSK9) binds with LDL-receptor (LDL-R) causing its degradation in the lysosome with the result of LDL-C accumulating in the blood.", "answer_start": 532}], "question": "Does PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) binds with HDL-receptor (HDL-R)?", "id": "58db9aa28acda34529000018_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: High level of Low Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C) in circulation in the blood is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke.

Thus, we applied the pharmacological Sirt1 activator SRT3025 in a mouse model of atherosclerosis and in hepatocyte culture.METHODS AND RESULTS: Apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe(-/-)) mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet (1.25% w/w) supplemented with SRT3025 (3.18 g kg(-1) diet) for 12 weeks. In vitro, the drug activated wild-type Sirt1 protein, but not the activation-resistant Sirt1 mutant; in vivo, it increased deacetylation of hepatic p65 and skeletal muscle Foxo1. SRT3025 treatment decreased plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol and reduced atherosclerosis. Drug treatment did not change mRNA expression of hepatic LDL receptor (Ldlr) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9), but increased their protein expression indicating post-translational effects. Consistent with hepatocyte Ldlr and Pcsk9 accumulation, we found reduced plasma levels of Pcsk9 after pharmacological Sirt1 activation. In vitro administration of SRT3025 to cultured AML12 hepatocytes attenuated Pcsk9 secretion and its binding to Ldlr, thereby reducing Pcsk9-mediated Ldlr degradation and increasing Ldlr expression and LDL uptake. Co-administration of exogenous Pcsk9 with SRT3025 blunted these effects. Sirt1 activation with SRT3025 in Ldlr(-/-) mice reduced neither plasma Pcsk9, nor LDL-cholesterol levels, nor atherosclerosis.CONCLUSION: We identify reduction in Pcsk9 secretion as a novel effect of Sirt1 activity and uncover Ldlr as a prerequisite for Sirt1-mediated atheroprotection in mice. Pharmacological activation of Sirt1 appears promising to be tested in patients for its effects on plasma Pcsk9, LDL-cholesterol, and atherosclerosis.© The Author 2014.

The LDL receptor (LDLR) is the primary pathway for LDL-C removal from circulation, and their levels are increased by statins -the main treatment for high blood LDL-C. However, statins have low efficiency because they also increase PCSK9 which targets LDLR for degradation. Since microRNAs have recently emerged as key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis, our aim was to identify potential microRNA-based therapeutics to decrease blood LDL-C and prevent atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS: We over expressed and knocked down miR-27a in HepG2 cells to assess its effect on the expression of key players in the LDLR pathway using PCR Arrays, Elisas, and Western blots. We found that miR-27a decreases LDLR levels by 40% not only through a direct binding to its 3' untranslated region but also indirectly by inducing a 3-fold increase in PCSK9, which enhances LDLR degradation. Interestingly, miR-27a also directly decreases LRP6 and LDLRAP1, two other key players in the LDLR pathway that are required for efficient endocytosis of the LDLR-LDL-C complex in the liver. The inhibition of miR-27a using lock nucleic acids induced a 70% increase in LDLR levels and, therefore, it would be a more efficient treatment for hypercholesterolemia because of its desirable effects not only on LDLR but also on PCSK9.CONCLUSION: The results presented here provide evidence supporting the potential of miR-27a as a novel therapeutic target for the prevention of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We probed the importance of the C-terminus for the degradation of the LDL-R by designing seven de novo mutants of PCSK9 that fill potential druggable cavities. The mutants were tested for their ability to diminish LDL uptake in human HepG2 cells and for affinity towards a calcium independent mutant of the EGF(A) domain of the human LDL-R. The later was done by a newly developed surface plasmon resonance-based assay format. We identified three mutant proteins (G517R, V610R and V644R) with decreased ability to block LDL uptake into HepG2 cells. These mutations define areas outside the direct interaction area between PCSK9 and the LDL-R that could be targeted to inhibit the PCSK9 triggered degradation of the LDL-R.

A detailed lipoprotein profile was determined based on NMR.

Size-exclusion chromatography of human plasma has shown PCSK9 to be partly associated with undefined high molecular weight complexes within the LDL size range. We used density gradient centrifugation to isolate LDL in plasma pooled from 5 normolipidemic subjects and report that >40% of total PCSK9 was associated with LDL.

LDL dose-dependently inhibited binding and degradation of cell surface LDLRs by exogenous PCSK9 in HuH7 cells. LDL also inhibited PCSK9 binding to mutant LDLRs defective at binding LDL.

Elevated LLTs in chemotherapy-exposed patients may result from tumor effects or comorbidities. This study evaluated incidence of Hy's law in chemotherapy-treated cancer patients.METHODS: We identified breast, colorectal, and lung cancer patients diagnosed in 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2007 at a Midwestern health system. Using automated data, potential Hy's law (PHL) cases were defined by patterns of elevated LLTs suggestive of DILI. Among those treated with chemotherapy, we excluded PHL patients with pre-existing conditions that could cause liver injury, producing a cohort meeting Hy's law criteria, according to automated data. Medical record review, conducted among these automated data-derived Hy's law patients, further excluded those with causes of liver injury other than chemotherapy.RESULTS: Using automated data, among chemotherapy-exposed patients (N = 2788), 91 (3.3%) met PHL criteria using LLTs and 64 (2.3%) met Hy's law after excluding underlying liver injury using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes. After a medical record review, 62 of 64 patients qualifying as Hy's law through automated data had other potential causes, leaving two patients (0.07%; 95%CI: 0.01-0.24%) with chemotherapy as a likely alternative cause of liver injury.CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal LLTs are common in chemotherapy-treated patients. Medical record review showed that the incidence of Hy's law events is rare.

Because PDE4 interacts with the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor CD271 in lung fibroblasts, we evaluated the relationship and function of PDE4 and CD271 in normal human skin fibroblasts. All PDE4 isoforms co-immunoprecipitate with CD271 in DM, while apremilast inhibits apoptosis induced by β-amyloid, a CD271 ligand, in DM. Furthermore, apremilast significantly reduces NGF- and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced fibroblast migration, and inhibits DF differentiation into DM mediated by NGF or TGF-β1. Finally, in DM, apremilast significantly reduces cAMP degradation induced by treatment with β-amyloid. Taken together, these results indicate that PDE4 play an important role in psoriasis.

The company's base-case results were therefore not a sufficient basis to inform the most efficient use and position of apremilast. The exploratory ERG analyses indicated that apremilast is more effective (i.e. produces higher health gains) when positioned after TNF-α inhibitor therapies. Furthermore, assumptions made regarding a potential beneficial effect of apremilast on long-term Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression, which cannot be substantiated, have a very significant impact on results. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC), when taking into account their preferred assumptions for HAQ progression for patients on treatment with apremilast, placebo response and monitoring costs for apremilast, concluded that the addition of apremilast resulted in cost savings but also a QALY loss. These cost savings were not high enough to compensate for the clinical effectiveness that would be lost. The AC thus decided that apremilast alone or in combination with DMARD therapy is not recommended for treating adults with active PsA that has not responded to prior DMARD therapy, or where such therapy is not tolerated."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Apremilast is a well-tolerated and effective phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor that is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.", "answer_start": 418}], "question": "Is apremilast effective for psoriatic arthritis?", "id": "5896e22078275d0c4a000014_017", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Chronic plaque psoriasis presents clinically as an inflammatory disease of the skin, which is often associated with comorbidities and responsible for a poor quality of life.

T-brain-1 (TBR1), a critical neuron-specific transcription factor for forebrain development, has been recognized as a high-confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorders. Here, we show that in addition to its role in brain development, Tbr1 responds to neuronal activation and further modulates the Grin2b expression in adult brains and mature neurons. The expression levels of Tbr1 were investigated using both immunostaining and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. We found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of Tbr1 are induced by excitatory synaptic transmission driven by bicuculline or glutamate treatment in cultured mature neurons. The upregulation of Tbr1 expression requires the activation of both α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Furthermore, behavioral training triggers Tbr1 induction in the adult mouse brain. The elevation of Tbr1 expression is associated with Grin2b upregulation in both mature neurons and adult brains. Using Tbr1-deficient neurons, we further demonstrated that TBR1 is required for the induction of Grin2b upon neuronal activation. Taken together with the previous studies showing that TBR1 binds the Grin2b promoter and controls expression of luciferase reporter driven by Grin2b promoter, the evidence suggests that TBR1 directly controls Grin2b expression in mature neurons. We also found that the addition of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) antagonist KN-93, but not the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin antagonist cyclosporin A, to cultured mature neurons noticeably inhibited Tbr1 induction, indicating that neuronal activation upregulates Tbr1 expression in a CaMKII-dependent manner.

All mutants showed a maternal effect, whereby seeds inheriting a maternal mutant allele occasionally aborted later in seed development with defects in embryo patterning, endosperm nuclear size, and cellularization, a phenotype that is variable between subunit mutants. We provide evidence that this maternal effect is due to the necessity of a maternal store of MCM protein in the central cell that is sufficient for maintaining seed viability and size in the absence of de novo MCM transcription.

We found that the distribution of MCM7-S121A is different from wild-type MCM7 and that the MCM7-S121A mutant is much less efficient to form a pre-RC complex with MCM3/MCM5/cdc45 compared with wild-type MCM7. By using the Tet-On inducible HeLa cell line, we revealed that overexpression of wild-type MCM7 but not MCM7-S121A can block S phase entry, suggesting that an excess of the pre-RC complex may activate the cell cycle checkpoint. Further analysis indicates that the Chk1 pathway is activated in MCM7-overexpressed cells in a p53-dependent manner. We performed experiments with the human normal cell line HL-7702 and also observed that overexpression of MCM7 can cause S phase block through checkpoint activation. In addition, we found that MCM7 could also be phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdk1 on Ser-121 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of MCM7-S121A causes an obvious M phase exit delay, which suggests that phosphorylation of MCM7 on Ser-121 in M phase is very important for a proper mitotic exit.

Recent work has revealed that Mcm8 and 9 form a complex that plays a role during homologous recombination in human, chicken and mouse cells. We have therefore re-examined the behavior of the Xenopus homologs of these proteins. We show that Mcm8 and Mcm9 form a dimeric complex in Xenopus egg extract.

MCM-BP accumulates in nuclei in late S phase, well after the loading of MCM2-7 onto chromatin. MCM-BP immunodepletion in Xenopus egg extracts inhibits replication-dependent MCM dissociation without affecting pre-RC formation and DNA replication. When excess MCM-BP is incubated with Xenopus egg extracts or immunopurified MCM2-7, it binds to MCM proteins and promotes disassembly of the MCM2-7 complex. Recombinant MCM-BP also releases MCM2-7 from isolated late-S-phase chromatin, but this activity is abolished when DNA replication is blocked.

Our studies demonstrate that Cdc6, Cdt1 and Mcm2 play a central role in coordinating growth during the proliferation-differentiation switch in somatic self-renewing systems and that Cdc6 expression is rate-limiting for acquisition of replication competence in primary oocytes. In striking contrast, we show that proliferation control during male gametogenesis is not linked to Cdc6 or Mcm2, but appears to be coordinated by the negative regulator Geminin with Cdt1 becoming rate-limiting in late prophase. Our data demonstrate a striking sexual dimorphism in the mechanisms repressing origin licensing and preventing untimely DNA synthesis during meiosis I, implicating a pivotal role for Geminin in maintaining integrity of the male germline genome."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Inspired by the role of the rigid region in promoters, we speculate that the rigid replication origins may facilitate binding of proteins, including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1 and the MCM2-7 complex.", "answer_start": 913}], "question": "What is the role of the MCM2-7 complex?", "id": "58dcd0338acda34529000022_026", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Sequence-dependent DNA flexibility is an important structural property originating from the DNA 3D structure.

Based on analyzing average flexibility profiles of 270 replication origins, we find that yeast replication origins are significantly rigid compared with their surrounding genomic regions. To further understand the highly distinctive property of replication origins, we compare the flexibility patterns between yeast replication origins and promoters, and find that they both contain significantly rigid DNAs.

This Mcm2-mediated regulation of Mcm4/6/7 is independent of Mcm3/5.

It is sometimes possible to store only a summary relevant to particular applications, but generally it is desirable to keep all information needed to revisit experimental results in the future. Thus, the need for efficient lossless compression methods for NGS reads arises. It has been shown that NGS-specific compression schemes can improve results over generic compression methods, such as the Lempel-Ziv algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler transform, or Arithmetic Coding. When a reference genome is available, effective compression can be achieved by first aligning the reads to the reference genome, and then encoding each read using the alignment position combined with the differences in the read relative to the reference. These reference-based methods have been shown to compress better than reference-free schemes, but the alignment step they require demands several hours of CPU time on a typical dataset, whereas reference-free methods can usually compress in minutes.RESULTS: We present a new approach that achieves highly efficient compression by using a reference genome, but completely circumvents the need for alignment, affording a great reduction in the time needed to compress. In contrast to reference-based methods that first align reads to the genome, we hash all reads into Bloom filters to encode, and decode by querying the same Bloom filters using read-length subsequences of the reference genome. Further compression is achieved by using a cascade of such filters.CONCLUSIONS: Our method, called BARCODE, runs an order of magnitude faster than reference-based methods, while compressing an order of magnitude better than reference-free methods, over a broad range of sequencing coverage. In high coverage (50-100 fold), compared to the best tested compressors, BARCODE saves 80-90% of the running time while only increasing space slightly."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In this work, we show how to reduce the memory required by the data structure of Chikhi and Rizk (WABI'12) that represents de Brujin graphs using Bloom filters.", "answer_start": 286}], "question": "In which fields of DNA sequencing are Bloom filters applied?", "id": "58eb6061eda5a57672000005_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: De Brujin graphs are widely used in bioinformatics for processing next-generation sequencing data.

De novo sequence assembly is the problem of combining these reads back to the original genome sequence, without relying on a reference genome. This presents algorithmic and computational challenges, especially for long and repetitive genome sequences. Most existing approaches to the assembly problem operate in the framework of de Bruijn graphs. Yet, a number of recent works use the paradigm of string graph, using a variety of methods for storing and processing suffixes and prefixes, like suffix arrays, the Burrows-Wheeler transform or the FM index. Our work is motivated by a search for new approaches to constructing the string graph, using alternative yet simple data structures and algorithmic concepts.RESULTS: We introduce a novel hash-based method for constructing the string graph. We use incremental hashing, and specifically a modification of the Karp-Rabin fingerprint, and Bloom filters. Using these probabilistic methods might create false-positive and false-negative edges during the algorithm's execution, but these are all detected and corrected. The advantages of the proposed approach over existing methods are its simplicity and the incorporation of established probabilistic techniques in the context of de novo genome sequencing. Our preliminary implementation is favorably comparable with the first string graph construction of Simpson and Durbin (2010) (but not with subsequent improvements). Further research and optimizations will hopefully enable the algorithm to be incorporated, with noticeable performance improvement, in state-of-the-art string graph-based assemblers.© The Author 2014.

Despite longer subsequences unlocking longer genomic features for assembly, associated increase in compute resources limits the practicability of DBG over other assembly archetypes already designed for longer reads. Here, we revisit the DBG paradigm to adapt it to the changing sequencing technology landscape and introduce three data structure designs for spaced seeds in the form of paired subsequences.

Therefore, in addition to lifestyle changes, attenuation of caloric intake and increase in caloric expenditure, pharmacotherapies, including combination medications, may prove beneficial in its treatment. Adding to the current available pharmacotherapies for obesity, the Food and Drug Administration has recently approved 2 new combination medications known as lorcaserin (Belviq) and phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia). As with these and other medications used for weight loss, clinical cautions, side effects, precise review of patients' medical history and selecting the appropriate medication are imperative. Additionally, close follow-up is necessary in patients undergoing treatment for weight loss. As weight loss progresses, patients who are currently undergoing concomitant treatment for comorbid diabetes and hypertension need to be monitored for appropriate changes in medications used to treat those conditions. Weight loss is often accompanied by improvement in blood pressure and glucose levels and therefore resting blood pressure and fasting and/or postprandial plasma glucose levels should be monitored at follow-up. Although unique to each individual, the benefits of weight loss are substantial and can improve well-being and physical health."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "This review of the literature aims to describe previous and current treatment options for oral therapy in locally advanced and metastatic NMSC otherwise unamenable to standard treatment.

We also review the key pieces of primary research undertaken in the past year and how these affect the use of smoothened inhibitors in a clinical setting.RECENT FINDINGS: Medium term follow-up (30 months) of patients treated with vismodegib shows an improvement in response rates for patients with laBCC. The safety profile of vismodegib demonstrated in the original ERIVANCE study has been replicated in a larger patient cohort in a repeat study. Sonidegib is a new smoothened inhibitor currently under investigation for treatment of laBCC, which demonstrates a comparable safety profile to vismodegib. The side-effects of smoothened inhibitors appear related to both dose and duration of treatment. The durability of response to vismodegib is uncertain, but has been observed to last for over a year following discontinuation of treatment.SUMMARY: The understanding of the efficacy and safety of vismodegib has improved since its introduction in 2012. A broadening evidence base supports its use as a valid treatment for laBCC. However, questions remain as to how to integrate its use into existing pathways for treating laBCC and its long-term efficacy."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The recent development of novel hedgehog pathway inhibitors for high-risk BCC (including oral vismodegib and sonidegib) may represent a paradigm shift towards medical management of NMSC.", "answer_start": 881}], "question": "Is sonidegib effective for basal cell carcinoma?", "id": "589a246f78275d0c4a000034_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) comprises basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma, together with a host of rare tumours.

The IE62 possesses several domains essential for trans-activation, including an acidic trans-activation domain (TAD), a serine-rich tract (SRT), and binding domains for USF, TFIIB, and TATA box binding protein (TBP). Transient-transfection assays showed that the VZV IE62 lacking the SRT trans-activated the early VZV ORF61 promoter at only 16% of the level of the full-length IE62. When the SRT of IE62 was replaced with the SRT of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) IEP, its trans-activation activity was completely restored.

Our data show that the serine-rich tract (SRT) of VZV IE62, which is well conserved within the alphaherpesviruses, is needed for trans-activation mediated by the acidic trans-activation domain (TAD). The TADs of IE62, EHV-1 IEP, and HSV-1 VP16 interacted with cellular Mediator 25 in bimolecular complementation assays. The interaction of the IE62 SRT with nucleolar-ribosomal protein EAP resulted in the formation of globular structures within the nucleus. Understanding the mechanisms by which the TAD and SRT of IE62 contribute to the function of this essential regulatory protein is important in understanding the gene program of this human pathogen.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

The proposed mechanisms include tethering the E1B repression domain to p53-responsive promoters via direct E1B-p53 interaction. Cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 by the 55-kDa protein would impose additional inhibition on p53-mediated effects. To investigate further the role of cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in its inhibition by the E1B 55-kDa protein we systematically examined domains in both the Ad12 55-kDa protein and p53 that underpin their colocalization in the cytoplasmic body and show that the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 is essential for retaining p53 in the cytoplasmic body. Deletion of amino acids 11 to 27 or even point mutation L22Q/W23S abolished the localization of p53 to the cytoplasmic body, whereas other parts of TAD and the C-terminal domain of p53 are dispensable. This cytoplasmic body is distinct from aggresome associated with overexpression of some proteins, since it neither altered vimentin intermediate filaments nor associated with centrosome or ubiquitin. Formation of this structure is sensitive to mutation of the Ad12 55-kDa protein. Strikingly, mutation S476/477A near the C terminus of the Ad12 55-kDa protein eliminated the formation of the cytoplasmic body. The equivalent residues in the Ad5 55-kDa protein were shown to be critical for its ability to inhibit p53. Indeed, Ad12 55-kDa mutants that cannot form a cytoplasmic body can no longer inhibit p53-mediated effects. Conversely, the Ad12 55-kDa protein does not suppress p53 mutant L22Q/W23S-mediated apoptosis. Finally, we show that E1B can still sequester p53 that contains the mitochondrial import sequence, thereby potentially preventing the localization of p53 to mitochondria. Thus, cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 by the E1B 55-kDa protein plays an important role in restricting p53 activities."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We have characterized two transcription activation domains (TADs) in Da, called activation domain 1 (AD1) and loop-helix (LH), and have evaluated their roles in promoting peripheral neurogenesis.", "answer_start": 278}], "question": "What is the role of TAD protein domain?", "id": "58dcb47c8acda34529000020_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "E proteins are a special class of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins that heterodimerize with many bHLH activators to regulate developmental decisions, such as myogenesis and neurogenesis.

Autoacetylation of p300/CBP is commonly observed in cell-free HAT assays and has been implicated in the regulation of their HAT activity.

As a molecular class, distinct loci yielding lncRNAs are set to outnumber those yielding mRNAs. However, like many important discoveries, the road leading to uncovering this diverse class of molecules that act through a remarkable repertoire of mechanisms, was not a straight one. The same characteristic that most distinguishes lncRNAs from mRNAs, i.e. their developmental-stage, tissue-, and cell-specific expression, was one of the major impediments to their discovery and recognition as potentially functional regulatory molecules.

The aim of this study was to identify lncRNA expression in articular cartilage and to explore the function of cartilage injury-related lncRNAs (lncRNA-CIR) in OA.METHODS: To identify lncRNAs specifically expressed in OA cartilage, we compared the expression of lncRNAs in OA cartilage with that in normal cartilage using microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses. In OA cartilage, lncRNA-CIR was specifically, differentially, and highly expressed. The function of lncRNA-CIR was determined by silencing and overexpression in vitro. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-related molecules were detected by qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses.RESULTS: Up to 152 lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (>8-fold) in OA and normal cartilage (82 lncRNAs more highly expressed and 70 less highly expressed in OA cartilage than in normal cartilage). A specific differentially expressed lncRNA-CIR was selected according to the results of the higher expression in OA cartilage and OA chondrocytes. The expression of lncRNA-CIR increased in chondrocytes with in vitro treatment with interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α. Silencing of lncRNA-CIR by small interfering RNA promoted the formation of collagen and aggrecan and reduced the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes, such as MMP13 and ADAMTS5. The expression of collagen and aggrecan was reduced, whereas the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes was increased, after overexpression of lncRNA-CIR.CONCLUSION: The results indicate that lncRNA-CIR contributes to ECM degradation and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of OA.

In this study, we show that exosomes derived from cancer cells express ligands for NKG2D and express TGFbeta1, and we investigate the impact of such exosomes on CD8(+) T and NK cell NKG2D expression and on NKG2D-dependent functions. Exosomes produced by various cancer cell lines in vitro, or isolated from pleural effusions of mesothelioma patients triggered down-regulation of surface NKG2D expression by NK cells and CD8(+) T cells. This decrease was rapid, sustained, and resulted from direct interactions between exosomes and NK cells or CD8(+) T cells. Other markers (CD4, CD8, CD56, CD16, CD94, or CD69) remained unchanged, indicating the selectivity and nonactivatory nature of the response. Exosomal NKG2D ligands were partially responsible for this effect, as down-modulation of NKG2D was slightly attenuated in the presence of MICA-specific Ab. In contrast, TGFbeta1-neutralizing Ab strongly abrogated NKG2D down-modulation, suggesting exosomally expressed TGFbeta as the principal mechanism. Lymphocyte effector function was impaired by pretreatment with tumor exosomes, as these cells exhibited poor NKG2D-dependent production of IFN-gamma and poor NKG2D-dependent killing function.

However, application of exosomes in vascular repair and regeneration has rarely been reported. In this study, we tested whether endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-derived exosomes possessed therapeutic effects in rat models of balloon-induced vascular injury by accelerating reendothelialization.METHODS: Exosomes were obtained from the conditioned media of EPCs isolated from human umbilical cord blood. Induction of the endothelial injury was performed in the rats' carotid artery, and the pro-re-endothelialization capacity of EPC-derived exosomes was measured. The in vitro effects of exosomes on the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells were investigated.RESULTS: We found that the EPC-derived exosomes accelerated the re-endothelialization in the early phase after endothelial damage in the rat carotid artery. We also demonstrated that these exosomes enhanced the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in vitro. Moreover, endothelial cells stimulated with these exosomes showed increased expression of angiogenesis-related molecules.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that exosomes are an active component of the paracrine secretion of human EPCs and can promote vascular repair in rat models of balloon injury by up-regulating endothelial cells function.Copyright © 2015.

Macrophage-derived exosomes promote internalization of integrin β1 in primary HUVECs.

Experimental results indicate that macrophage-derived exosomes stimulate trafficking of internalized integrin β1 to lysosomal compartments with a corresponding decrease in the integrin destined for recycling endosomes, resulting in proteolytic degradation of the integrin. Moreover, ubiquitination of HUVEC integrin β1 is enhanced by the exosomes, and exosome-mediated integrin degradation is blocked by bafilomycin A, a lysosomal degradation inhibitor. Macrophage-derived exosomes were also shown to effectively suppress collagen-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway and HUVEC migration, which are both dependent on integrin β1.

The locations and occupancies of a principle component of chromatin, nucleosomes, are typically assayed through use of enzymatic digestion with micrococcal nuclease (MNase). MNase is an endo-exo nuclease that preferentially digests naked DNA and the DNA in linkers between nucleosomes, thus enriching for nucleosome-associated DNA. To determine nucleosome organization genome-wide, DNA remaining from MNase digestion is sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies (MNase-seq). Unfortunately, the results of MNase-seq can vary dramatically due to technical differences and this confounds comparisons between MNase-seq experiments, such as examining condition-dependent chromatin organizations.RESULTS: In this study we use MNase digestion simulations to demonstrate how MNase-seq signals can vary for different nucleosome configuration when experiments are performed with different extents of MNase digestion. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques. The presence of this neighborhood effect ultimately confounds comparisons between different MNase-seq experiments. To address this issue we present a standardized chromatin preparation which controls for technical variance between MNase-based chromatin preparations and enables the collection of similarly sampled (matched) chromatin populations. Standardized preparation of chromatin includes a normalization step for DNA input into MNase digestions and close matching of the extent of digestion between each chromatin preparation using gel densitometry analysis. The protocol also includes directions for successful pairing with multiplex sequencing reactions.CONCLUSIONS: We validated our method by comparing the experiment-to-experiment variation between biological replicates of chromatin preparations from S. cerevisiae. Results from our matched preparation consistently produced MNase-seq datasets that were more closely correlated than other unstandardized approaches. Additionally, we validated the ability of our approach at enabling accurate downstream comparisons of chromatin structures, by comparing the specificity of detecting Tup1-dependent chromatin remodeling events in comparisons between matched and un-matched wild-type and tup1Δ MNase-seq datasets. Our matched MNase-seq datasets demonstrated a significant reduction in non-specific (technical) differences between experiments and were able to maximize the detection of biologically-relevant (Tup1-dependent) changes in chromatin structure."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the resulting fragments.", "answer_start": 260}], "question": "Is there a sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns?", "id": "5a4e1882966455904c00000f_008", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the nucleosome.

We show here that the NEMO C terminus, comprising the ubiquitin binding region and a zinc finger, has a high preference for binding to linear ubiquitin chains. However, immobilization of NEMO, which may be reminiscent of cellular oligomerization, facilitates the interaction with Lys-63 ubiquitin chains. Moreover, selective mutations in NEMO that abolish association with linear ubiquitin but do not affect binding to Lys-63 ubiquitin are only partially compromising NF-κB signaling in response to TNFα stimulation in fibroblasts and T cells. In line with this, TNFα-triggered expression of NF-κB target genes and induction of apoptosis was partially compromised by NEMO mutations that selectively impair the binding to linear ubiquitin chains. Thus, in vivo NEMO interaction with linear and Lys-63 ubiquitin chains is required for optimal IKK activation, suggesting that both type of chains are cooperating in triggering canonical NF-κB signaling."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome.

We examined the effect of sotagliflozin on glycemic control and rate of hypoglycemia measurements in T1D mice maintained on a low daily insulin dose, and compared these results to those from mice maintained in better glycemic control with a higher daily insulin dose alone.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nonobese diabetes-prone mice with cyclophosphamide-induced T1D were randomized to receive one of four daily treatments: 0.2 U insulin/vehicle, 0.05 U insulin/vehicle, 0.05 U insulin/2 mg/kg sotagliflozin or 0.05 U insulin/30 mg/kg sotagliflozin.

Lynch syndrome is a familial cancer syndrome that can be caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of splice site mutations in the MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) gene. To better understand the role of nucleosomes in splicing, we used MLH1 splice site mutations in Lynch syndrome cases as a model to investigate if abnormal splicing was associated with altered nucleosome positioning at exon-intron boundaries.FINDINGS: Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six Lynch syndrome patients. These mutations were previously shown to cause exon skipping in five of the six patients. Allele-specific high-resolution nucleosome mapping across exons and exon-intron boundaries revealed high levels of nucleosomes across all regions examined. Alleles containing donor or acceptor splice site mutations showed no consistent alteration in nucleosome positioning or occupancy.CONCLUSION: Nucleosomes were enriched at MLH1 exons in LCLs derived from Lynch syndrome patients, and in this model system the positioning of nucleosomes was unaltered at exon-intron boundaries containing splice site mutations. Thus, these splice site mutations alone do not significantly change the local organisation of nucleosomes."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "To address this we used Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) to compare the genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy profiles between normal and cancer cell line models of the breast and prostate.", "answer_start": 467}], "question": "What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?", "id": "5a43a139966455904c000008_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning are two key mechanisms that contribute to the epigenetic control of gene expression.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), a major ACH eliminating enzyme, is genetically deficient in 30-50% of Eastern Asians. In alcohol drinkers, ALDH2-deficiency is a well-known risk factor for upper aerodigestive tract cancers, i.e., head and neck cancer and esophageal cancer. However, there is only a limited evidence for stomach cancer. In this study we demonstrated for the first time that ALDH2 deficiency results in markedly increased exposure of the gastric mucosa to acetaldehyde after intragastric administration of alcohol. Our finding provides concrete evidence for a causal relationship between acetaldehyde and gastric carcinogenesis. A plausible explanation is the gastric first pass metabolism of ethanol. The gastric mucosa expresses alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, especially at the high ethanol concentrations prevailing in the stomach after the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The gastric mucosa also possesses the acetaldehyde-eliminating ALDH2 enzyme. Due to decreased mucosal ALDH2 activity, the elimination of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde is decreased, which results in its accumulation in the gastric juice. We also demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment, and L-cysteine cause independent changes in gastric juice and salivary acetaldehyde levels, indicating that intragastric acetaldehyde is locally regulated by gastric mucosal ADH and ALDH2 enzymes, and by oral microbes colonizing an achlorhydric stomach. Markedly elevated acetaldehyde levels were also found at low intragastric ethanol concentrations corresponding to the ethanol levels of many foodstuffs, beverages, and dairy products produced by fermentation. A capsule that slowly releases L-cysteine effectively eliminated acetaldehyde from the gastric juice of PPI-treated ALDH2-active and ALDH2-deficient subjects. These results provide entirely novel perspectives for the prevention of gastric cancer, especially in established risk groups."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "eater in ALDH2(+/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency enhances EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions, barrier dysfunction, and liver damage.", "answer_start": 1932}], "question": "Which are the effects of ALDH2 deficiency?", "id": "5a894f6abc7bade53a000004_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Acetaldehyde, the toxic ethanol (EtOH) metabolite, disrupts intestinal epithelial barrier function.

We evaluated the effect of ALDH2 deficiency on EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions and adherens junctions, gut barrier dysfunction, and liver injury.METHODS: Wild-type and ALDH2-deficient mice were fed EtOH (1 to 6%) in Lieber-DeCarli diet for 4 weeks. Gut permeability in vivo was measured by plasma-to-luminal flux of FITC-inulin, tight junction and adherens junction integrity was analyzed by confocal microscopy, and liver injury was assessed by the analysis of plasma transaminase activity, histopathology, and liver triglyceride.RESULTS: EtOH feeding elevated colonic mucosal acetaldehyde, which was significantly greater in ALDH2-deficient mice. ALDH2(-/-) mice showed a drastic reduction in the EtOH diet intake. Therefore, this study was continued only in wild-type and ALDH2(+/-) mice. EtOH feeding elevated mucosal inulin permeability in distal colon, but not in proximal colon, ileum, or jejunum of wild-type mice. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, EtOH-induced inulin permeability in distal colon was not only higher than that in wild-type mice, but inulin permeability was also elevated in the proximal colon, ileum, and jejunum. Greater inulin permeability in distal colon of ALDH2(+/-) mice was associated with a more severe redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins from the intercellular junctions. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, but not in wild-type mice, EtOH feeding caused a loss of junctional distribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins in the ileum. Histopathology, plasma transaminases, and liver triglyceride analyses showed that EtOH-induced liver damage was significantly greater in ALDH2(+/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency enhances EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions, barrier dysfunction, and liver damage.Copyright © 2015 by the Research Society on Alcoholism."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "This element, which we have named pet (positive effector of transcription), exerts its effect in cis in a position and orientation-dependent manner, suggesting that it may function as part of the nascent pregenome transcript.

Therefore, one approach insurers can use is an age cutoff for covering the cost of topical tretinoin therapy.OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine at what age patients are more likely to receive tretinoin for treatment of acne vulgaris versus other conditions to provide a rational basis for insurers to set coverage cutoffs.METHODS: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data for the years 1990 to 1994 were analyzed to ascertain the age distribution of acne vulgaris office visits and treatment with topical acne agents including tretinoin. These data were compared to office visits and tretinoin treatment of wrinkles, solar elastosis, and other conditions.RESULTS: The mean age (+/- standard deviation) of patients seen for acne vulgaris was 24.3 +/-11.5 years old. The age distribution of topical tretinoin treatment paralleled the age distribution of acne. Tretinoin treatment of acne and of nonacne conditions were equal at an age of 44.CONCLUSION: The distribution of outpatient visits for acne treatment is skewed toward older patients and persists beyond age 40. A rational age cut-off for coverage of topical tretinoin treatment is 40 years."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The efficacy of tretinoin is well established in the treatment of acne and photoaged skin, however as a typical side effect of tretinoin treatment most patients develop a low-grade irritant dermatitis.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Is tretinoin effective for photoaging?", "id": "5a68f2bab750ff4455000017_010", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The efficacy of tretinoin is well established in the treatment of acne and photoaged skin, however as a typical side effect of tretinoin treatment most patients develop a low-grade irritant dermatitis.

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of topical use of tretinoin or isotretinoin on hairless mice epidermis, using appropriate histopathological and histometric techniques, in order to evaluate the influence of isomerism on skin effects. For this, gel cream formulations containing or not 0.05% tretinoin or 0.05% isotretinoin were applied in the dorsum of hairless mice, once a day for seven days. Histopathological evaluation, viable epidermal and horny layer thicknesses as well as the number of epidermal cell layers were determined. Our results showed that tretinoin and isotretinoin were effective in the enhancement of viable epidermis thickness and number of epidermal cell layers, suggesting that they could be used for stimulation of cellular renewal.

Historically, our understanding of GMC specification has arisen from work involving asymmetric localization of intrinsic factors in the NB and GMC. However, recent information on NB lineages has revealed additional intrinsic factors that specify general and specific GMC fates. This review addresses what has been revealed about these intrinsic cues with regard to GMC specification. For example, Prospero, an asymmetrically localized determinant, plays a general role to enable GMC development and to distinguish GMCs from NBs. In contrast, the temporal gene cascade functions within NB lineages to ensure that each GMC in a lineage acquires a different fate. Two different mechanisms used to make the progeny of GMCs different will also be discussed. One is a generic mechanism, regulated by Notch and Numb, that allows sibling cells to adopt different fates.

In the embryonic central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster, secondary precursor cells-ganglion mother cells (GMCs)-divide and produce postmitotic neurons that take on different cell fates. In this study, we show that binary fate decision of two pairs of sibling neurons is accomplished through the interplay of Notch (N) signaling and the intrinsic fate determinant Numb. We show that GMCs have apical-basal polarity and Numb localization and the orientation of division are coordinated to segregate Numb to only one sibling cell. The correct positioning of Numb and the proper orientation of division require Inscuteable (Insc). Loss of insc results in the generation of equivalent sibling cells. Our results provide evidence that sibling neuron fate decision is nonstochastic and normally depends on the presence of Numb in one of the two siblings. Moreover, our data suggest that the fate of some sibling neurons may be regulated by signals that do not require lateral interaction between the sibling cells."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The bipotential Ganglion Mother Cells, or GMCs, in the Drosophila CNS asymmetrically divide to generate two distinct post-mitotic neurons.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the difference between ganglion mother cells (GMC) and intermediate neural precursor cells (INP) in Drosophila?", "id": "59d09a0cbc32f93e6d000001_016", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The bipotential Ganglion Mother Cells, or GMCs, in the Drosophila CNS asymmetrically divide to generate two distinct post-mitotic neurons.

In GMC-1 of the RP2/sib lineage, Slit promotes asymmetric division by down regulating two POU proteins, Nubbin and Mitimere. The down regulation of these proteins allows the asymmetric localization of Inscuteable, leading to the asymmetric division of GMC-1. Consistent with this, over-expression of these POU genes in a late GMC-1 causes mis-localization of Insc and symmetric division of GMC-1 to generate two RP2s. Similarly, increasing the dosage of the two POU genes in sli mutant background enhances the penetrance of the RP2 lineage defects whereas reducing the dosage of the two genes reduces the penetrance of the phenotype.

An organoid growth assay was developed to assess the inhibitory effects of a variety of drugs including endocrine treatments. Organoid cultures were also prepared for histological and immunohistochemical comparison to the tumors of origin.RESULTS: Fifteen endometrial cancer specimens were successfully cultured as PDOs. Small spherical structures formed within 24 hours, and many continued to grow to larger, denser organoids, providing the basis for an organoid growth assay. The STAT3 transcription factor inhibitor, BBI608 (Napabucasin), strongly inhibited growth in almost all PDO cultures, suggesting that stemness programing is involved in organoid formation and/or growth. Inhibition by different growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors was observed in several PDO specimens. Four cultures were inhibited by fulvestrant, implying the importance of estrogen-receptor signaling in some PDO cultures. Organoids closely resembled their tumors of origin in both histomorphology and immunohistochemical expression.CONCLUSIONS: The use of endometrial cancer PDO cultures for development of drug sensitivity testing for individual patient tumors is feasible.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and dementia, is caused by dysregulation of methionine metabolism secondary to deficiency of the allosteric regulator, adenosyl methionine. Deficiency of adenosyl methionine results from increased polyamine biosynthesis by infected host cells, causing increased activity of ornithine decarboxylase, decreased nitric oxide and peroxynitrate formation and impaired immune reactions. The down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation that is observed in aging and dementia is attributed to deficiency of thioretinaco ozonide oxygen complexed with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and phosphate, which catalyzes oxidative phosphorylation. Adenosyl methionine biosynthesis is dependent upon thioretinaco ozonide and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the deficiency of adenosyl methionine and impaired immune function in aging are attributed to depletion of thioretinaco ozonide from mitochondrial membranes. Allyl sulfides and furanonaphthoquinones protect against oxidative stress and apoptosis by increasing the endogenous production of hydrogen sulfide and by inhibiting electron transfer to the active site of oxidative phosphorylation. Diallyl trisulfide and napabucasin inhibit the signaling by the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), potentially enhancing immune function by effects on T helper lymphocytes and promotion of apoptosis. Homocysteine promotes endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis by the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress through activation of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, causing oxidative stress, calcium influx, apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction.

A common feature of most, and possibly all, natural yeast chromosomes is that they have an ARS within 2 kilobases of their physical ends. To study the effects of such telomeric ARSs on chromosome maintenance, we introduced artificial chromosomes of approximately 15 and 60 kilobases into yeast cells and analyzed the requirements for telomeric ARSs and the effects of ARS-free chromosomal arms on the stability of these molecules.

We identified 252 active replication origins in L. kluyveri and found considerable divergence in origin location with S. cerevisiae and with Lachancea waltii. Although some global features of S. cerevisiae replication are conserved: Centromeres replicate early, whereas telomeres replicate late, we found that replication origins both in L. kluyveri and L. waltii do not behave as evolutionary fragile sites. In L. kluyveri, replication timing along chromosomes alternates between regions of early and late activating origins, except for the 1 Mb GC-rich chromosomal arm. This chromosomal arm contains an origin consensus motif different from other chromosomes and is replicated early during S-phase. We showed that precocious replication results from the specific absence of late firing origins in this chromosomal arm. In addition, we found a correlation between GC-content and distance from replication origins as well as a lack of replication-associated compositional skew between leading and lagging strands specifically in this GC-rich chromosomal arm.

In this review, we summarize the structure and basic synaptic function of neurexins and neuroligins, followed by behaviors and synaptic phenotypes of knock-in and knock-out mouse of these family genes. From the studies of these mice, it turns out that the effects of neurexins and neuroligins are amazingly neural circuit dependent, even within the same brain region.

Surprisingly, germline knockout of neuroligin-3 did not alter synaptic transmission, whereas the neuroligin-3 R451C and R704C knockins decreased and increased, respectively, synaptic transmission. These puzzling results prompted us to ask whether neuroligin-3 mutant phenotypes may be reshaped by developmental plasticity. Indeed, conditional knockout of neuroligin-3 during late development produced a marked synaptic phenotype, whereas conditional knockout of neuroligin-3 during early development caused no detectable effect, mimicking the germline knockout. In canvassing potentially redundant candidate genes, we identified developmentally early expression of another synaptic neurexin ligand, cerebellin-1. Strikingly, developmentally early conditional knockout of cerebellin-1 only modestly impaired synaptic transmission, whereas in contrast to the individual single knockouts, developmentally early conditional double knockout of both cerebellin-1 and neuroligin-3 severely decreased synaptic transmission. Our data suggest an unanticipated mechanism of developmental compensation whereby cerebellin-1 and neuroligin-3 functionally occlude each other during development of calyx synapses.

The CA10-neurexin complex is stable and stoichiometric, and results in formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between conserved cysteine residues in neurexins and CA10. CA10 promotes surface expression of α- and β-neurexins, suggesting that CA10 may form a complex with neurexins in the secretory pathway that facilitates surface transport of neurexins.

The presence of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in their postsynaptic density (PSD) distinguishes perisomatic synapses from GABAergic synapses on dendrites and the axon-initial segment. Targeted deletion of neuroligin 2 (NL2), a transmembrane protein interacting with presynaptic neurexin, has been reported to disrupt postsynaptic clustering of GABAA receptors (GABAAR) and their anchoring protein, gephyrin, at perisomatic synapses. In contrast, targeted deletion of Gabra2 disrupts perisomatic clustering of gephyrin, but not of α1-GABAAR, NL2, or dystrophin/dystroglycan. Unexpectedly, conditional deletion of Dag1, encoding dystroglycan, selectively prevents the formation of perisomatic GABAergic synapses from basket cells expressing cholecystokinin. Collectively, these observations suggest that multiple mechanisms regulate formation and molecular composition of the GABAergic PSD at perisomatic synapses. Here, we further explored this issue by investigating the effect of targeted deletion of Gabra1 and NL2 on the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and on perisomatic synapse formation, using immunofluorescence analysis with a battery of GABAergic pre- and postsynaptic markers. We show that the absence of α1-GABAAR increases GABAergic synapses containing the α2 subunit, without affecting the clustering of dystrophin and NL2; in contrast, the absence of NL2 produces highly variable effects postsynaptically, not restricted to perisomatic synapses and being more severe for the GABAAR subunits and gephyrin than dystrophin.

The base-pairing interactions involved in the formation of the d(GGA)n and d(GGGA)n hairpins are different. G.A pairs importantly contribute to the stability of the d(GGA)n hairpins. On the other hand, the d(GGGA)n hairpins are stabilized by the formation of G.G and A.A, but not G.A pairs. Homopurine d(G1-3A)n tracts are frequently found at genomic locations performing specialized chromosomal functions (i.e. telomeres, centromeres, and recombination \"hot-spots\"). The molecular interactions described here are relevant for the understanding of the peculiar structural and biological properties of DNA sequences containing homopurine tracts."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Introducing a new method to visualize large stretches of genomic DNA (see Appendix S1) the article reports that most GA-sequences [1] shared chains of tetra-GA-motifs and contained upstream poly(A)-segments.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Which are the properties of mammalian GA-sequences?", "id": "5a43a581966455904c00000a_012", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Introducing a new method to visualize large stretches of genomic DNA (see Appendix S1) the article reports that most GA-sequences [1] shared chains of tetra-GA-motifs and contained upstream poly(A)-segments.

Their specific combinations of tetra-GA motifs are assumed to be present in the particular GA-sequence whose associated loop contains the gene for the target protein. As long as the target protein is abundant in the cell it produces sufficient numbers of such oligomers which bind to their specific GA-sequences and, thereby, inhibit locally the transcription of the target protein in the associated loop. However, if the amount of target protein drops below a certain threshold, the resultant reduction of specific oligomers leaves the corresponding GA-sequence 'denuded'.

Of the six esters synthesized, the smaller esters (e.g. methyl and ethyl) were more effective enzyme inhibitors (IC50 approximately 11 and 20 microg/mL, respectively).

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the bona-fide regulatory ncRNAs are destabilized by the Xrn1 5'-3' RNA exonuclease (also known as Kem1), but the genome-wide characterization of the entire regulatory ncRNA family remains elusive. Here, using strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we identify a novel class of 1,658 Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts (XUTs) in which 66% are antisense to open reading frames. These transcripts are polyadenylated and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent. The majority of XUTs strongly accumulate in lithium-containing media, indicating that they might have a role in adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions. Notably, RNAPII chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of Xrn1-deficient strains revealed a significant decrease of RNAPII occupancy over 273 genes with antisense XUTs. These genes show an unusual bias for H3K4me3 marks and require the Set1 histone H3 lysine 4 methyl-transferase for silencing. Furthermore, abolishing H3K4me3 triggers the silencing of other genes with antisense XUTs, supporting a model in which H3K4me3 antagonizes antisense ncRNA repressive activity.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the induction of the entire DosR regulon is triggered as a synchronous event or if induction can unfold as a cascade of events as the differential expression of subsets of genes is stimulated by different oxygen availabilities.RESULTS: A novel aspect of our work is the use of chemostat cultures of M. tuberculosis which allowed us to control environmental conditions very tightly. We exposed M. tuberculosis to a sudden drop in oxygen availability in chemostat culture and studied the transcriptional response of the organism during the transition from a high oxygen level (10% dissolved oxygen tension or DOT) to a low oxygen level (0.2% DOT) using DNA microarrays. We developed a Bayesian change point analysis method that enabled us to detect subtle shifts in the timing of gene induction. It results in probabilities of a change in gene expression at certain time points. A computational analysis of potential binding sites upstream of the DosR-controlled genes shows how the transcriptional responses of these genes are influenced by the affinity of these binding sites to DosR. Our study also indicates that a subgroup of DosR-controlled genes is regulated indirectly.CONCLUSION: The majority of the dosR-dependent genes were up-regulated at 0.2% DOT, which confirms previous findings that these genes are triggered by hypoxic environments. However, our change point analysis also highlights genes which were up-regulated earlier at levels of about 8% DOT indicating that they respond to small fluctuations in oxygen availability.

Interestingly, patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may suffer disease onset or progression as a result of alterations in the DNA methylation of clock genes as well as prolonged pharmacological treatment for these disorders that may lead to impairment of circadian rhythm function. Tumorigenesis also can occur with the loss of a maintained circadian rhythm and lead to an increased risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, breast cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer.

Here we perform genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and RNA-seq to obtain comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) maps of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome and to dissect X chromosome dosage compensation, which balances gene expression between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. The dosage compensation complex (DCC), a condensin complex, binds to both hermaphrodite X chromosomes via sequence-specific recruitment elements on X (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half. Most DCC condensin subunits also act in other condensin complexes to control the compaction and resolution of all mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. By comparing chromosome structure in wild-type and DCC-defective embryos, we show that the DCC remodels hermaphrodite X chromosomes into a sex-specific spatial conformation distinct from autosomes. Dosage-compensated X chromosomes consist of self-interacting domains (∼1 Mb) resembling mammalian topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs on X chromosomes have stronger boundaries and more regular spacing than on autosomes. Many TAD boundaries on X chromosomes coincide with the highest-affinity rex sites and become diminished or lost in DCC-defective mutants, thereby converting the topology of X to a conformation resembling autosomes. rex sites engage in DCC-dependent long-range interactions, with the most frequent interactions occurring between rex sites at DCC-dependent TAD boundaries. These results imply that the DCC reshapes the topology of X chromosomes by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing weak boundaries through interactions between its highest-affinity binding sites. As this model predicts, deletion of an endogenous rex site at a DCC-dependent TAD boundary using CRISPR/Cas9 greatly diminished the boundary.

A recently discovered DNA-activated type I IFN pathway, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), has been linked to Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and mouse models of lupus. The aim of this study was to determine whether the cGAS pathway contributes to type I IFN production in patients with SLE.METHODS: SLE disease activity was measured by the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index. Expression of messenger RNA for cGAS and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) levels were examined by multiple reaction monitoring with ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.RESULTS: Expression of cGAS in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly higher in SLE patients than in normal controls (n = 51 and n = 20 respectively; P < 0.01). There was a positive correlation between cGAS expression and the IFN score (P < 0.001). The expression of cGAS in PBMCs showed a dose response to type I IFN stimulation in vitro, consistent with it being an ISG. Targeted measurement of cGAMP by tandem mass spectrometry detected cGAMP in 15% of the SLE patients (7 of 48) but none of the normal (0 of 19) or rheumatoid arthritis (0 of 22) controls. Disease activity was higher in SLE patients with cGAMP versus those without cGAMP.CONCLUSION: Increased cGAS expression and cGAMP in a proportion of SLE patients indicates that the cGAS pathway should be considered as a contributor to type I IFN production. Whereas higher cGAS expression may be a consequence of exposure to type I IFN, detection of cGAMP in patients with increased disease activity indicates potential involvement of this pathway in disease expression.© 2016, American College of Rheumatology."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Inappropriate upregulation of type I IFN signaling and interferon-stimulated gene expression have been linked to several CNS diseases termed \"interferonopathies\" including Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 (USP18)-deficiency.", "answer_start": 924}], "question": "List the four most important interferonopathies", "id": "5a882b5761bb38fb24000013_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Type I interferons (IFNs), IFN-α and IFN-β, represent the major effector cytokines of the host immune response against viruses and other intracellular pathogens.

Moreover, cell-type-specific replication timing of TADs partitions the genome into two large-scale sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and accounting for the reduced correlation of replication timing to LADs and heterochromatin. Our results reconcile cell-type-specific sub-nuclear compartmentalization and replication timing with developmentally stable structural domains and offer a unified model for large-scale chromosome structure and function."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The genome of metazoan cells is organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) that have similar histone modifications, transcription level, and DNA replication timing.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "How are topologically associating domains (TAD) associated with replication timing?", "id": "58ee217feda5a57672000015_013", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The genome of metazoan cells is organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) that have similar histone modifications, transcription level, and DNA replication timing. Although similar structures appear to be conserved in fission yeast, computational modeling and analysis of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data have been used to argue that the small, highly constrained budding yeast chromosomes could not have these structures. In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) has revealed sub-megabase topologically associating domains (TADs), which are the structural counterparts of replication domains.", "answer_start": 217}], "question": "How are topologically associating domains (TAD) associated with replication timing?", "id": "58ee217feda5a57672000015_014", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Mammalian genomes are partitioned into domains that replicate in a defined temporal order. These domains can replicate at similar times in all cell types (constitutive) or at cell type-specific times (developmental). Genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) has revealed sub-megabase topologically associating domains (TADs), which are the structural counterparts of replication domains. Hi-C also segregates inter-TAD contacts into defined 3D spatial compartments that align precisely to genome-wide replication timing profiles. Determinants of the replication-timing program are re-established during early G1 phase of each cell cycle and lost in G2 phase, but it is not known when TAD structure and inter-TAD contacts are re-established after their elimination during mitosis. Here, we use multiplexed 4C-seq to study dynamic changes in chromatin organization during early G1. We find that both establishment of TADs and their compartmentalization occur during early G1, within the same time frame as establishment of the replication-timing program. Once established, this 3D organization is preserved either after withdrawal into quiescence or for the remainder of interphase including G2 phase, implying 3D structure is not sufficient to maintain replication timing. Finally, we find that developmental domains are less well compartmentalized than constitutive domains and display chromatin properties that distinguish them from early and late constitutive domains. Overall, this study uncovers a strong connection between chromatin re-organization during G1, establishment of replication timing, and its developmental control."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "There is extensive transcription throughout the eukaryotic genome resulting in both antisense transcripts from coding regions and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) from intergenic regions", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "How are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) defined?", "id": "5a859184faa1ab7d2e000031_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "There is extensive transcription throughout the eukaryotic genome resulting in both antisense transcripts from coding regions and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) from intergenic regions.

In order to interrogate the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae for low abundance or rapidly turned over transcripts, we deleted elements of the RNA degradation machinery with the goal of preferentially increasing the relative abundance of such transcripts. We then used high-resolution tiling microarrays and ultra high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) to identify, map, and validate unannotated transcripts that are more abundant in the RNA degradation mutants relative to wild-type cells.

Recent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity. It remains unclear whether Rrp6 is directly involved in termination; however, Rrp6 has been implicated in the 3' end processing and degradation of ncRNA transcripts including CUTs. To determine the role of Rrp6 in NNS termination globally, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on total RNA and perform ChIP-exo analysis of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) localization. Deletion of RRP6 promotes hyper-elongation of multiple NNS-dependent transcripts resulting from both improperly processed 3' RNA ends and faulty transcript termination at specific target genes. The defects in RNAPII termination cause transcriptome-wide changes in mRNA expression through transcription interference and/or antisense repression, similar to previously reported effects of depleting Nrd1 from the nucleus. Elongated transcripts were identified within all classes of known NNS targets with the largest changes in transcription termination occurring at CUTs. Interestingly, the extended transcripts that we have detected in our studies show remarkable similarity to Nrd1-unterminated transcripts at many locations, suggesting that Rrp6 acts with the NNS complex globally to promote transcription termination in addition to 3' end RNA processing and/or degradation at specific targets."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " We describe here the genomic organization of the mouse Grg gene.

The ability of galunisertib to inhibit SMAD activity induced by neuroblastoma patient blood and bone marrow plasmas in neuroblastoma cells was tested. The impact of galunisertib on TGFβ1-induced inhibition of aNK cytotoxicity and ADCC in vitro and on anti-neuroblastoma activity in NOD-scid gamma (NSG) mice was determined.RESULTS: Neuroblastomas express TGFB1 and TGFBR1 mRNA.

Galunisertib, a TGF-β receptor type I kinase inhibitor, is a potential candidate for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Here, we evaluated the potency of galunisertib in a human ex vivo model of liver fibrosis.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Antifibrotic potency and associated mechanisms were studied ex vivo, using both healthy and cirrhotic human precision-cut liver slices. Fibrosis-related parameters, both transcriptional and translational level, were assessed after treatment with galunisertib.KEY RESULTS: Galunisertib showed a prominent antifibrotic potency. Phosphorylation of SMAD2 was inhibited, while that of SMAD1 remained unchanged. In healthy and cirrhotic human livers, spontaneous transcription of numerous genes encoding collagens, including collagen type I, α 1, collagen maturation, non-collageneous extracellular matrix (ECM) components, ECM remodelling and selected ECM receptors was significantly decreased. The reduction of fibrosis-related transcription was paralleled by a significant inhibition of procollagen I C-peptide released by both healthy and cirrhotic human liver slices. Moreover, galunisertib showed similar antifibrotic potency in human and rat lives.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Galunisertib is a drug that deserves to be further investigated for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Inhibition of SMAD2 phosphorylation is probably a central mechanism of action. In addition, blocking the production and maturation of collagens and promoting their degradation are related to the antifibrotic action of galunisertib.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "A xenograft model provided additional confirmation on combination of TGF-β inhibitor (Galunisertib) and autophagy inhibitor (CQ) to better \"turn off\" tumor growth.", "answer_start": 1642}], "question": "What is mechanism of action of galunisertib?", "id": "5a7604de83b0d9ea66000011_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by lethal aggressiveness and patients with GBM are in urgent need for new therapeutic avenues to improve quality of life. Current studies on tumor invasion focused on roles of cytokines in tumor microenvironment and numerous evidence suggests that TGF-β2 is abundant in glioma microenvironment and vital for glioma invasion. Autopagy is also emerging as a critical factor in aggressive behaviors of cancer cells; however, the relationship between TGF-β2 and autophagy in glioma has been poorly understood.METHODS: U251, T98 and U87 GBM cell lines as well as GBM cells from a primary human specimen were used in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the effect of TGF-β2 on autophagy. Western blot, qPCR, immunofluorescence and transmission-electron microscope were used to detect target molecular expression. Lentivirus and siRNA vehicle were introduced to establish cell lines, as well as mitotracker and seahorse experiment to study the metabolic process in glioma. Preclinical therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in orthotopic xenograft mouse models.RESULTS: Here we demonstrated that TGF-β2 activated autophagy in human glioma cell lines and knockdown of Smad2 or inhibition of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, attenuated TGF-β2-induced autophagy. TGF-β2-induced autophagy is important for glioma invasion due to the alteration of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metabolism conversion, particularly influencing mitochondria trafficking and membrane potential (△Ψm). Autopaghy also initiated a feedback on TGF-β2 in glioma by keeping its autocrine loop and affecting Smad2/3/7 expression. A xenograft model provided additional confirmation on combination of TGF-β inhibitor (Galunisertib) and autophagy inhibitor (CQ) to better \"turn off\" tumor growth.CONCLUSION: Our findings elucidated a potential mechanism of autophagy-associated glioma invasion that TGF-β2 could initiate autophagy via Smad and non-Smad pathway to promote glioma cells' invasion."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "urther targeting TGF-β/Smad3 signaling using galunisertib, an inhibitor of the TGF-β type I receptor kinase, can attenuate the secretion of miR-21 from glioma cells.

Eighty-one studies based on 59 articles were finally included. In our study, extracellular miR-21 was observed to exhibit an outstanding diagnostic accuracy in detecting brain cancer (area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve or AUC = 0.94), and this accuracy was more obvious in glioma diagnosis (AUC = 0.95). Our validation study (n = 45) further confirmed the diagnostic and prognostic role of miR-21 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for glioma. These findings inspired us to explore the biological function of miR-21. We next conducted mechanistic investigations to explain the secretory mechanisms of extracellular miR-21 in glioma. TGF-β/Smad3 signaling was identified to participate in mediating the release of miR-21 from glioma cells. Further targeting TGF-β/Smad3 signaling using galunisertib, an inhibitor of the TGF-β type I receptor kinase, can attenuate the secretion of miR-21 from glioma cells.

Transcription efficiency increased with L-loop size from 3 to 12 nucleotides of randomized sequence, and the smallest loop forced initiation to move into the stem region. To test further the need for any specific sequence we compared seven nucleotide L-loops composed of random, abasic and abasic-acyclic nucleotides, and all supported transcription by Pol III.

The immobilized polymerase enabled experiments showing that coligo transcripts can be formed through transcription termination without subsequent 3' end trimming. To better define the determinants of productive transcription, a structure-activity relationship study was performed using over 20 new coligos. The results show that unpaired nucleotides in the coligo stem facilitate circumtranscription, but also that internal loops and bulges should be kept small to avoid secondary transcription initiation sites. A polymerase termination sequence embedded in the double-stranded region of a hairpin-encoding coligo stem can antagonize transcription.

Fyn is an attractive target for AD therapeutics, not only based on its activation by Aβ via cellular prion protein but also due to its known interaction with tau, uniquely linking the two key pathologies in AD. Fyn is also a challenging target, with broad expression throughout the body and significant homology with other members of the Src family kinases, which may lead to unintended off-target effects.

This effect was not seen with GFAP which increased within 24 h following sCHI and progressively decreased by the 7 day time point regardless of the PrPC expression levels. Changes in the levels of all biomarkers were independent of gender. We further enhanced and expanded the quantitation of brain biomarkers with correlative studies using immunohisochemistry.

The 7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site.

Recombinant endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression. Our results indicate that Upc2 must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to take place.

Deleting YlUPC2, but not YlSRE1, confers susceptibility to azole drugs. Sterol levels are significantly reduced in the YlUPC2 deletion. RNA-seq analysis shows that hypoxic regulation of sterol synthesis genes in Y. lipolytica is predominantly mediated by Upc2. However, YlSre1 still retains a role in hypoxic regulation; growth of Y. lipolytica in hypoxic conditions is reduced in a Ylupc2 deletion and is abolished in a Ylsre1/Ylupc2 double deletion, and YlSre1 regulates sterol gene expression during hypoxia adaptation. We show that YlSRE1, and to a lesser extent YlUPC2, are required for switching from yeast to filamentous growth in hypoxia. Sre1 appears to have an ancestral role in the regulation of filamentation, which became decoupled from its role in sterol gene regulation by the arrival of Upc2 in the Saccharomycotina."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Recombinant endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression.", "answer_start": 1085}], "question": "Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?", "id": "590c74d170f9fc6f0f00001e_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback mechanism.

Emerging high-throughput sequencing methods as well as first reports on confirmed functions have sparked new interest in this RNA species. However, the computational detection and quantification tools are still limited.RESULTS: We developed the software tandem, DCC and CircTest DCC uses output from the STAR read mapper to systematically detect back-splice junctions in next-generation sequencing data. DCC applies a series of filters and integrates data across replicate sets to arrive at a precise list of circRNA candidates. We assessed the detection performance of DCC on a newly generated mouse brain data set and publicly available sequencing data. Our software achieves a much higher precision than state-of-the-art competitors at similar sensitivity levels. Moreover, DCC estimates circRNA versus host gene expression from counting junction and non-junction reads. These read counts are finally used to test for host gene-independence of circRNA expression across different experimental conditions by our R package CircTest We demonstrate the benefits of this approach on previously reported age-dependent circRNAs in the fruit fly.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of DCC and CircTest is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL) version 3 and available from https://github.com/dieterich-lab/[DCC or CircTest].CONTACT: christoph.dieterich@age.mpg.deSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author 2015.

In this work, we have developed a computational pipeline named UROBORUS to detect circRNAs in total RNA-seq data.

UROBORUS is an efficient tool that can detect circRNAs with low expression levels in total RNA-seq without RNase R treatment. The circRNAs expression profiling revealed more than 476 circular RNAs differentially expressed in control brain tissues and gliomas. Together with parental gene expression, we found that circRNA and its parental gene have diversified expression patterns in gliomas and control brain tissues.

X-ray analysis shows that the C-ribbon has detached from its site on the Pol II surface and is mobile.

Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This present study also suggests that linkage of editing should be considered in elucidating the functional consequences of RNA editing."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites.", "answer_start": 314}], "question": "Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?", "id": "58e8a2fc3e8b6dc87c00000c_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among animals for this purpose.

This process is pervasive in the mitochondria of many eukaryotes, where it predominantly results in the restoration of ancestral protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence.

Heart valve structure and competence is maintained by heart valve cells through a process of continuous turnover extracellular matrix (ECM). Degenerative (myxomatous) mitral valve disease (DMVD) is an important disease associated with aging in both dogs and humans. DMVD is increasingly regarded as a disease with identifiable signaling mechanisms that control key genes associated with regulation and dysregulation of ECM homeostasis. Initiating stimuli for these signaling pathways have not been fully elucidated but likely include both mechanical and chemical stimuli. Signaling pathways implicated in DMVD include serotonin, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), and heart valve developmental pathways. High circulating serotonin (carcinoid syndrome) and serotoninergic drugs are known to cause valvulopathy that shares pathologic features with DMVD. Recent evidence supports a local serotonin signaling mechanism, possibly triggered by high tensile loading on heart valves. Serotonin initiates TGFβ signaling, which in turn has been strongly implicated in canine DMVD. Recent evidence suggests that degenerative aortic and mitral valve disease may involve pathologic processes that mimic osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, respectively. These processes may be mediated by developmental pathways shared by heart valves, bone, and cartilage. These pathways include bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling.

Three NIH cohorts were compared: prepropranolol (20 in group 1; 2003-2009), propranolol (25 in group 2; 2009-2011), and nonpropranolol (13 in group 3; 2009-2011) treatment.INTERVENTIONS: Analysis of systemic medical, laser, or surgical therapies for NIH.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The study plan was created to detect a change in invasive therapy for NIH. Data collected included presenting age, sex, affected nasal subunits, infantile hemangioma morphologic characteristics, treatment type and number, and primary treating service. An NIH grading system, based on nasal subunit involvement, helped quantify treatment change. Descriptive statistics summarized data, and a Cox proportional hazards regression model evaluated propranolol use and the likelihood of invasive treatments (surgical excision or laser).RESULTS: Of the 95 patients identified, 58 met inclusion criteria: 20 in group 1 (mean age, 4.8 months), 25 in group 2 (mean age, 4.9 months), and 13 in group 3 (mean age, 4.9 months). Nasal infantile hemangiomas involved the nasal tip subunit in 33 of 58 patients (56.9%). Eight of 13 patients (61.5%) in group 3 frequently had small NIH (grade 1).

The coiled-coil domain of Osh7p was found to interact with Vps4p in a yeast two-hybrid screen and the interaction between Osh7p and Vps4p appears to be regulated by ergosterol. Deletion of VPS4 induced a dramatic increase in the membrane-associated pools of Osh6p and Osh7p and also caused a decrease in sterol esterification, which was suppressed by overexpression of OSH7. Lastly, overexpression of the coiled-coil domain of Osh7p (Osh7pCC) resulted in a multivesicular body sorting defect, suggesting a dominant negative role of Osh7pCC possibly through inhibiting Vps4p function.

However, there has been no published evidence on the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for this indication.OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in ipilimumab-naïve patients with unresectable or meta-static melanoma from a U.S. integrated health system perspective.METHODS: A partitioned-survival model was developed, which divided overall survival time into progression-free survival and postprogression survival. The model used Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival from a recent randomized phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006) that compared pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. Extrapolation of progression-free survival and overall survival beyond the clinical trial was based on parametric functions and literature data. The base-case time horizon was 20 years, and costs and health outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Clinical data-including progression-free survival and overall survival data spanning a median follow-up time of 15 months, as well as quality of life and adverse event data from the ongoing KEYNOTE-006 trial-and cost data from public sources were used to populate the model. Costs included those of drug acquisition, treatment administration, adverse event management, and disease management of advanced melanoma. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost difference per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was the main outcome, and a series of sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results.RESULTS: In the base case, pembrolizumab was projected to increase the life expectancy of U.S. patients with advanced melanoma by 1.14 years, corresponding to a gain of 0.79 discounted QALYs over ipilimumab. The model also projected an average increase of $63,680 in discounted perpatient costs of treatment with pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab. The corresponding ICER was $81,091 per QALY ($68,712 per life-year) over a 20-year time horizon. With $100,000 per QALY as the threshold, when input parameters were varied in deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses, the use of pembrolizumab was cost-effective relative to ipilimumab in most ranges. Further, in a comprehensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the ICER was cost-effective in 83% of the simulations.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ipilimumab, pembrolizumab had higher expected QALYs and was cost-effective for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma from a U.S. integrated health system perspective.DISCLOSURES: This study was supported by funding from Merck & Co., which reviewed and approved the manuscript before journal submission.

We present the final protocol-specified survival analysis.METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 87 academic institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA). We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to one of two dose regimens of pembrolizumab, or one regimen of ipilimumab, using a centralised, computer-generated allocation schedule. Treatment assignments used blocked randomisation within strata. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma), and up to one previous systemic therapy (excluding anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 agents). Secondary eligibility criteria are described later. Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastases or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids. The primary outcome was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review at week 12, then every 6 weeks up to week 48, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival was assessed every 12 weeks, and final analysis occurred after all patients were followed up for at least 21 months. Primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients) and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). Data cutoff date for this analysis was Dec 3, 2015. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319.FINDINGS: Between Sept 18, 2013, and March 3, 2014, 834 patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n=279), intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n=277), or intravenous ipilimumab every 3 weeks (ipilimumab for four doses; n=278). One patient in the pembrolizumab 2 week group and 22 patients in the ipilimumab group withdrew consent and did not receive treatment. A total of 811 patients received at least one dose of study treatment. Median follow-up was 22·9 months; 383 patients died. Median overall survival was not reached in either pembrolizumab group and was 16·0 months with ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0·68, 95% CI 0·53-0·87 for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0·0009 and 0·68, 0·53-0·86 for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0·0008). 24-month overall survival rate was 55% in the 2-week group, 55% in the 3-week group, and 43% in the ipilimumab group.INTERPRETATION: Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules. These conclusions further support the use of pembrolizumab as a standard of care for advanced melanoma.FUNDING: Merck & Co.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients) and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). Data cutoff date for this analysis was Dec 3, 2015. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319.FINDINGS: Between Sept 18, 2013, and March 3, 2014, 834 patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n=279), intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n=277), or intravenous ipilimumab every 3 weeks (ipilimumab for four doses; n=278). One patient in the pembrolizumab 2 week group and 22 patients in the ipilimumab group withdrew consent and did not receive treatment. A total of 811 patients received at least one dose of study treatment. Median follow-up was 22·9 months; 383 patients died. Median overall survival was not reached in either pembrolizumab group and was 16·0 months with ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0·68, 95% CI 0·53-0·87 for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0·0009 and 0·68, 0·53-0·86 for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0·0008). 24-month overall survival rate was 55% in the 2-week group, 55% in the 3-week group, and 43% in the ipilimumab group.INTERPRETATION: Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules. These conclusions further support the use of pembrolizumab as a standard of care for advanced melanoma.FUNDING: Merck & Co.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Bone mineral density was evaluated by densitometric scanning of spine (L2-L4 T-score) and/or femoral neck (Neck T-score) and/or total hip (Total Hip T-score). Total cholesterol (TC), fasting glucose, arterial blood pressure, medical history, and family history were obtained. The risk of fatal-CVD was assessed by Euro Heart Score (EHS), and major osteoporotic (MOFR) and hip fracture risk (HFR) by the FRAX scale.RESULTS: 80% of the patients (32/40) with osteoporosis and 51% (20/39) of the patients without osteoporosis revealed a HeartScore ≥ 5%.

Clinical information was obtained from a questionnaire of their case history and medical records. FRAX tool was administered. Their lumber spine and left femoral BMD were determined by dual energy X ray absorptiometry. The gender, age, disease duration, menopause status, body mass index (BMI) and accumulative dose of glucocorticoid were obtained in retrospect. Correlation analysis was conducted between the BMD and clinical information.RESULTS: The study population (female, 77.5%) had a mean age of 59.4 years, in which 10 (13%) patients showed a normal BMD, 67 (87%) were osteopenia or osteoporosis, while 32 patients (16%) had fragile fracture. Compared with the patients with normal BMD, the subjects with low BMD had significantly older age, longer period for corticoids usage, higher day dose and accumulated dose of corticoids.The 10-year fracture risk of sustaining major osteoporotic fractures and hip fracture was higher. No significant difference was observed between the 10-year fracture risks calculated with BMD and without BMD. The values of the different area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for major and hip fractures calculated in three ways: without BMD, with the femoral neck BMD, and with T-score. The best result was for FRAX tool for hip fracture with the T-score (AUC 0.899). A stepwise multivariate linear regression model was constructed to explore the relationship between the different clinical factors studied and a low BMD. Three statistically significant variables for lumber BMD were pain on visual assessment scale (VAS) (P=0.02), fracture history (P=0.003) and a higher steroid accumulated dose (P=0.008).

Paramedics who attend to patients who have fallen may be well placed to assess future fracture risk, using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and communicate that information directly to general practitioners (GPs).METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This feasibility study takes the form of a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial aimed at exploring and refining issues of study design, recruitment, retention, sample size and acceptability preceding a large-scale study with fracture as the end point. Patients (aged >50) who fall, call an ambulance, are attended by a study paramedic and give verbal consent will be asked FRAX and fall questions.

Multivariable analyses were performed to determine: (i) cross-sectional association between FRAX scores and falls risk score (Elderly Falls Screening Test, EFST) and (ii) prospective relationship between FRAX and time to a fall.RESULTS: There was an association between FRAX (hip with BMD) and EFST scores (β = 0.07, p < 0.001). After adjustment for sex and age, the relationship became non-significant (β = 0.00, p = 0.79). The risk of incident falls increased with increasing FRAX (hip with BMD) score (unadjusted HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.07). After adjustment for age and sex, the relationship became non-significant (1.01, 95% CI 0.97, 1.05).CONCLUSIONS: There is a weak positive correlation between FRAX and falls risk score, that is likely explained by the inclusion of age and sex in the FRAX model. These data suggest that FRAX score may not be a robust surrogate for falls risk and that inclusion of falls in fracture risk assessment should be further explored.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS A complicated course (ie, death, colectomy, or ICU admission due to CDI) was observed in 31 patients (21%), and 23 patients (16%) died within 30 days of CDI diagnosis. The performance of all 3 prediction models was poor when applied to the total validation cohort with an estimated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 for the Hensgens model, 0.54 for the Na model, and 0.61 for the Welfare model. For those patients diagnosed with CDI due to non-outbreak strains, the prediction model developed by Hensgens performed the best, with an AUC of 0.78. CONCLUSION All 3 prediction models performed poorly when using our total cohort, which included CDI cases from an outbreak as well as endemic cases. The prediction model of Hensgens performed relatively well for patients diagnosed with CDI due to non-outbreak strains, and this model may be useful in endemic settings.

The aim of this study was to determine whether early recurrence risk was higher after infection with ribotype 027 (outbreak strain) compared with infection with endemic strain types of C. difficile.METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed with CDI between May 2013 and March 2014 were included (outbreak strain, and non-outbreak strains). Patients who developed recurrent CDI within 30 days after completion of CDI treatment, were compared with patients without a recurrence. Medical charts were reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics. General practitioners were contacted to complete data about the occurrence of recurrent CDI, and the use of medication after hospital discharge.RESULTS: In total, 135 patients were at risk for the development of recurrent CDI; 74 patients were infected by ribotype 027, and 61 patients by other ribotypes. Thirty-nine patients (29%) developed recurrent CDI within 30 days after completion of CDI treatment. In multivariable analysis, age ≥70 years (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.54-6.03), and a duration of CDI treatment ≥11 days (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.00-3.69) were clearly associated with recurrence; infection with ribotype 027 showed a HR of 1.72 (95% CI 0.88-3.33).CONCLUSION: During this outbreak of C. difficile in a tertiary care centre, age and a prolonged duration of CDI therapy (which is most likely a marker of underlying disease severity) were the main risk factors for recurrent CDI. This points to host factors as more important predictors for recurrent CDI than strain type or antibiotic use.Copyright © 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

However, C. difficile 027 infections have been rarely reported in Asia, particularly in China.RESULTS: In this study, we identified a rare C. difficile bloodstream infection (BSI) from three isolates of a patient during repeated hospital admission. This finding triggered a retrospective epidemiological study to scan all cases and strains emerged from this ward during the past three years. Using medical personnel interviews, medical record reviews and the genomic epidemiology, two outbreaks in 2012 and 2013-2014 were identified. Through using whole genome sequencing, we succeeded to trace the origin of the BSI strain. Surprisingly, we found the genome sequences were similar to C. difficile 027 strain R20291, indicating the occurrence of a rare C. difficile 027 strain in China. Integrated epidemiological investigation and whole genome sequencing of all strains, we constructed a nosocomial transmission map of these two C. difficile 027 outbreaks and traced the origin of the infection.CONCLUSIONS: By genome sequencing, spatio-temporal analysis and field epidemiology investigation, we can estimate their complex transform network and reveal the possible modes of transmission in this ward.

To determine what hospital-associated factors drove the outbreak of this particular strain we performed a case-control study.METHODS: Cases (n = 79), diagnosed with CDI due to C. difficile ribotype 027 were matched for age and treating medical specialty to four control patients (n = 316). Patients diagnosed with CDI due to other ribotypes were included as a second control group. A random selection of C. difficile ribotype 027 strains (n = 10) was genotyped by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).FINDINGS: WGS showed the outbreak was likely caused by a single strain of C. difficile (two or less single-nucleotide variants between isolates). Ninety-five percent of cases had used antibiotics, compared to 56% of controls. Previous admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR: 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-5.6), longer length of stay (LOS), and recent hospital admission were associated with CDI ribotype 027. Cases were less likely to have been admitted to a ward with a known isolated CDI patient (OR: 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.6). Analysis of patients who stayed at the ICU (35 cases; 51 controls), indicated that the use of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) and a longer LOS in the ICU were associated with CDI risk.INTERPRETATION: In this large outbreak, any antibiotic use, including SDD use, appeared as a prerequisite for acquisition of the outbreak strain.

Since 2008, molecular typing of C. difficile was regularly performed for symptomatic hospitalized patients by surface-layer protein A sequence typing (slpAST), which is an established highly standardized technique for genotyping of C. difficile. The results were assigned to known ribotypes for better comparison to international data. It could be demonstrated that distribution of genotypes was different between age groups. Older patients were predominantly infected with ribotype 001 and 027, whereas ribotype 027 was not detected in the pediatric population. Molecular typing of German isolates sent to the advisory laboratory between 2011 and 2013 revealed that ribotype 027 is present with high percentages in most German regions except for the very North. In conclusion, optimized testing of all hospitalized patients with diarrhea should be generally implemented to avoid under-diagnosis of C. difficile infection.

Yeast cells do not require TFIIS for viability, unless they suffer severe transcriptional stress due to NTP-depleting drugs like 6-azauracil or mycophenolic acid. In order to broaden our knowledge on the role of TFIIS under transcriptional stress, we carried out a genetic screening for suppressors of TFIIS-lacking cells' sensitivity to 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid. Five suppressors were identified, four of which were related to the transcriptional regulation of those genes encoding ribosomal components [rRNAs and ribosomal proteins (RP)], including global regulator SFP1.

Yeast cells do not require TFIIS for viability, unless they suffer severe transcriptional stress due to NTP-depleting drugs like 6-azauracil or mycophenolic acid. In order to broaden our knowledge on the role of TFIIS under transcriptional stress, we carried out a genetic screening for suppressors of TFIIS-lacking cells' sensitivity to 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid. Five suppressors were identified, four of which were related to the transcriptional regulation of those genes encoding ribosomal components [rRNAs and ribosomal proteins (RP)], including global regulator SFP1.

Rpb9, a small subunit of RNA polymerase II, enhances the cleavage stimulation activity of S-II. Here, we investigated the role of nascent transcript cleavage stimulation activity on the maintenance of transcriptional fidelity in yeast. In yeast, S-II is encoded by the DST1 gene. Disruption of the DST1 gene decreased transcriptional fidelity in cells. Mutations in the DST1 gene that reduce the S-II cleavage stimulation activity led to decreased transcriptional fidelity in cells. A disruption mutant of the RPB9 gene also had decreased transcriptional fidelity. Expression of mutant Rpb9 proteins that are unable to enhance the S-II cleavage stimulation activity failed to restore the phenotype. These results suggest that both S-II and Rpb9 maintain transcriptional fidelity by stimulating the cleavage activity intrinsic to RNA polymerase II. Also, a DST1 and RPB9 double mutant had more severe transcriptional fidelity defect compared with the DST1 gene deletion mutant, suggesting that Rpb9 maintains transcriptional fidelity via two mechanisms, enhancement of S-II dependent cleavage stimulation and S-II independent function(s)."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "TFIIS is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates transcript cleavage activity of arrested RNA polymerase II (Pol II).", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the function of the TFIIS transcriptional factor (Dst1) in yeast?", "id": "5a003e0a966455904c000001_019", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "TFIIS is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates transcript cleavage activity of arrested RNA polymerase II (Pol II).

Under normal growth conditions, TFIIS was detected on Pol II-transcribed genes, and TFIIS occupancy was well correlated with that of Pol II, indicating that TFIIS recruitment is not restricted to NTP-depleted cells. Unexpectedly, TFIIS was also detected on almost all Pol III-transcribed genes. TFIIS and Pol III occupancies correlated well genome-wide on this novel class of targets.

However the spectrum of alterations that occur at distal regulatory regions has not been extensively studied. To address this we used Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) to compare the genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy profiles between normal and cancer cell line models of the breast and prostate.

Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a \"ground state\" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the final spliced mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions. Genes marked by the active modification H3K4m3 are characterized by lower nucleosome occupancy before the transcription start site compared to genes marked by the inactive modification H3K27m3, while bivalent domains, genes associated with both marks, lie exactly in the middle. Combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks (chromatin states) are associated with unique nucleosome profiles. Nucleosome organization varies around transcription factor binding in enhancers versus promoters. DNA methylation is associated with increasing nucleosome occupancy and different types of methylations have distinct location preferences within the nucleosome core particle. Finally, computational analysis of nucleosome organization alone is sufficient to elucidate much of the circuitry of pluripotency. Our results, suggest that nucleosome organization is associated with numerous genomic and epigenomic processes and can be used to elucidate cellular identity."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins.", "answer_start": 378}], "question": "Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?", "id": "5a43a214966455904c000009_021", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "CpG islands (CGIs) are commonly used as genomic markers to study the patterns and regulatory consequences of DNA methylation.

Evolutionary origins of CGIs are also highly heterogeneous. In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins. We discover novel 'clusters' of CGIs according to their patterns of DNA methylation; the stably hypomethylated CGI cluster (cluster I), sperm-hypomethylated CGI cluster (cluster II), and variably methylated CGI cluster (cluster III). These epigenomic CGI clusters are strikingly distinct at multiple biological features including genomic, evolutionary, and functional characteristics. At the genomic level, the stably hypomethylated CGI cluster tends to be longer and harbors many more CpG dinucleotides than those in other clusters. They are also frequently associated with promoters, while CGI clusters II and III mostly reside in intragenic or intergenic regions and exhibit highly tissue-specific DNA methylation. Functional ontology terms and transcriptional profiles co-vary with CGI clusters, indicating that the regulatory functions of CGIs are tightly linked to their heterogeneity. Finally, CGIs associated with distinctive biological processes, such as diseases, aging, and imprinting, occur disproportionately across CGI clusters. These new findings provide an effective means to combine existing knowledge on CGIs into a genomic context while bringing new insights that elucidate the significance of DNA methylation across different biological conditions and demography."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF.", "answer_start": 545}], "question": "Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?", "id": "5a43a214966455904c000009_022", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "During differentiation of embryonic stem cells, chromatin reorganizes to establish cell type-specific expression programs.

Here, we evaluate the scope of global epigenetic alterations at enhancers and insulator elements in prostate and breast cancer cells using simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy (NOMe-seq). We find that the genomic location of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) is mostly cell type specific and preferentially found at enhancers in normal cells. In cancer cells, however, we observe a global reconfiguration of NDRs at distal regulatory elements coupled with a substantial reorganization of the cancer methylome. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Remarkably, we show that nucleosomes remain strongly organized and phased at many facultative distal regulatory elements, even in the absence of a NDR as an anchor. Finally, we find that key transcription factor (TF) binding sites also show extensive peripheral nucleosome phasing, suggesting the potential for TFs to organize NDRs genome-wide and contribute to deregulation of cancer epigenomes.

As with many other psychiatric disorders, a genetic basis for depression has been identified. Evidence for the role of circadian genes in depression is particularly compelling. Circadian gene mutations are also associated with circadian rhythm disorders such as familial advanced sleep phase syndrome, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome. Such disorders, plus the other manifestations of a disrupted circadian system such as hormone dysregulation, are often observed among those with depression. This suggests a shared aetiology between circadian disruption and depression, although the exact mechanisms underlying the association are unclear. This paper reviews the molecular mechanisms involved in depression, with an emphasis on circadian genes. Twin studies in depression have reported probandwise concordance rates of 40% and 70% using narrow and broad diagnostic criteria, respectively, and heritability of over 85% for bipolar disorder. In association studies, increased susceptibility to depression has been noted in those with polymorphisms in the following: D-amino-acid-oxidase activator/G30 gene complex, glucocorticoid receptor gene, serotonin transporter gene, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene, dopamine transporter gene and G protein-coupled receptor 50 gene. Polymorphisms in these genes have also been linked to a better or worse response to antidepressant therapy, an increased likelihood of responding poorly to adversity and increased suicide ideation. Polymorphisms in the CLOCK, BMAL1, Per3 and TIMELESS genes have been associated with susceptibility to mood disorder, and single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in several circadian genes have been observed among those displaying certain circadian phenotypes, including worse mood in the evening, insomnia in mania and early, middle or late insomnia in depression. Manipulation of the circadian timing system via sleep deprivation, bright light or pharmacological therapy has also been shown to alleviate depressive symptoms, providing further evidence for the role of circadian dysfunction in depression pathophysiology. The new antidepressant agomelatine is the first melatonergic antidepressant with an innovative mode of action: it is a melatonergic MT(1), MT(2) receptor agonist and 5-HT(2c) antagonist, and is able to restore the internal clock, which is profoundly disturbed in depression, thus being efficacious in major depressive disorders. In conclusion, a wealth of evidence is now available supporting a genetic basis for depression.

Healthy male volunteers aged 18-45 years received between 20 mg and 8 g idarucizumab as a 1-hour intravenous infusion in 10 sequential dose groups, or 1, 2 or 4 g idarucizumab as a 5-minute infusion. Subjects within each dose group were randomised 3:1 to idarucizumab or placebo. A total of 110 randomised subjects received study drug (27 placebo, 83 idarucizumab). Peak and total exposure to idarucizumab increased proportionally with dose. Maximum plasma concentrations were achieved near the end of infusion, followed by a rapid decline, with an initial idarucizumab half-life of ~45 minutes. For the 5-minute infusions, this resulted in a reduction of plasma concentrations to less than 5 % of peak within 4 hours. Idarucizumab (in the absence of dabigatran) had no effect on coagulation parameters or endogenous thrombin potential. Overall adverse event (AE) frequency was similar for idarucizumab and placebo, and no relationship with idarucizumab dose was observed. Drug-related AEs (primary endpoint) were rare (occurring in 2 placebo and 3 idarucizumab subjects) and were mostly of mild intensity; none of them resulted in study discontinuation.

By reversing the anticoagulating effect of dabigatran etexilate with idarucizumab (Praxbind), patients presenting with an acute ischemic stroke can now be eligible for thrombolysis.PATIENT: We describe our experience with idarucizumab in a 71-year-old male patient pretreated with dabigatran etexilate. The patient arrived with a hemiparesis, central facial palsy, and dysarthria.METHOD: Dabigatran etexilate was antagonized with idarucizumab, approximately 2.5 hours after the patient's last dose. Immediately after the infusion of idarucizumab, the patient received thrombolytic therapy.RESULTS: The hemiparesis and the central facial palsy were fully remitted 3 days after the onset of symptoms, and the dysarthria was remitted 2 days afterwards.DISCUSSION: Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are widely used for the prevention of embolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran etexilate is an oral thrombin inhibitor that can be reversed by idarucizumab. Idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment, directly binds dabigatran etexilate and neutralizes its activity.CONCLUSION: Reversal of dabigatran etexilate using idarucizumab was safe and successful with no recombinant tissue plasminogen activator interactions.Copyright © 2017 National Stroke Association.

Inflammation plays a major role in containing and resolving infection and may also occur under sterile conditions. The cardinal signs of inflammation dolor, calor, tumor and rubor are intrinsically associated with events including vasodilatation, edema and leukocyte trafficking into the site of inflammation. If uncontrolled or unresolved, inflammation itself can lead to further tissue damage and give rise to chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity with eventual loss of organ function. It is now evident that the resolution of inflammation is an active continuous process that occurs during an acute inflammatory episode. Successful resolution requires activation of endogenous programs with switch from production of pro-inflammatory towards pro-resolving molecules, such as specific lipid mediators and annexin A1, and the non-phlogistic elimination of granulocytes by apoptosis with subsequent removal by surrounding macrophages. These processes ensure rapid restoration of tissue homeostasis. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of resolution of inflammation, highlighting the pharmacological strategies that may interfere with the molecular pathways which control leukocyte survival and clearance.

Although \"neuroinflammation\" is the term commonly used to describe the pathological changes, it fails to define adequately the process that is taking place. The reaction is neither a nonspecific response to injury, as classically implied for inflammatory reactions, nor an autoimmune reaction, despite the directed attack against plaques and extracellular tangles. It is most appropriately defined as an innate immunoreaction. The fact that such a reaction can be mounted by brain, an organ frequently described as being immunologically privileged, suggests that a reevaluation is required of the dimensions of the innate immune system, including how it operates at the tissue level. The innate immune system is primitive, while the adaptive immune system, which is directed by peripheral immune organs, is an invention of vertebrates. Even in vertebrates, however, the innate immune system is the first line of defense. Much more needs to be learned about the operation of the innate immune system in health and disease.

He bases his observations on the four cardinal signs of Celsus (redness, heat, swelling and pain). Inflammation is then divided into three main groups: adhesive, suppurative and ulcerative. He discusses the nature of pus and the formation and treatment of abscesses. He describes his experiments on the transplantation of tissues under the general heading of adhesive inflammation. This, he states, underlies the union of wounds and thus the union of tissues after transplantation. Although unaware of the role of infecting organisms as a cause of inflammation, he makes observations on inflammation in smallpox, venereal infections and tuberculosis.

If uncontrolled or unresolved, inflammation itself can lead to further tissue damage and give rise to chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity with eventual loss of organ function. It is now evident that the resolution of inflammation is an active continuous process that occurs during an acute inflammatory episode. Successful resolution requires activation of endogenous programs with switch from production of pro-inflammatory towards pro-resolving molecules, such as specific lipid mediators and annexin A1, and the non-phlogistic elimination of granulocytes by apoptosis with subsequent removal by surrounding macrophages. These processes ensure rapid restoration of tissue homeostasis.

The aim of the study is to test the antimicrobial efficacy of these plants against some pathogens associated with respiratory disease and to determine if there is any validation for the traditional use against Mycobacterium species.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medium polar extracts were prepared in MeOH/DCM (1:1, v/v) from the plant parts of each species used traditionally and were assayed against pathogens associated with respiratory tract ailments [Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883) and Morexella cattarhalis (ATCC 14468)] using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. Two additional faster growing Mycobacterium strains [Mycobacterium smegmatis (ATCC 23246) and Mycobacterium aurum (NCTC 10437)] were included in the assay as predictive test organisms for the more pathogenic strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis.RESULTS: Some plant species, such as Alchornea floribunda, Musanga cecropioides (both leaves and stem bark), Tetracera potatoria and Xylopia aethiopica (stem bark), were effective in inhibiting Morexella cattarhalis, having MIC values between 65 and 250 μg/mL.

To test if the chicken β-globin HS4 (cHS4) chromatin insulator might interfere with methylation imprinting establishment at the H19 ICR, we inserted the H19 ICR fragment, flanked by a set of floxed cHS4 core sequences, into a human β-globin locus YAC and generated TgM (insulated ICR' TgM).

Curiously, however, the transgenic H19 ICR was not methylated in sperm, which was distinct from that seen in the endogenous locus. Here, we reevaluated the ability of the H19 ICR to mark the parental origin using more rigid criteria. In the testis, the methylation levels of the solitary 2.9-kbp transgenic ICR fragment varied significantly between six transgenic mouse lines. However, in somatic cells, the paternally inherited ICR fragment exhibited consistently higher methylation levels at five out of six randomly integrated sites in the mouse genome. These results clearly demonstrated that the H19 ICR could acquire parent-of-origin-dependent methylation after fertilization independently of the chromosomal integration site or the prerequisite methylation acquisition in male germ cells."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Microdeletions at the human H19/IGF2 ICR (IC1) are proposed to be responsible for IC1 epimutations associated with imprinting disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS).", "answer_start": 648}], "question": "What is the function of the H19 (ICR) locus in the human genome?", "id": "5a86ecc7faa1ab7d2e000039_024", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Parent-of-origin-specific expression at imprinted genes is regulated by allele-specific DNA methylation at imprinting control regions (ICRs). This mechanism of gene regulation, where one element controls allelic expression of multiple genes, is not fully understood. Furthermore, the mechanism of gene dysregulation through ICR epimutations, such as loss or gain of DNA methylation, remains a mystery. We have used genetic mouse models to dissect ICR-mediated genetic and epigenetic regulation of imprinted gene expression. The H19/insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) ICR has a multifunctional role including insulation, activation and repression. Microdeletions at the human H19/IGF2 ICR (IC1) are proposed to be responsible for IC1 epimutations associated with imprinting disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Here, we have generated and characterized a mouse model that mimics BWS microdeletions to define the role of the deleted sequence in establishing and maintaining epigenetic marks and imprinted expression at the H19/IGF2 locus. These mice carry a 1.3 kb deletion at the H19/Igf2 ICR [Δ2,3] removing two of four CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites and the intervening sequence, ∼75% of the ICR. Surprisingly, the Δ2,3 deletion does not perturb DNA methylation at the ICR; however, it does disrupt imprinted expression. While repressive functions of the ICR are compromised by the deletion regardless of tissue type, insulator function is only disrupted in tissues of mesodermal origin where a significant amount of CTCF is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated. These findings suggest that insulator activity of the H19/Igf2 ICR varies by cell type and may depend on cell-specific enhancers as well as posttranslational modifications of the insulator protein CTCF."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "CTCF binding sites and DNA methylation at the ICR have previously been identified as key cis-acting elements required for proper H19/Igf2 imprinting.", "answer_start": 222}], "question": "What is the function of the H19 (ICR) locus in the human genome?", "id": "5a86ecc7faa1ab7d2e000039_025", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Expression of coregulated imprinted genes, H19 and Igf2, is monoallelic and parent-of-origin-dependent.

Manta is optimized for rapid germline and somatic analysis, calling structural variants, medium-sized indels and large insertions on standard compute hardware in less than a tenth of the time that comparable methods require to identify only subsets of these variant types: for example NA12878 at 50× genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20 min. Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base-pair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance. We provide Manta as a community resource to facilitate practical and routine structural variant analysis in clinical and research sequencing scenarios.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Manta is released under the open-source GPLv3 license.

In Kummell's disease, intravertebral instability from nonunion between the cement and bone after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) can cause persistent severe pain and dysfunction. A 75-year-old woman presented with severe pain in the lower back, both buttocks, groin, and both posterior thighs for a period of 30 days. Lumbar radiographs and magnetic resonance images showed an acute compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra with an intravertebral cleft filled with fluid. The patient underwent PVP for the L1 compression fracture; however, this failed to provide sufficient pain relief. The patient was re-evaluated with dynamic radiography, and intravertebral instability and bone cement displacement of the L1 vertebra were detected. Repeat PVP was performed. After the procedure, intravertebral instability was restored and her pain completely subsided. PVP is a good treatment choice for symptomatic Kummell's disease. However, there is no consensus on the best technique of injecting bone cement to achieve optimal results. It is important to inject more bone cement than the volume of the intravertebral cleft to prevent instability caused by nonunion in PVP for Kummell's disease.

Understanding the carefully coordinated series of molecular events that culminate in the recruitment of leukocytes to the gut has resulted in novel interventions with new capabilities in treating both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Key Messages: Natalizumab, an anti-α4 integrin antibody, was the first agent to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for the induction and maintenance of response and remission in Crohn's disease. Widespread adoption was mitigated by the previously unknown risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with this approach. Current approaches employ a more selective inhibition of adhesion molecules targeting the gut to avoid broad suppression of surveillance for JC virus, the causal pathogen of PML. Subsequently, vedolizumab, a humanized anti-α4β7 integrin antibody, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with IBD and has an excellent safety profile. To date, there have been no cases of PML in patients treated with vedolizumab, suggesting that this more selective agent does not have the same risk for PML as natalizumab. Other agents target β7 integrin (etrolizumab) and mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule-1, the endothelial ligand of α4β7 integrin. Efforts to inhibit the chemokine receptor CCR9 using the agent CCX282-B in Crohn's disease were not successful.

The advent of monoclonal antibodies (anti-tumor necrosis factor, anti-integrin, anti-interleukin -23) has revolutionized IBD management. Nevertheless, these agents, with potential for immunogenicity, are associated with high rates of response loss and disease relapse over time. They are also associated with high production costs. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a membrane-derived lysophospholipid signaling molecule, is implicated in a vast array of physiological and pathophysiological processes, primarily via extracellular activation of S1P1-S1P5 receptors. S1P1, S1P4 and S1P5 are involved in regulation of the immune system, while S1P2 and S1P3 may be associated with cardiovascular, pulmonary, and theoretical cancer-related risks. Targeting S1P receptors for inflammatory conditions has been successful in clinical trials leading to approval of the non-selective S1P modulator, fingolimod, for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. However, the association of this non-selective S1P modulator with serious adverse events provides the rationale for developing more selective S1P receptor modulators. Until recently, three S1P modulators with differing selectivity for S1P receptors were in clinical development for IBD: ozanimod (RPC1063), etrasimod (APD334) and amiselimod (MT-1303). The development of amiselimod has been stopped as Biogen are currently focusing on other drugs in its portfolio.

As well as providing superior treatments for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such therapies also offer unrivalled opportunities to study the underlying immunopathological basis of these conditions.In this review, we explore recent approaches to the treatment of IMIDs and the insights to pathobiology that they provide. We review novel biologic agents targeting the T-helper 17 axis, including therapies directed towards interleukin (IL)-17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab), IL-17R (brodalumab), IL-12/23p40 (ustekinumab, briakinumab) and IL-23p19 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab, brazikumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab). We also present an overview of biologics active against type I and II interferons, including sifalumumab, rontalizumab, anifrolumab and fontolizumab. Emerging strategies to interfere with cellular adhesion processes involved in lymphocyte recruitment are discussed, including both integrin blockade (natalizumab, vedolizumab, etrolizumab) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor inhibition (fingolimod, ozanimod). We summarise the development and recent application of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in the treatment of IMIDs, including first-generation pan-JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, peficitinib) and second-generation selective JAK inhibitors (decernotinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib). New biologics targeting B-cells (including ocrelizumab, veltuzumab, tabalumab and atacicept) and the development of novel strategies for regulatory T-cell modulation (including low-dose IL-2 therapy and Tregitopes) are also discussed.

Novel approaches now not only target the integrins on the lymphocyte surface, but also its endothelial ligand: MAdCAM-1. As with vedolizumab, antibodies against MAdCAM-1 appear most effective in ulcerative colitis rather than in Crohn's. Targeting chemokines or their receptors does not appear to have the same efficacy as those that target the most stable integrin: immunoglobulin superfamily interactions between the lymphocyte and endothelium.

The goal of this study was to determine whether contrast extravasation on multisection CT angiography (CTA) and/or contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the brain is associated with hematoma expansion and increased mortality in patients with primary ICH.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with primary ICH who underwent CTA and CECT, as well as follow-up noncontrast CT (NCCT) before discharge/death from January 1, 2003, to September 30, 2005, were retrospectively identified. One neuroradiologist reviewed admission and follow-up NCCT for hematoma size and growth. A second neuroradiologist independently reviewed CTA and CECT for active contrast extravasation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the significance of clinical and radiologic variables in predicting 30-day mortality, designated as the primary outcome. Hematoma growth was considered as a secondary outcome.RESULTS: Of 56 patients, contrast extravasation was seen in 17.9% of patients on initial CTA and in 23.2% of patients on initial CECT following CTA. Univariate analysis showed that the presence of extravasation on CT, large initial hematoma size (>30 mL), the presence of \"swirl sign\" on NCCT, the Glasgow Coma Scale and ICH scores, and international normalized ratio were associated with increased mortality. On multivariate analysis, only contrast extravasation on CT (P = .017) independently predicted mortality.

Here we analyze and study the evolutionary properties of a new type of noncoding marker, conserved nonexonic elements (CNEEs), which consists of noncoding elements that are estimated to evolve slower than the neutral rate across a set of species. Although they often include UCEs, CNEEs are distinct from UCEs because they are not ultraconserved, and, most importantly, the core region alone is analyzed, rather than both the core and its flanking regions. Using a data set of 16 birds plus an alligator outgroup, and ∼3600-∼3800 loci per marker type, we found that although CNEEs were less variable than bioinformatically derived UCEs or introns and in some cases exhibited a slower approach to branch resolution as determined by phylogenomic subsampling, the quality of CNEE alignments was superior to those of the other markers, with fewer gaps and missing species. Phylogenetic resolution using coalescent approaches was comparable among the three marker types, with most nodes being fully and congruently resolved. Comparison of phylogenetic results across the three marker types indicated that one branch, the sister group to the passerine + falcon clade, was resolved differently and with moderate (>70%) bootstrap support between CNEEs and UCEs or introns.

Also, consistent with previous work, more genes that bind Abf1 are unaffected by loss of binding than those that bind Rap1.

That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators, insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General Regulatory Factors (GRFs).

Human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a mixture of polyclonal IgG antibodies isolated and pooled from thousands of healthy human donors. The scientific rationale for testing IVIG as a potential AD treatment include its natural anti-Aβ antibody activity, its favorable safety profile and inherent anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory properties. Over the past decade, several clinical and pre-clinical experimental findings, advanced our knowledge about biological and therapeutic properties of IVIG that are relevant to AD therapy. Anti-amyloid antibodies in IVIG show significantly higher binding avidity for amyloid oligomers and fibrils than for Aβ monomers. In a double transgenic murine model of AD, intracerebral injection of IVIG causes suppression of Aβ fibril pathology whereas long term peripheral IVIG treatments causes elevation of total brain Aβ levels with no measurable impact on Aβ deposits or tendency for inducing cerebral microhemmorhage. Furthermore, chronic IVIG treatment suppressed neuroinflammation and fostered adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In clinical studies with AD patients, IVIG showed an acceptable safety profile and has not been reported to increase the incidence of amyloid related imaging abnormalities. Preliminary studies on small number of patients reported clinical benefits in mild to moderate stage AD patients. However, double blind, placebo controlled studies later did not replicate those initial findings. Interestingly though, in APOE4 carriers and in moderate disease stage subgroups, positive cognitive signals were reported. Nevertheless, both clinical and experimental (mouse) studies show that antibodies in IVIG can accumulate in CNS and its biological activities include neutralization of Aβ oligomers, suppression of neuroinflammation and immunomodulation. Identifying mediators of IVIG's effects at the cellular and molecular level is warranted.

In this method, transcriptional repression by the 'Tet-OFF' promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target protein by the AID system. To provide examples, we describe the construction of tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and auxin.

The patient had undergone parotidectomy 5 years before presentation with this intracranial lesion. On magnetic resonance imaging, the lesion was separate from the pineal gland and displaced the internal cerebral veins downward. Ventricular obstruction and increased cellularity were also suggested, and multiple fluid-filled cystic spaces were observed. The tumor was partially resected, because the extreme lateral boundary could not be visualized. Histological analysis with anti-c-kit antibody showed strong expression of the epithelial component; immunohistochemistry with anti-p63 antibody revealed nests of positive tumor cells, highlighting the myoepithelial component. The tumor also stained positive for anti-Myb antibody.CONCLUSIONS: The treatment for this lesion is surgical debulking followed by radiation therapy; however, the overall prognosis remains grim because of limited chemotherapy options and a propensity for recurrence in both local and distant fashions.

Complex sSMC consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome; the best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 {der(22)t(11;22)} or Emanuel syndrome. In 2008 we speculated that complex sSMC could be part of an underestimated entity.RESULTS: Here, the overall yet reported 412 complex sSMC are summarized. They constitute 8.4% of all yet in detail characterized sSMC cases. The majority of the complex sSMC is contributed by patients suffering from Emanuel syndrome (82%). Besides there are a der(22)t(8;22)(q24.1;q11.1) and a der(13)t(13;18)(q11;p11.21) or der(21)t(18;21)(p11.21;q11.1) = der(13 or 21)t(13 or 21;18) syndrome. The latter two represent another 2.6% and 2.2% of the complex sSMC-cases, respectively. The large majority of complex sSMC has a centric minute shape and derives from an acrocentric chromosome. Nonetheless, complex sSMC can involve material from each chromosomal origin. Most complex sSMC are inherited form a balanced translocation in one parent and are non-mosaic. Interestingly, there are hot spots for the chromosomal breakpoints involved.CONCLUSIONS: Complex sSMC need to be considered in diagnostics, especially in non-mosaic, centric minute shaped sSMC. As yet three complex-sSMC-associated syndromes are identified. As recurrent breakpoints in the complex sSMC were characterized, it is to be expected that more syndromes are identified in this subgroup of sSMC.

It may also provide explanations as to how quantitative differences in gene expression determine phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility among natural populations.

We enrolled eligible patients aged 18-75 years with a documented history of ileal, colonic, or ileocolonic Crohn's disease for 3 months or more before screening, as assessed by colonoscopy and supported by histology, and a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score during screening between 220 and 450 inclusive. Patients were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive filgotinib 200 mg once a day or placebo for 10 weeks. Patients were stratified according to previous anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha exposure, C-reactive protein concentration at screening (≤10 mg/L or >10 mg/L), and oral corticosteroid use at baseline, using an interactive web-based response system. The primary endpoint was clinical remission, defined as CDAI less than 150 at week 10.

We suggest a possible classification of mitochondrial diseases according to the kind of mt DNA mutations: structural mitochondrial gene mutation as in LHON (Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy) and NARP (Neurogenic muscle weakness, Ataxia and Retinitis Pigmentosa) as well as some cases of Leigh's syndrome; transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA mitochondrial gene mutation as in MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Strokelike Episodes) or MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers) or deafness with aminoglycoside; structural with transfer RNA mitochondrial gene mutations as observed in large-scale deletions or duplications in Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson's syndrome, diabetes mellitus with deafness, and CPEO (Chronic Progressive External Ophtalmoplegia). Depletions of the mt DNA may also be classified in this category. Even though mutations are generally maternally inherited, most of the deletions are sporadic. However, multiple deletions or depletions may be transmitted in a mendelan trait which suggests that nuclear gene products play a primary role in these processes. The relationship between a mutation and a particular phenotype is far from being fully understood. Gene dosage and energic threshold, which are tissue-specific, appear to be the best indicators. However, the recessive or dominant behavior of both the wild type or the mutated genome appears to play a significant role, which can be verified with in vitro studies."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "eber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) ", "answer_start": 29}], "question": "What is LHON, also known as Lebers syndrome?", "id": "5a74d9980384be9551000008_021", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) have been found to occur in combination.

When following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms. In Graeco-Roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease, but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body. Especially in the Corpus Hippocraticum dating from the 5th and 4th century B. C. this materialistic and at the same time psychosomatic attitude can be noticed. Aristotle (4th century B. C.), Celsus (1st century A. D.), and the famous experimental physiologist Galen (2nd century A. D.) agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without exception. It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor). He also coined the term [see text] to characterize an attack of migraine. In algotherapy, Galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology. On the other hand, pain was designed as a multi-dimensional symbol by the famous Graeco-Roman epic poets. In Homer's Odyssey (8th century B.

Specific diagnostic and procedural codes were used to identify cases of IHPS.RESULTS: A total of 2466 of 1 074 236 children in the study period developed IHPS. Azithromycin exposure in the first 14 days of life demonstrated an increased risk of IHPS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.62-26.0); exposure between 15 and 42 days had an aOR of 2.98 (95% CI, 1.24-7.20). An association between erythromycin and IHPS was also confirmed. Exposure to erythromycin in the first 14 days of life had an aOR of 13.3 (95% CI, 6.80-25.9), and 15 to 42 days of life, aOR 4.10 (95% CI, 1.69-9.91). There was no association with either macrolide between 43 and 90 days of life.CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of oral azithromycin and erythromycin places young infants at increased risk of developing IHPS.

Recent evidence indicates that circRNAs play important roles in tissue development, gene regulation, and carcinogenesis. However, whether circRNAs encode functional proteins remains elusive, although translation of several circRNAs was recently reported.Methods: CircRNA deep sequencing was performed by using 10 pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma samples and their paired adjacent normal brain tissues. Northern blotting, Sanger sequencing, antibody, and liquid chromatograph Tandem Mass Spectrometer were used to confirm the existence of circ-FBXW7 and its encoded protein in in two cell lines. Lentivirus-transfected stable U251 and U373 cells were used to assess the biological functions of the novel protein invitro and invivo (five mice per group). Clinical implications of circ-FBXW7 were assessed in 38 pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma samples and their paired periphery normal brain tissues by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (two-sided log-rank test).Results: Circ-FBXW7 is abundantly expressed in the normal human brain (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads [RPKM] = 9.31). The spanning junction open reading frame in circ-FBXW7 driven by internal ribosome entry site encodes a novel 21-kDa protein, which we termed FBXW7-185aa. Upregulation of FBXW7-185aa in cancer cells inhibited proliferation and cell cycle acceleration, while knockdown of FBXW7-185aa promoted malignant phenotypes invitro and invivo. FBXW7-185aa reduced the half-life of c-Myc by antagonizing USP28-induced c-Myc stabilization. Moreover, circ-FBXW7 and FBXW7-185aa levels were reduced in glioblastoma clinical samples compared with their paired tumor-adjacent tissues (P < .001). Circ-FBXW7 expression positively associated with glioblastoma patient overall survival (P = .03).Conclusions: Endogenous circRNA encodes a functional protein in human cells, and circ-FBXW7 and FBXW7-185aa have potential prognostic implications in brain cancer.© The Author 2017.

How could this happen in higher organisms whose populations are small compared to those of microbes, and in which chances of combined nearly simultaneous highly specific favorable mutations are correspondingly low? The question can in principle be answered for regulatory evolution, one of the basic processes of evolutionary change. A combined resetting of transcription rates in several genes could occur in the same individual. It is proposed that, in eukaryotes, changes in epigenetic trends and epigenetically transforming encounters between alternative chromatin structures could arise frequently enough so as to render probable particular conjunctions of changed transcription rates. Such conjunctions could involve mutational changes with low specificity requirements in gene-associated regions of non-protein-coding sequences. The effects of such mutations, notably when they determine the use of histone variants and covalent modifications of histones, can be among those that migrate along chromatin. Changes in chromatin structure are often cellularly inheritable over at least a limited number of generations of cells, and of individuals when the germ line is involved. SINEs and LINEs, which have been considered \"junk DNA\", are among the repeat sequences that would appear liable to have teleregulatory effects on the function of a nearby promoter, through changes in their numbers and distribution. There may also be present preexisting unstably inheritable epigenetic trends leading to cellular variegation, trends endemic in a cell population based on DNA sequences previously established in the neighborhood. Either way, epigenetically conditioned teleregulatory trends may display only limited penetrance. The imposition at a distance of new chromatin structures with regulatory impact can occur in cis as well as in trans, and is examined as intrachromosomally spreading teleregulation and interchromosomal \"gene kissing\". The chances for two or more particular epigenetically determined regulatory trends to occur together in a cell are increased thanks to the proposed low specificity requirements for most of the pertinent sequence changes in intergenic and intronic DNA or in the distribution of middle repetitive sequences that have teleregulatory impact. Inheritable epigenetic changes (\"epimutations\") with effects at a distance would then perdure over the number of generations required for \"assimilation\" of the several regulatory novelties through the occurrence and selection, gene by gene, of specific classical mutations. These mutations would have effects similar to the epigenetic effects, yet would provide stability and penetrance. The described epigenetic/genetic partnership may well at times have opened the way toward certain complex new functions. Thus, the presence of \"junk DNA\", through co-determining the (higher or lower) order and the variants of chromatin structure with regulatory effects at a distance, might make an important contribution to the evolution of complex organisms."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Instances of 2 different alleles touching each other were found in 20-47% of nuclei depending on the tissue.

Our recent study demonstrated that genes with the same zip codes cluster together at the nuclear periphery. The zip codes were necessary and sufficient to induce interchromosomal clustering. Finally, we identified a transcription factor (Put3) that binds to the GRS I zip code. Put3 binds to GRS I and is required for both GRS I-dependent positioning at the nuclear periphery and interchromosomal clustering of GRS I-targeted genes. We speculate that our findings might provide insight into other types of gene kissing, some of which also require cis-acting DNA sequences and trans-acting proteins."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "ibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant disease associated with mutations in the fibrinogen A alpha chain (FGA) gene, and it is the most common cause of hereditary renal amyloidosis in the UK", "answer_start": 15}], "question": "What protein is the most common cause of hereditary  renal amyloidosis?", "id": "5a6a02a3b750ff4455000021_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Introduction: Fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant disease associated with mutations in the fibrinogen A alpha chain (FGA) gene, and it is the most common cause of hereditary renal amyloidosis in the UK. Patients typically present with kidney impairment and progress to end-stage renal disease over a median time of 4.6 years.Methods: Six patients presented with proteinuria, hypertension, and/or lower limb edema and underwent detailed clinical and laboratory investigations.Results: A novel FGA gene mutation was identified in each case: 2 frameshift mutations F521Sfs*27 and G519Efs*30 and 4 single base substitutions G555F, E526K, E524K, R554H. In 5 subjects, extensive amyloid deposits were found solely within the glomeruli, which stained specifically with antibodies to fibrinogen A alpha chain, and in one of these cases, we found coexistent fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease. One patient was diagnosed with light-chain amyloidosis after a bone marrow examination revealed a small clonal plasma cell population, and laser microdissection of the amyloid deposits followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry identified kappa light chain as the fibril protein.Discussion: We report 6 novel mutations in the FGA gene: 5 were associated with renal fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis and 1 was found to be incidental to light-chain amyloid deposits discovered in a patient with a plasma cell dyscrasia. Clinical awareness and suspicion of hereditary amyloidosis corroborated by genetic analysis and adequate typing using combined immunohistochemistry and laser microdissection and mass spectrometry is valuable to avoid misdiagnosis, especially when a family history of amyloidosis is absent."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Hereditary renal amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant condition with considerable overlap with other amyloidosis type", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What protein is the most common cause of hereditary  renal amyloidosis?", "id": "5a6a02a3b750ff4455000021_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Hereditary renal amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant condition with considerable overlap with other amyloidosis types.

Renal transplantation resulted in rapid destruction of the allograft by amyloid deposition within 2 years. Amyloid fibril protein isolated from a transplanted kidney was found to contain a novel, hybrid peptide of 49 residues whose N-terminal 23 amino acids were identical to residues 499 to 521 of normal fibrinogen Aalpha-chain. The remainder of the peptide (26 residues) represented a completely new sequence for mammalian proteins. DNA sequencing documented that the new sequence was the result of a single nucleotide deletion at position 4897 of the fibrinogen Aalpha-chain gene that gives a frame-shift at codon 522 and premature termination at codon 548. The contributions toward fibrillogenesis of the two portions of the amyloid fibril protein, ie, N-terminal fibrinogen sequence and C-terminal novel sequence, are presently unknown.

In two affected living members, we identified the AFib R554L mutation. Renal biopsies from two affected members revealed almost complete obliteration of the mesangial glomerular architecture, although kidney function was only moderately impaired. There was neither evidence of extrarenal amyloidosis nor accelerated atherosclerosis.CONCLUSIONS: Renal amyloidosis associated with the R554L AFib variant dominated the clinical picture in this family, which was similar to that associated with the much more prevalent E526V mutation. Although it has been hypothesized that vascular deposits of fibrinogen amyloid may be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, there was no suggestion of this in this particular kindred."}]}]}
