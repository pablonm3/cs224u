The interaction of the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA-L) gene and early childhood adversity has been shown to predict aggression in clinical and non-clinical populations. Although impulsivity is a risk factor for aggression in BPD and ASPD, little research has investigated potential gene-environment (G×E) influences impacting its expression in these conditions. Moreover, G×E interactions may differ by diagnosis.Methods: Full factorial analysis of variance was employed to investigate the influence of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) genotype, childhood abuse, and diagnosis on Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) scores in 61 individuals: 20 subjects with BPD, 18 subjects with ASPD, and 23 healthy controls.Results: A group×genotype×abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018), such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11 motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11 attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025).Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD.

Interestingly, multiple HDAC-associated proteins were also enriched by SAHA-BPyne, even after denaturation of probe-labeled proteomes. These data indicate that certain HDAC-associated proteins are directly modified by SAHA-BPyne, placing them in close proximity to HDAC active sites where they would be primed to regulate substrate recognition and activity. We further show that SAHA-BPyne can be used to measure differences in HDAC content and complex assembly in human disease models.

HDACs are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues within histones, as well as a range of other proteins including transcriptional factors. HDACs are highly conserved proteins divided into two families and based on sequence similarity in four classes.

These proteins possess certain features present in the conserved catalytic domains of class I human HDACs, but also contain additional sequence domains. Interestingly, HDAC6 contains an internal duplication of two catalytic domains, which appear to function independently of each other. These class II HDAC proteins have differential mRNA expression in human tissues and possess in vitro HDAC activity that is inhibited by trichostatin A. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that these HDAC proteins are not components of the previously identified HDAC1 and HDAC2 NRD and mSin3A complexes.

Thus far, 11 members of the HDAC family have been identified in humans, but few have been characterized in detail. To better define the biological function of these proteins, make maximal use of studies performed in other systems, and assist in drug development efforts, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of all HDAC-related proteins in all fully sequenced free-living organisms. Previous analyses have divided non-sirtuin HDACs into two groups, classes 1 and 2. We find that HDACs can be divided into three equally distinct groups: class 1, class 2, and a third class consisting of proteins related to the recently identified human HDAC11 gene. We term this novel group \"class 4\" to distinguish it from the unrelated \"class 3\" sirtuin deacetylases. Analysis of gene duplication events indicates that the common ancestor of metazoan organisms contained two class 1, two class 2, and a single class 4 HDAC. Examination of HDAC characteristics in light of these evolutionary relationships leads to functional predictions, among them that self-association is common among HDAC proteins. All three HDAC classes (including class 4) exist in eubacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial HDAC relatives suggests that all three HDAC classes precede the evolution of histone proteins and raises the possibility that the primary activity of some \"histone deacetylase\" enzymes is directed against non-histone substrates."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Transcription is controlled in part by the dynamic acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins.

We found HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC5, and HDAC7 all to be up-regulated in the field of human CRC. Furthermore, we observed that HDAC2 up-regulation is one of the earliest events in CRC carcinogenesis and observed this in human field carcinogenesis, the azoxymethane-treated rat model, and in more aggressive colon cancer cell lines. The universality of HDAC2 up-regulation suggests that HDAC2 up-regulation is a novel and important early event in CRC, which may serve as a biomarker. HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) interfere with tumorigenic HDAC activity; however, the precise mechanisms involved in this process remain to be elucidated.

In this study, we characterized disease progression as well as alterations in immune system homeostasis, cytokine production and gene expression in rhesus macaques infected with the virulent YFV strain DakH1279 (YFV-DakH1279).

These observations suggest that additional tissue damage could be due to indirect effects of viral replication. Indeed, circulating levels of several cytokines peaked shortly before euthanasia. Our study also includes the first description of YFV-DakH1279-induced changes in gene expression within peripheral blood mononuclear cells 3 days post-infection prior to any clinical signs.

Within the PDAC tumor microenvironment, activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) are the dominant stromal cell type and responsible for collagen deposition. Lumican is a secreted proteoglycan that regulates collagen fibril assembly. We have previously identified that the presence of lumican in the ECM surrounding PDAC cells is associated with improved patient outcome after multimodal therapy and surgical removal of localized PDAC.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Lumican expression in PDAC from 27 patients was determined by IHC and quantitatively analyzed for colocalization with PSCs. In vitro studies examined the molecular mechanisms of lumican transcription and secretion from PSCs (HPSCs and HPaSteC), and cell adhesion and migration assays examined the effect of lumican on PSCs in a collagen-rich environment.RESULTS: Here we identify PSCs as a significant source of extracellular lumican production through quantitative IHC analysis. We demonstrate that the cytokine, TGF-β, negatively regulates lumican gene transcription within HPSCs through its canonical signaling pathway and binding of SMAD4 to novel SBEs identified within the promoter region. In addition, we found that the ability of HPSCs to produce and secrete extracellular lumican significantly enhances HPSCs adhesion and mobility on collagen.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that activated pancreatic stellate cells within PDAC secrete lumican under the negative control of TGF-β; once secreted, the extracellular lumican enhances stellate cell adhesion and mobility in a collagen-rich environment.

We determined the need for a novel detection method by studying the distribution of tumor cells in ovaries from patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, we examined which cell-surface proteins are suitable as a target for non-invasive tumor-specific imaging of ovarian metastases from invasive breast cancer.METHODS: Using the nationwide database of the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA), we identified a cohort of 46 women with primary invasive breast cancer and ovarian metastases. The localization and morphology of ovarian metastases were determined on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections. The following cell-surface markers were immunohistochemically analyzed: E-cadherin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), human epidermal growth receptor type 2 (Her2/neu), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), αvβ6 integrin and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM).RESULTS: The majority of ovarian metastases (71%) consisted of a solitary metastasis or multiple distinct nodules separated by uninvolved ovarian tissue, suggesting that ovarian metastases might be overlooked by the current detection approach. Combining the targets E-cadherin, EMA and Her2/neu resulted in nearly 100% detection of ductal ovarian metastases, whereas the combination of EMA, Her2/neu and EpCAM was most suitable to detect lobular ovarian metastases.CONCLUSIONS: Examination of the actual ovarian transplants is recommended.

Moreover, EpCAM has been shown to modulate trans-epithelial migration processes of white blood cells.

Tumor cells display increased EpCAM expression that often correlates with the loss of strict basolateral localization.

Liver regeneration is associated with a population of EpCAM-positive cells within ductular reactions, which gradually lose the expression of EpCAM along with maturation into hepatocytes. EpCAM can be switched on and off through a wide panel of strategies to fine-tune EpCAM-dependent functional and differentiative traits. EpCAM-associated functions relate to cell-cell adhesion, proliferation, maintenance of a pluripotent state, regulation of differentiation, migration, and invasion. These functions can be conferred by the full-length protein and/or EpCAM-derived fragments, which are generated upon regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Control by EpCAM therefore not only depends on the presence of full-length EpCAM at cellular membranes but also on varying rates of the formation of EpCAM-derived fragments that have their own regulatory properties and on changes in the association of EpCAM with interaction partners.

Apixaban is the second oral direct selective factor Xa inhibitor approved for the prevention of stroke/systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. It was significantly better than aspirin in reducing stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism without increasing the risk of major bleeding in patients with AF who were at increased risk of stroke and for whom warfarin was unsuitable. In a randomized, double-blind trial that was originally designed to test for noninferiority, apixaban was superior to warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2-3) in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, caused less bleeding, and resulted in lower mortality in patients with AF. Apixaban has a half-life of about 12 hours, and the normal dosage is 5 mg orally twice daily.

These events have hampered its use as a model of stress employing continuous pain as a stress stimulus. We describe here a new, simple method of a subcutaneous application of formalin in conscious rats without restraint and needle insertion. Formalin or physiological saline (controls) was injected subcutaneously through a chronically implanted catheter in the region of the lower leg. In most animals, the cardiovascular and behavioural responses to subcutaneously injected formalin were biphasic. The early phase was quantitatively characterized. Formalin (2.5%, 50 microL) induced a marked increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Maximal increases occurred during the first 3 min after formalin injection and were followed by a gradual decline of both cardiovascular parameters to levels higher than the preinjection baseline. Subcutaneous saline injection did not induce any changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The behavioural response to formalin featured intensive licking and biting of the injection site. The behavioural response to subcutaneous saline did not differ from the spontaneous behavioural activity recorded in noninjected rats. Subcutaneously injected formalin induced an immediate increase in plasma corticotrophin (ACTH), corticosterone, noradrenaline, and adrenaline levels, and all hormones remained increased during the whole observation period (60 min). Adrenaline and noradrenaline levels in plasma were slightly, but significantly, elevated during the initial 5 min after subcutaneous saline application but returned to basal values after 15 min. The magnitude of the hormonal responses characterizes the described formalin test as a moderate stress stimulus. The complex response pattern to formalin injected through the subcutaneous catheter is brought about exclusively by pain generated by formalin-induced tissue injury.

There is some evidence suggesting that morphine does not produce antinociception in the formalin test via the brain-stem and spinal cord circuitry normally associated with antinociception. Furthermore, morphine appears to require an intact forebrain in order to function as an analgesic for formalin pain. In the 2 experiments reported here, we investigated the possibility that the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) contributes to the production of morphine antinociception (MA) in the formalin test. Nociception in this test occurs in 2 phases, with the 1st phase occurring 0-5 min after formalin injection and the 2nd phase beginning 10-15 min after injection and continuing for approximately 1 h. In Exp. 1, bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the Ce, but not lesions of the adjacent basolateral nucleus (BL), reliably attenuated MA (7 mg/kg morphine sulfate) during the 2nd phase of the formalin test without affecting baseline nociception. These results were obtained regardless of whether the rating scale method or flinch-frequency method of nociceptive scoring was used. During the 1st phase, Ce lesions reliably attenuated MA as measured by the flinch-frequency method, but not as measured by the rating scale method. In Exp. 2, Ce lesions also reliably attenuated the antinociception produced by 12 mg/kg morphine sulfate during the 2nd phase of the formalin test. Antinociception appeared to be almost completely re-instated, however, if the dose of morphine was raised to 20 mg/kg. The results indicate that neurons originating from the Ce contribute to the production of MA during the 2nd phase, and possibly the 1st phase, of the formalin test, especially at relatively lower doses of morphine. This suggests that in addition to coordinating conditioned antinociceptive responses, the amygdala may be a component of endogenous antinociceptive circuitry. These and other issues are discussed with reference to the spino-ponto-amygdaloid nociceptive pathway, and the proposed role of the amygdala in the mediation of defense reactions."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The formalin test is increasingly applied as a model of inflammatory pain using high formalin concentrations (5-15%).

At PND 22, a concentration of 1.1% evoked higher flinching and licking responses during the late phase (10-30 min) in both males and females. During the early phase (0-5 min), 1.1% evoked higher licking responses compared to 0.9% or 1% formalin. 1.1% formalin produced a biphasic response that was not evident with 0.9 or 1%. At PND 82, rats displayed a biphasic pattern in response to three formalin concentrations (1.25%, 1.75% and 2.25%) with the presence of an interphase for both 1.75% and 2.25% but not for 1.25%.

A 76-year-old man with a history of cerebral infarction had been taking antiplatelet agents for one year.

Neurological examination revealed flaccid paralysis of both lower extremities with negative Babinski's reflex, and sensory disturbance below the level of L1. The bleeding time and prothrombin time were prolonged. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a biconvex, relatively hyperdense mass in the posterior spinal canal at the level of T12. Metrizamide myelography disclosed an incomplete blockage caused by an epidural mass at the level of T11. Post-myelographic CT scan demonstrated a sharply demarcated extradural filling defect at the level of T11. Seventeen hours after the onset of symptoms, an emergency laminectomy was performed extending from T12 to L3, and the epidural clot was totally evacuated. Histological examination of the capsule of the hematoma revealed no vascular anomalies. The patient made a good postoperative recovery. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous intraspinal hemorrhage in a patient taking antiplatelet drugs. Acute onset of persistent pain anywhere along the spinal axis and the development of spinal neurological deficits in a patient on antiplatelet therapy should raise the suspicion of a spinal epidural hematoma.

It is a rare and usually severe neurological disorder that, without adequate treatment, often leads to death or permanent neurological deficit. Epidural as well as subdural and subarachnoid hematomas have been investigated. Some cases of subarachnoid spinal hematoma may present with symptoms similar to those of cerebral hemorrhage. The literature offers no reliable estimates of the incidence of spinal hematoma, perhaps due to the rarity of this disorder. In the present work, 613 case studies published between 1826 and 1996 have been evaluated, which represents the largest review on this topic to date. Most cases of spinal hematoma have a multifactorial etiology whose individual components are not all understood in detail. In up to a third of cases (29.7%) of spinal hematoma, no etiological factor can be identified as the cause of the bleeding. Following idiopathic spinal hematoma, cases related to anticoagulant therapy and vascular malformations represent the second and third most common categories. Spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures in combination with anticoagulant therapy represent the fifth most common etiological group and spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures alone represent the tenth most common cause of spinal hematoma. Anticoagulant therapy alone probably does not trigger spinal hemorrhage. It is likely that there must additionally be a \"locus minoris resistentiae\" together with increased pressure in the interior vertebral venous plexus in order to cause spinal hemorrhage. The latter two factors are thought to be sufficient to cause spontaneous spinal hematoma. Physicians should require strict indications for the use of spinal anesthetic procedures in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy, even if the incidence of spinal hematoma following this combination is low. If spinal anesthetic procedures are performed before, during, or after anticoagulant treatment, close monitoring of the neurological status of the patient is warranted. Time limits regarding the use of anticoagulant therapy before or after spinal anesthetic procedures have been proposed and are thought to be safe for patients. Investigation of the coagulation status alone does not necessarily provide an accurate estimate of the risk of hemorrhage. The most important measure for recognizing patients at high risk is a thorough clinical history. Most spinal hematomas are localized dorsally to the spinal cord at the level of the cervicothoracic and thoracolumbar regions. Subarachnoid hematomas can extend along the entire length of the subarachnoid space. Epidural and subdural spinal hematoma present with intense, knife-like pain at the location of the hemorrhage (\"coup de poignard\") that may be followed in some cases by a pain-free interval of minutes to days, after which there is progressive paralysis below the affected spinal level. Subarachnoid hematoma can be associated with meningitis symptoms, disturbances of consciousness, and epileptic seizures and is often misdiagnosed as cerebral hemorrhage based on these symptoms. Most patients are between 55 and 70 years old. Of all patients with spinal hemorrhage, 63.9% are men. The examination of first choice is magnetic resonance imaging. The treatment of choice is surgical decompression. Of the patients investigated in the present work, 39.6% experienced complete recovery. The less severe the preoperative symptoms are and the more quickly surgical decompression can be performed, the better are the chances for complete recovery. It is therefore essential to recognize the relatively typical clinical presentation of spinal hematoma in a timely manner to allow correct diagnostic and therapeutic measures to be taken to maximize the patient's chance of complete recovery."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We report the case of a man of 65 who, at 20 and 37 days from surgery of C6 corpectomy, experienced two epidural hematomas at C7-D1.

In cell model studies of HD, we have found that truncated N-terminal portions of huntingtin (the HD gene product) with expanded repeats form more aggregates than longer or full length huntingtin polypeptides. These shorter fragments are also more prone to aggregate in the nucleus and cause more cell toxicity. Further experiments with huntingtin constructs harbouring exogenous nuclear import and nuclear export signals have implicated the nucleus in direct cell toxicity. We have made mouse models of HD and DRPLA using an N-terminal truncation of huntingtin (N171) and full-length atrophin-1 (the DRPLA gene product), respectively. In both models, diffuse neuronal nuclear staining and nuclear inclusion bodies are observed in animals expressing the expanded glutamine repeat protein, further implicating the nucleus as a primary site of neuronal dysfunction. Neuritic pathology is also observed in the HD mice. In the DRPLA mouse model, we have found that truncated fragments of atrophin-1 containing the glutamine repeat accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that proteolysis may be critical for disease progression.

Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either CLCa or CLCb inhibits the uptake of GPCRs. Moreover, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser204 in CLCb is required for efficient endocytosis of a subset of GPCRs and identify G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a kinase that can phosphorylate CLCb on Ser204. Overexpression of CLCb(S204A) specifically inhibits the endocytosis of those GPCRs whose endocytosis is GRK2-dependent.CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results indicate that CLCb phosphorylation acts as a discriminator for the endocytosis of specific GPCRs.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Results of the SANS measurements are consistent with the light scattering measurements, but show a shoulder in the scattering function at intermediate q values (0.016 A(-1)), just beyond the Guinier regime. This feature can be accounted for by Brownian dynamics simulations based on flexible bead-spring models of a triskelion, which generate time-averaged scattering functions.

The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by this gene exhibited 69 and 67% identity with the sequences of the ABC transporters encoded by the exsA genes of Rhizobium meliloti and Mesorhizobium loti, respectively. Additionally, B. abortus ExsA, like R. meliloti and M. loti ExsA, possesses ATP-binding motifs and the ABC signature domain features of a typical ABC transporter. Furthermore, ortholog group analysis placed B. abortus ExsA in ortholog group 6 of ABC transporters more likely to be involved in bacterial pathogenesis. In R. meliloti, ExsA is an exopolysaccharide transporter essential for alfalfa root nodule invasion and establishment of infection. To test the role of ExsA in Brucella pathogenesis, an exsA deletion mutant was constructed. Replacement of the wild-type exsA by recombination was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis of Brucella genomic DNA. Decreased survival in mice of the Brucella DeltaexsA mutant compared to the survival of parental strain S2308 demonstrated that ExsA is critical for full bacterial virulence. Additionally, the B. abortus exsA deletion mutant was used as a live vaccine. Challenge experiments revealed that the exsA mutant strain induced superior protective immunity in BALB/c mice compared to the protective immunity induced by strain S19 or RB51."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Brucella abortus is a facultative, intracellular zoonotic pathogen which can cause undulant fever in humans and abortions in cattle.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Is Brucella abortus the organism that causes brucillosis known to cause spontaneous abortions in humans?", "id": "5aa6800ad6d6b54f79000011_011", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Brucella abortus is a facultative, intracellular zoonotic pathogen which can cause undulant fever in humans and abortions in cattle.

Hemagglutination inhibition experiments suggested that the 14-kDa protein has affinity towards mannose. Disruption of the gene encoding the 14-kDa protein in virulent B. abortus strain 2308 induced a rough-like phenotype with an altered smooth lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immunoblot profile and a significant reduction in the bacterium's ability to replicate in mouse spleens.

This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans.

We characterized the MC1R genotype in a panel of human melanocyte cultures and identified three cultures that were homozygous for Arg160Trp, heterozygous for Arg151Cys and Asp294His, and heterozygous for Arg160Trp and Asp294His substitutions, respectively. Those cultures failed to respond to alpha-MSH with increase in cAMP levels, tyrosinase activity, or proliferation and had an exaggerated response to the cytotoxic effect of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These loss-of-function mutations have been associated with red hair phenotype and increased risk for skin cancer. Melanocytes homozygous for Val29Met substitution in MC1R responded normally to alpha-MSH and UVB, suggesting that this variant is a polymorphism. We observed that alpha-MSH promotes human melanocyte survival by inhibiting the UV-induced apoptosis independently of melanin synthesis. This effect was absent in human melanocytes with loss of function MC1R mutations.

The synthesis of eumelanin is stimulated by the binding of alpha-melanotropin (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) to the functional melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) expressed on melanocytes. The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic and certain allelic variants of the gene are associated with red hair phenotype, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The importance of the MC1R gene in determining skin cancer risk led us to examine the impact of specific polymorphisms in this gene on the responses of human melanocytes to alpha-melanotropin and UV radiation. We compared the ability of human melanocyte cultures, each derived from a single donor, to respond to alpha-melanotropin with dose-dependent stimulation of cAMP formation, tyrosinase activity and proliferation. In each of those cultures the MC1R gene was sequenced, and the eumelanin and pheomelanin contents were determined. Human melanocytes homozygous for Arg160Trp, heterozygous for Arg160Trp and Asp294His, or for Arg151Cys and Asp294His substitutions, but not melanocytes homozygous for Val92Met substitution, in the MC1R demonstrated a significantly reduced response to alpha-melanotropin. Additionally, melanocytes with a non-functional MC1R demonstrated a pronounced increase in their sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of UV radiation compared with melanocytes expressing functional MC1R. We conclude that loss-of-function mutations in the MC1R gene sensitize human melanocytes to the DNA damaging effects of UV radiation, which may increase skin cancer risk."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Several MC1R variant alleles are associated with red hair, fair skin and increased skin cancer risk.", "answer_start": 117}], "question": "What phenotype is associated with the V60L mutation in the human MC1R gene?", "id": "5ace2d600340b9f05800000e_026", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is a G-protein coupled receptor involved in the regulation of pigmentation.

In this study, we assessed this hypothesized link in PDAC, where HEATR1 expression is downregulated significantly. HEATR1 silencing in PDAC cells increased resistance to gemcitabine and other chemotherapeutics, where this effect was associated with increased AKT kinase phosphorylation at the Thr308 regulatory site. Mechanistically, HEATR1 enhanced cell responsiveness to gemcitabine by acting as a scaffold to facilitate interactions between AKT and the protein phosphatase PP2A, thereby promoting Thr308 dephosphorylation. Consistent with these findings, treatment with the AKT inhibitor triciribine sensitized HEATR1-depleted PDAC cells to gemcitabine, suggesting that this therapeutic combination may overcome gemcitabine resistance in patients with low HEATR1 expression. Clinically, we found that HEATR1 downregulation in PDAC patients was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, poor response to tumor resection plus gemcitabine standard-of-care treatment, and shorter overall survival.

However, existing models specifically designed for regulatory sequences consider the independent evolution of individual transcription factor (TF)-binding sites, ignoring that the function and evolution of a binding site depends on its context, typically the cis-regulatory module (CRM) in which the site is located. Moreover, existing models do not account for the gene-specific roles of TF-binding sites, primarily because their roles often are not well understood. We introduce two models of regulatory sequence evolution that address some of the shortcomings of existing models and implement simulation frameworks based on them. One model simulates the evolution of an individual binding site in the context of a CRM, while the other evolves an entire CRM. Both models use a state-of-the art sequence-to-expression model to predict the effects of mutations on the regulatory output of the CRM and determine the strength of selection. We use the new framework to simulate the evolution of TF-binding sites in 37 well-studied CRMs belonging to the anterior-posterior patterning system in Drosophila embryos. We show that these simulations provide accurate fits to evolutionary data from 12 Drosophila genomes, which includes statistics of binding site conservation on relatively short evolutionary scales and site loss across larger divergence times. The new framework allows us, for the first time, to test hypotheses regarding the underlying cis-regulatory code by directly comparing the evolutionary implications of the hypothesis with the observed evolutionary dynamics of binding sites. Using this capability, we find that explicitly modeling self-cooperative DNA binding by the TF Caudal (CAD) provides significantly better fits than an otherwise identical evolutionary simulation that lacks this mechanistic aspect. This hypothesis is further supported by a statistical analysis of the distribution of intersite spacing between adjacent CAD sites. Experimental tests confirm direct homodimeric interaction between CAD molecules as well as self-cooperative DNA binding by CAD. We note that computational modeling of the D. melanogaster CRMs alone did not yield significant evidence to support CAD self-cooperativity. We thus demonstrate how specific mechanistic details encoded in CRMs can be revealed by modeling their evolution and fitting such models to multispecies data."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We summarize recent case studies and genome-wide investigations that have uncovered diverse mechanisms though which new enhancers arise", "answer_start": 325}], "question": "Are human enhancers or promoters evolving faster?", "id": "5ac3699f0340b9f058000001_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "A central goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the genetic origin of morphological novelties-i.e. anatomical structures unique to a taxonomic group.

Herein, tryptase-positive MCs were quantified in the intima and media of both unstable and stable atherosclerotic plaques in infarct-related and non-infarct-related coronary arteries.RESULTS: In the media of both acute and chronic MI patients, the number of MCs was significantly higher than in controls. This was also found when evaluating unstable and stable plaques separately. In patients with chronic MI, the number of MCs in unstable lesions was significantly higher than in stable lesions. This coincided with a significant increase in the relative number of unstable plaques in patients with chronic MI compared with control and acute MI. No differences in MC density were found between infarct-related and non-infarct-related coronary arteries in patients with MI.CONCLUSION: The presence of MCs in the media of both stable and unstable atherosclerotic coronary lesions after MI suggests that MCs may be involved in the onset of MI and, on the other hand, that MI triggers intra-plaque infiltration of MCs especially in unstable plaques, possibly increasing the risk of re-infarction.Copyright © 2016 Japanese College of Cardiology.

Moreover, we observed that the transglutaminase coagulation factor XIIIA (FXIIIA) was one of the most abundant proteins contained in the BMCMC releasates. Mast cell-deficient mice exhibited increased FXIIIA plasma and activity levels as well as reduced bleeding times, indicating that mast cells are more efficient in their ability to downregulate FXIIIA than in contributing to its amounts and functions in homeostatic conditions. We found that human chymase and mouse mast cell protease-4 (the mouse homologue of human chymase) had the ability to reduce FXIIIA levels and function via proteolytic degradation.

But as much as the immunopathological role of mast cells has been acknowledged, these cells have also aroused much controversy and confusion. By now it is clear that one explanation for the sometimes even contradictory opinions on mast cell function arise from mast cell heterogeneity. This heterogeneity can express itself as differences in histochemical, biochemical, and functional characteristics. In vitro systems provided a powerful tool for the investigation of the basic mechanisms for mast cell development and differentiation and helped to demonstrate that mast cell heterogeneity can be traced back to certain cytokine patterns that are present in different microenvironments. In this context it has also been shown that the growth factors required for human mast cell differentiation are somewhat different than those for rodents. In rodents, the atypical, T cell-dependent mucosal type mast cell can be distinguished from the T cell-independent connective tissue-type mast cell. In humans, the strict classification into mucosal and connective tissue-type mast cells is not possible and the content of mast cell-specific proteases chymase and tryptase is the main criterion for mast cell subtypes in humans. The large quantities of tryptase and chymase that are synthesized by mast cells suggest and emphasize the significance of these proteinases in mast cell function and stimulated investigations about the biological properties of these mast cell-specific proteases. Comparing their biological activities it becomes clear that they share some activities.

The functional roles of mast cell in vivo have been principally characterized by comparing the biological responses in mast cell-deficient mice (WBB6F(1)-W/W(v)), their normal wild-type littermates (WBB6F(1)-+/+) and mast cell deficient mice reconstituted locally or systemically with mast cells cultured from the bone marrow cells of WBB6F(1)-+/+ mice (WBB6F(1)-W/W(v)+MC).

It has previously been suggested that after IgE-mediated degranulation mast cells can undergo regranulation. Such a process is probably of great importance with respect to the severity and perpetuation of the allergic response.OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate whether mast cells recover from degranulation and whether they still have the potential to release a granule-associated mediator and upregulate certain cytokine genes.METHODS: Mouse mast cells were repeatedly activated by IgE and specific antigen with a 24-hour or 48-hour interval. During each of the 2 activation stages, release of beta-hexosaminidase was measured by means of enzymatic colorimetric analysis, and IL-13 and IL-6 mRNA was detected by ribonuclease protection assay. Both scanning electron microscopy and time-lapse photography were used to reveal the process of mast cell recovery.RESULTS: We found that re-activation of degranulated mast cells in response to high-affinity IgE-receptor cross-linkage triggers beta-hexosaminidase release and upregulation of IL-13 and IL-6 gene expression levels similar to what is seen in the initial activation. Scanning electron microscopy documented cells at various stages during the recovery process 30 minutes after the activation. With time-lapse photography, a single cell that had undergone degranulation could be visualized consecutively during its recovery process.CONCLUSION: Mast cells can recover after an IgE-mediated activation and can repeatedly release beta-hexosaminidase and express IL-6 and IL-13 mRNA after re-activation."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Several chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with increased mast cell numbers and upregulation of the TNF receptor family member CD30, but the role of elevated CD30 expression is poorly understood.", "answer_start": 149}], "question": "What biologic process in the body is associated with Mast cells?", "id": "5aac543bfcf4565872000004_018", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Mast cells are involved in many disorders where the triggering mechanism that leads to degranulation and/or cytokine secretion has not been defined.

Here we report what we believe to be a novel way to activate mast cells with CD30 that leads to degranulation-independent secretion of chemokines. CD30 induced a de novo synthesis and secretion of the chemokines IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-1beta, a process involving the MAPK/ERK pathway. Mast cells were found to be the predominant CD30 ligand-positive (CD30L-positive) cell in the chronic inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and both CD30 and CD30L expression were upregulated in lesional skin in these conditions. Furthermore, the number of IL-8-positive mast cells was elevated both in psoriatic and atopic dermatitis lesional skin as well as in ex vivo CD30-treated healthy skin organ cultures. In summary, characterization of CD30 activation of mast cells has uncovered an IgE-independent pathway that is of importance in understanding the entirety of the role of mast cells in diseases associated with mast cells and CD30 expression.

Whereas the sun protection factor (SPF) provides an index of protection against erythemally effective solar UV, largely confined to the UVB (290-320 nm) and short-wavelength UVA (320-340 nm) region, there is currently no agreed-upon method to measure broad-spectrum protection against long-wavelength UVA (340-400 nm).OBJECTIVE: The objective of these studies was to assess the potential of in vitro UV substrate spectrophotometry and subsequent calculation of the \"critical wavelength\" value as a measure of broad-spectrum UV protection and as a routine, practical procedure for classification of sunscreen products.METHODS: The spectral absorption of 59 commercially available sunscreen products and multiple experimental formulas with one or more UV filters was measured. Sunscreen product, 1 mg/cm(2), was applied to a hydrated synthetic collagen substrate, preirradiated with a solar simulator, and then subjected to UV substrate spectrophotometry. Multiple determinations from 5 independent samples per product were used to calculate the critical wavelength value, defined as the wavelength at which the integral of the spectral absorbance curve reached 90% of the integral from 290 to 400 nm.RESULTS: We found that a recognized long-wave UVA active ingredient such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, or avobenzone is a necessary but insufficient product requirement for achieving the highest proposed broad-spectrum classification, that is, critical wavelength of 370 nm or more. Although SPF and critical wavelength are largely independent of each other, UVA absorbance must increase commensurate with SPF to maintain the same critical wavelength value. Substrate spectrophotometry and the calculation of critical wavelength can readily account for sunscreen photostability by UV preirradiation. Finally, there is also a strong positive relationship between critical wavelength and a currently available in vivo measure of UVA protection.CONCLUSION: Determination of critical wavelength by means of UV substrate spectrophotometry provides a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable measure of broad-spectrum protection, which is largely independent of SPF, yet ensures long-wavelength UVA protection commensurate with SPF.

Evidences abounds that atrial fibrillation has an extremely strong association with nutritional/oxidative status of myocardium. This arrhythmia seemingly may stem from the electrophysiological differences taking place in the boundary areas. To validate such assumptions we have surveyed widely accepted theories based on clinical and experimental evidence. There was an attempt to integrate some well-known theoretical explanations (focal, multifocal, ectopic, reentrant activity, atrial remodeling, etc.) into a new conceptually systematized arrhythmogenesis. Confronting ischemic and non-ischemic atrial zones electrophysiologically on their borderlines presumably creates a substrate vulnerable to the development of atrial fibrillation. The behavior of these interrelated areas is likely ischemia-dependent; the separating borderline(s) may be treated as conflictogenic, releasing triggers/drivers to commence and to perpetuate the arrhythmia. Ischemically damaged and non-damaged myocardial areas likely participate in the relay-race carousel of arrhythmogenicity due to their mutual interactions, accompanied by the \"fireworks\" at the separating borderlines. It could be concluded that myocardial ischemia as a nonspecific proarrhythmic factor presumably plays a key role in the genesis and sustenance of atrial fibrillation.

On the other hand, atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia in adult population [1, 2]. According to some of the large epidemiological studies diabetes mellitus is among independent risk factors for development and persistence of atrial fibrillation [3]. Both diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation independently increase the risk of thromboembolism, especially of stroke [3-5]. It is obvious that rhythm control, i.e. restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, may be essential for prevention of thromboembolism in these patients.THE AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of diabetes mellitus on rhythm control in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.METHODS: We analysed the impact of diabetes mellitus and other clinical and echocardiographic parameters (age, gender, current arrhythmia duration, presence of previous episodes of persistent atrial fibrillation, cardiac and/or noncardiac diseases, left atrial diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction) on outcome of attempted cardioversion in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation admitted to Cardiologic Department of the Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, between January 1992 and December 1999. We also analysed retrospectively the impact of diabetes mellitus and other parameters listed above on the presence of previous episodes of atrial fibrillation in our patients, that at our opinion reflected the possibilities of sinus rhythm maintenance in these patients. All continuous parameters were expressed as mean value and standard deviation. Statistical significance of differences between variables was examined using Chi-square test. For identification of independent predictors of examined outcomes we used multiple logistic regression model with 95% of confidence interval. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) programme.RESULTS: Of 378 patients with currently persistent atrial fibrillation, aged mean 53.98 +/- 11.69 years, there were 266 (70.4%) men. Diabetes mellitus was previously diagnosed in 27 (7.1%) patients, cardiac diseases in 223 (59.0%), noncardiac diseases in 47 (12.4%) and 140 (37.0%) patients had \"lone\" atrial fibrillation. Left atrial enlargement was noted in 224 (59.3%) patients, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in 82 (21.7%). Atrial fibrillation lasted 48 hours to 9 years, mean 8.5 +/- 18.14 months before cardioversion. While 43 patients had previous episodes of persistent AF for last 1-30 years, mean 10.5 +/- 7.3,335 patients never experienced AF before. There was a statistically significant difference in percent of diabetic patients (18.6%/43 vs. 5.7%/335, value of Chi-square test = 7.759, p < 0.01) in these two groups. We analysed the impact of diabetes mellitus on outcome of attempted cardioversion and on presence of previous episodes of AF reflecting the success in maintaining sinus rhythm. Multiple logistic regression models for all of 378 patients, with dependent variable being present in previous recurrent atrial fibrillations and independent variables of clinical and echocardiographic parameters as listed, identified diabetes mellitus to be an independent predictor of repeated atrial fibrillations with relative risk of 4.6 (CI 95%). When dependent variable in the same model was outcome of cardioversion (sinus rhythm is restored in 281/378 patients--74%) diabetes mellitus was not among independent predictors of successful cardioversion.DISCUSSION: The relationship between atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus is not completely understood, including the impact of known complications of diabetes mellitus on electrophysiological properties of atrial myocardium and development of atrial fibrillation [6]. Besides being the independent risk factor for occurrence of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, according to our results, appears to influence the possibilities of maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of permanent atrial fibrillation in diabetic patients. We found that patients with diabetes mellitus and persistent atrial fibrillation may be successfully converted to sinus rhythm like any other group of patients, but the presence of diabetes mellitus increases the risk of arrhythmia recurrence for 4.6 times compared to patients without diabetes mellitus. Obviously, diabetic patients need to be treated with more efficacious antiarrhythmics from the very beginning, including amiodarone, which successfully prevents recurrent atrial fibrillation in the majority of patients [7, 8].CONCLUSION: We concluded that diabetes mellitus independently predicts the presence of recurrent atrial fibrillation but does not influence the possibility of sinus rhythm restoration. The relationship between atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus needs further investigation."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "isk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease.

As a transcription factor, p53 mainly exerts its tumor suppressive function through transcriptional regulation of many target genes. To maintain the proper function of p53, p53 protein level and activity are exquisitely controlled by a group of positive and negative regulators in cells. Thus, p53, its regulators, and regulated genes form a complicated p53 signaling network. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of endogenous small non-coding RNA molecules. miRNAs play an important role in regulation of gene expression by blocking translational protein synthesis and/or degrading target mRNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated that p53 and its network are regulated by miRNAs at multiple levels. Some miRNAs regulate the level and function of p53 through directly targeting p53, whereas some other miRNAs target regulators of p53, such as MDM2 and MDM4, to indirectly regulate the activity and function of p53. On the other hand, p53 also regulates the transcriptional expression and the biogenesis of a group of miRNAs, which contributes to the tumor suppressive function of p53. p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. Many tumor-associated mutant p53, which have \"gain-of-function\" activities in tumorigenesis independently of wild type p53, can regulate the expression of different miRNAs and modulate the biogenesis of specific miRNAs to promote tumorigenesis.

Whether damage occurs spontaneously as a byproduct of normal metabolic processes, or after exposure to exogenous agents, cells muster a coordinated, complex DNA damage response (DDR) to mitigate potential harmful effects. A variety of activities are involved to promote cell survival, and include DNA repair, DNA damage tolerance, as well as transient cell cycle arrest to provide time for repair before entry into critical cell cycle phases, an event that could be lethal if traversal occurs while damage is present. When such damage is prolonged or not repairable, senescence, apoptosis or autophagy is induced. One major level of DDR regulation occurs via the orchestrated transcriptional control of select sets of genes encoding proteins that mediate the response. p53 is a transcription factor that transactivates specific DDR downstream genes through binding DNA consensus sequences usually in or near target gene promoter regions. The profile of p53-regulated genes activated at any given time varies, and is dependent upon type of DNA damage or stress experienced, exact composition of the consensus DNA binding sequence, presence of other DNA binding proteins, as well as cell context. RAD9 is another protein critical for the response of cells to DNA damage, and can also selectively regulate gene transcription. The limited studies addressing the role of RAD9 in transcription regulation indicate that the protein transactivates at least one of its target genes, p21/waf1/cip1, by binding to DNA sequences demonstrated to be a p53 response element. NEIL1 is also regulated by RAD9 through a similar DNA sequence, though not yet directly verified as a bonafide p53 response element. These findings suggest a novel pathway whereby p53 and RAD9 control the DDR through a shared mechanism involving an overlapping network of downstream target genes.

In Panama, Leishmania parasites are endemic, causing thousands of new cases every year, mostly of the cutaneous form. In the last years, the burden of the disease has increased, coincident with increasing disturbances in its natural sylvatic environments. The study of genetic variation in parasites is important for a better understanding of the biology, population genetics, and ultimately the evolution and epidemiology of these organisms. Very few attempts have been made to characterize genetic polymorphisms of parasites isolated from Panamanian patients of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Here we present data on the genetic variability of local isolates of Leishmania, as well as specimens from several other species, by means of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP), a technique seldom used to study genetic makeup of parasites. We demonstrate that this technique allows detection of very high levels of genetic variability in local isolates of Leishmania panamensis in a highly reproducible manner. The analysis of AFLP fingerprints generated by unique selective primer combinations in L. panamensis suggests a predominant clonal mode of reproduction. Using fluorescently labeled primers, many taxon-specific fragments were identified which may show potential as species diagnostic fragments.

This relapse rate of up to 20% within 12 months after treatment was shown not to be related to reinfection, drug quality, drug exposure, or drug-resistant parasites. We therefore aimed to assess other phenotypes of the parasite that may affect treatment outcome and found a significant association between the number of metacyclic parasites, parasite infectivity, and patient treatment outcome in the Indian subcontinent. Together with previous studies on resistance of L. donovani against pentavalent antimonials, these data suggest that the infectivity of the parasite, or related phenotypes, might be a more determinant factor for treatment failure in visceral leishmaniasis than drug susceptibility, warranting a reassessment of our current view on treatment failure and drug resistance in leishmaniasis and beyond.IMPORTANCE: The high miltefosine relapse rate poses a major challenge for the current Kala-Azar Elimination Program in the Indian subcontinent and other leishmaniasis control programs worldwide. This relapse rate could not be related to reinfection, drug-resistant parasites, or reduced treatment quality. Here we report that an increased infectivity of the parasite is associated with miltefosine relapse of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients. These results supplement those obtained with antimonial-resistant L. donovani where an increased infectivity was also observed. This challenges the current view of Leishmania drug susceptibility being the biggest parasitic factor that contributes to treatment failure in leishmaniasis.

However, because of the close genetic similarity of L. braziliensis and L. peruviana, there currently exists no simple assay to distinguish between these species.METHODS: We cloned the mannose phosphate isomerase gene from both L. braziliensis and L. peruviana. It is the only known isoenzyme capable of differentiating between L. braziliensis and L. peruviana in multilocus enzyme electrophoresis.

The secondary objective was to compare the effect of warfarin-antibiotic interactions on outcomes of overanticoagulation.METHODS: Data for this retrospective cohort study were collected through a medical record review of patients in an outpatient anticoagulation clinic of a Veterans Affairs medical center. Patients aged ≥65 years on stable warfarin therapy and with at least 1 prescription of an oral antibiotic of interest during the period from January 1, 2003 to March 1, 2011 were included. A mixed-effects repeated-measures ANOVA model was used to determine the effect of antibiotics on the mean change in patients' INR. The Fisher exact test was used to determine the association between the antibiotics and secondary outcomes of overanticoagulation, using cephalexin as the control. Statistical significance was defined as a P value <0.05.RESULTS: A total of 205 patients had 364 prescriptions for warfarin and antibiotics concomitantly, and there was a significant interaction between antibiotic and time (F(15, 358) = 1.9; P = 0.0221). Antibiotics with a significant increase in INR were amoxicillin (P = 0.0019), azithromycin (P < 0.0001), ciprofloxacin (P = 0.002), levofloxacin (P < 0.0001) and moxifloxacin (P < 0.0001). There was a significant association between type of antibiotic and secondary outcomes of overanticoagulation.CONCLUSIONS: In older patients on stable warfarin therapy, antibiotics may lead to an increase in INR.

Because warfarin undergoes hepatic metabolism and is highly protein bound, it is particularly prone to drug interactions; in addition, its relatively narrow therapeutic window places patients at risk of either hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Although warfarin's interactions with other drugs have long been studied, the most recent review of the literature of warfarin's interactions with psychotropics was over a decade ago. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of the literature documenting the interaction between warfarin and psychotropics, with a focus on interactions mediated through the cytochrome P450 system and protein binding. A search of the MEDLINE database was performed, and reports of warfarin interactions with psychotropics were identified. The results suggest that interactions between warfarin and psychotropic drugs are important and likely underrecognized. They also have notable implications for both safety and drug compliance. When certain psychotropics are started or discontinued in patients receiving warfarin therapy, or when warfarin is introduced to a patient receiving a stable dose of a psychotropic, clinicians should monitor a patient's international normalized ratio (INR) closely to ensure it remains within therapeutic range. Psychotropics that pose a particular risk of increasing the INR when used with warfarin include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, quetiapine, and valproic acid. Psychotropics that may significantly decrease the INR when used with warfarin include trazodone, St. John's wort, carbamazepine, and the polycyclic aromatic carbons in tobacco cigarettes; however, nicotine itself, as in nicotine replacement strategies, is not known to alter warfarin's anticoagulant effect.

Noteworthy are the interactions with cardiovascular or antilipidaemic drugs which are often coadministered with coumarins: amiodarone, propafenone and fibrates. Cardiovascular drugs which are obviously devoid or proven to be devoid of an interaction are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and cardiac glycosides. There are several other drugs which enhance the hypoprothrombinaemic response to coumarins by various mechanisms: inhibitors of the elimination of the eutomer S-(-)-warfarin (e.g. miconazole, phenylbutazone), combined with protein binding displacement (e.g., sulfinpyrazone, phenylbutazone), synergistic hypoprothrombinaemia (e.g. cefazoline). Furthermore, bleeding complications may occur with drugs affecting platelet function [aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Strong inducers of coumarin metabolism are rifampicin (rifampin) and carbamazepine. Biphasic interactions may occur where a drug first enhances the hypoprothrombinaemic response to a coumarin but has a sustained inducing effect on coumarin metabolism (e.g. phenytoin or sulfinpyrazone). The complex response of coumarins to concomitant drug therapy makes it difficult to predict the occurrence and degree of a deterioration of anticoagulant control in individual patients. For clinical practice, it seems advisable that one should monitor for changes in prothrombin time when adding or deleting any newly approved drug or any drug suspected (e.g. on the basis of this review) to cause an interaction to patients on coumarin therapy. The onset of the adverse prothrombin time response might be from between 1 to 2 days up to 3 weeks (in case of phenprocoumon) after starting a concomitant drug regimen. With amiodarone, an adverse prothrombin time response might occur up to 2 months after initiating therapy. For heparins, only a drug interaction with aspirin or nitroglycerin seems clinically relevant due to the possibility of coadministration during acute cardiac events.

Recent evidence suggests that the dominant penicillin-binding protein of ORSA strains (PBP 2a) shows good affinity for ampicillin and that these strains commonly produce beta-lactamase. Therefore, we compared the in vivo efficacy of the combination of ampicillin plus sulbactam with that of vancomycin against ORSA strains. Also, the moderate resistance of BORSA strains appears to be attributable mainly to the hyperproduction of beta-lactamase. Therefore, we also studied the in vivo efficacy of ampicillin plus sulbactam against such organisms. Experimental aortic endocarditis was induced in rabbits by the following three strains: beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strain VP-986, beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain 67-0, and its beta-lactamase-negative clone. In animals with BORSA endocarditis, ampicillin plus sulbactam and oxacillin were highly effective in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities, with each being significantly better than either ampicillin alone or no therapy. In animals with endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain, ampicillin plus sulbactam was significantly better at reducing mean vegetation bacterial densities than the other regimens. For endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-negative ORSA clone, ampicillin was better than vancomycin in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities. These data show that infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strains respond therapeutically in a manner similar to that of infections caused by oxacillin-susceptible strains, with both oxacillin and ampicillin plus sulbactam being highly efficacious. Moreover, high-dose ampicillin treatment strategies were effective in the therapy of ORSA endocarditis; this efficacy is presumably related to the relatively high affinity profile of this compound (compare with that of oxacillin) for the functionally dominant ORSA PBP 2a."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA; mecA-negative, oxacillin MICs of 2 to 8 microgram/ml).", "answer_start": 325}], "question": "What is BORSA?", "id": "5aae6499fcf456587200000c_013", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The probe-based Velogene Rapid MRSA Identification Assay (ID Biomedical Corp., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) and the latex agglutination MRSA-Screen (Denka Seiken Co., Tokyo, Japan) were evaluated for their ability to identify methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and to distinguish strains of MRSA from borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA; mecA-negative, oxacillin MICs of 2 to 8 microgram/ml).

In early studies, treatment with pembrolizumab led to dramatic and durable responses in select patients (PD-L1+ tumors).

Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major driver of GDF-15 production. GDF-15 has favorable preanalytic characteristics and can be measured in serum and plasma by immunoassay.CONTENT: In community-dwelling individuals higher concentrations of GDF-15 are associated with increased risks of developing CV disease, chronic kidney disease, and cancer, independent of traditional CV risk factors, renal function, and other biomarkers (C-reactive protein, B-type natriuretic peptide, cardiac troponin). Low concentrations of GDF-15 are closely associated with longevity. GDF-15 is as an independent marker of all-cause mortality and CV events in patients with coronary artery disease, and may help select patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome for early revascularization and more intensive medical therapies. GDF-15 is independently associated with mortality and nonfatal events in atrial fibrillation and heart failure (HF) with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. GDF-15 reflects chronic disease burden and acute perturbations in HF and responds to improvements in hemodynamic status. GDF-15 is independently associated with major bleeding in patients receiving antithrombotic therapies and has been included in a new bleeding risk score, which may become useful for decision support.SUMMARY: GDF-15 captures distinct aspects of CV disease development, progression, and prognosis, which are not represented by clinical risk predictors and other biomarkers.

Inflammatory mediators and tumour-derived factors are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of CACS. However, the central and peripheral mechanisms contributing to CACS are insufficiently understood. The area postrema (AP) and the nucleus tractus solitarii are two important brainstem centres for the control of eating during acute sickness conditions. Recently, the tumour-derived macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) emerged as a possible mediator of cancer anorexia because lesions of these brainstem areas attenuated the anorectic effect of exogenous MIC-1 in mice.METHODS: Using a rat hepatoma tumour model, we examined the roles of the AP and of vagal afferents in the mediation of CACS. Specifically, we investigated whether a lesion of the AP (APX) or subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) attenuate anorexia, body weight, muscle, and fat loss. Moreover, we analysed MIC-1 levels in this tumour model and their correlation with tumour size and the severity of the anorectic response.RESULTS: In tumour-bearing sham-operated animals mean daily food intake significantly decreased. The anorectic response was paralleled by a significant loss of body weight and muscle mass. APX rats were protected against anorexia, body weight loss, and muscle atrophy after tumour induction. In contrast, subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation did not attenuate cancer-induced anorexia or body weight loss. Tumour-bearing rats had substantially increased MIC-1 levels, which positively correlated with tumour size and cancer progression and negatively correlated with food intake.CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the importance of the AP in the mediation of cancer-dependent anorexia and body weight loss and support a pathological role of MIC-1 as a tumour-derived factor mediating CACS, possibly via an AP-dependent action.© 2016 The Authors.

The disease is primarily caused by C-terminal truncation mutations of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, giving these CXCR4-WHIM mutants a gain of function in response to their ligand CXCL12. Considering the broad functions of CXCR4 in maintaining leukocyte homeostasis, patients are panleukopenic and display altered immune responses, likely as a consequence of impairment in the differentiation and trafficking of leukocytes. Treatment of WHIM patients currently consists of symptom relief, leading to unsatisfactory clinical responses. As an alternative and potentially more effective approach, we tested the potency and efficacy of CXCR4-specific nanobodies on inhibiting CXCR4-WHIM mutants. Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins based on the smallest functional fragments of heavy chain antibodies. They combine the advantages of small-molecule drugs and antibody-based therapeutics due to their relative small size, high stability, and high affinity. We compared the potential of monovalent and bivalent CXCR4-specific nanobodies to inhibit CXCL12-induced CXCR4-WHIM-mediated signaling with the small-molecule clinical candidate AMD3100. The CXCR4-targeting nanobodies displace CXCL12 binding and bind CXCR4-wild type and CXCR4-WHIM (R334X/S338X) mutants and with (sub-) nanomolar affinities. The nanobodies' epitope was mapped to extracellular loop 2 of CXCR4, overlapping with the binding site of CXCL12. Monovalent, and in particular bivalent, nanobodies were more potent than AMD3100 in reducing CXCL12-mediated G protein activation. In addition, CXCR4-WHIM-dependent calcium flux and wound healing of human papillomavirus-immortalized cell lines in response to CXCL12 was effectively inhibited by the nanobodies.

Searching for a mechanistic explanation for these observations, we uncovered a novel costimulatory effect of CXCL12, the CXCR4 ligand, on WHIM-mutant but not wild-type B cells. The WHIM CXCR4-mediated costimulation led to increased B-cell activation, possibly involving mTOR, albeit without concurrently promoting survival. A reduction in antigenic load during immunization in the mouse was able to circumvent the adaptive immunity defects.

Duplication mechanisms include small-scale, or \"local\", events such as unequal crossing over and retroposition, together with global events, such as chromosomal or whole genome duplication (WGD). In particular, different studies confirmed that the yeast S. cerevisiae arose from a 100-150 million-year old whole-genome duplication. Detection and study of duplications are usually based on sequence alignment, synteny and phylogenetic techniques, but protein domains are also useful in assessing protein homology. We develop a simple and computationally efficient protein domain architecture comparison method based on the domain assignments available from public databases. We test the accuracy and the reliability of this method in detecting instances of gene duplication in the yeast S. cerevisiae. In particular, we analyze the evolution of WGD and non-WGD paralogs from the domain viewpoint, in comparison with a more standard functional analysis of the genes. A large number of domains is shared by genes that underwent local and global duplications, indicating the existence of a common set of \"duplicable\" domains. On the other hand, WGD and non-WGD paralogs tend to have different functions. We find evidence that this comes from functional migration within similar domain superfamilies, but also from the existence of small sets of WGD and non-WGD specific domain superfamilies with largely different functions. This observation gives a novel perspective on the finding that WGD paralogs tend to be functionally different from small-scale paralogs. WGD and non-WGD superfamilies carry distinct functions. Finally, the Gene Ontology similarity of paralogs tends to decrease with duplication age, while this tendency is weaker or not observable by the comparison of the domain architectures of paralogs. This suggests that the set of domains composing a protein tends to be maintained, while its function, cellular process or localization diversifies.

For this purpose, we developed a novel motif-discovery tool termed fexcom that systematically interrogates ChIP-seq data to discover spatially constrained TF-TF composite motifs occurring over short DNA distances. We applied this to the extensive ChIP-seq data available from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In addition to the well-known and most prevalent sox-oct motif, we also discovered a novel constrained spacer motif for Esrrb and Sox2 with a gap of between 2 and 8 bps that Essrb and Sox2 cobind in a selective fashion. Through the use of knockdown experiments, we argue that the Esrrb-Sox2 complex is an arbiter of gene expression differences between ESCs and epiblast stem cells (EpiSC). A number of genes downregulated upon dual Esrrb/Sox2 knockdown (e.g., Klf4, Klf5, Jam2, Pecam1) are similarly downregulated in the ESC to EpiSC transition and contain the esrrb-sox motif. The prototypical Esrrb-Sox2 target gene, containing an esrrb-sox element conserved throughout eutherian and metatherian mammals, is Nr0b1.

In fungi, a number of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are involved in the remodeling of the cell wall polymers. GPIs follow a specific biosynthetic pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. After the transfer of the protein onto the GPI-anchor, a lipid remodeling occurs to substitute the diacylglycerol moiety by a ceramide. In addition to GPI-APs, A. fumigatus produces a GPI-anchored polysaccharide, the galactomannan (GM), that remains unique in the fungal kingdom. To investigate the role of the GPI pathway in the biosynthesis of the GM and cell wall organization, the deletion of PER1-coding for a phospholipase required for the first step of the GPI lipid remodeling-was undertaken. Biochemical characterization of the GPI-anchor isolated from GPI-APs showed that the PER1 deficient mutant produced a lipid anchor with a diacylglycerol. The absence of a ceramide on GPI-anchors in the Δper1 mutant led to a mislocation of GPI-APs and to an alteration of the composition of the cell wall alkali-insoluble fraction. On the other hand, the GM isolated from the Δper1 mutant membranes possesses a ceramide moiety as the parental strain, showing that GPI anchor of the GM follow a distinct unknown biosynthetic pathway."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Our results showed that BDH2 expression was decreased, intracellular iron was increased, global DNA hydroxymethylation level was elevated, while methylation level was reduced in lupus CD4+ T cells compared with healthy controls", "answer_start": 321}], "question": "In which way does DNA hydroxymethylation affect patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?", "id": "5c34ac49da8336e21a000006_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "DNA hypomethylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Epigenetic alteration can be the net result of preceding infections, medication, diet, and/or other environmental influences. While altered DNA methylation and histone modifications had already been established as pathomechanisms, DNA hydroxymethylation was more recently identified as an activating epigenetic mark.

Although the exact cause of SLE is still unknown, the influence of environment, which is largely reflected by the epigenetic mechanisms, with DNA methylation changes in particular, are generally considered as key players in the pathogenesis of SLE. As an important post-translational modification, DNA methylation mainly suppresses the expression of relevant genes. Accumulating evidence has indicated that abnormal DNA hypomethylation in T cells is an important epigenetic hallmark in SLE. Apart from those classic methylation-sensitive autoimmunity-related genes in lupus, such as CD11a (ITGAL), Perforin (PRF1), CD70 (TNFSF7), CD40 ligand (TNFSF5) and PP2Acα, the genome-wide methylation pattern has also been explored recently, providing us a more and more full-scale picture of the abnormal status of DNA methylation in SLE.

An Agilent Q44h global expressing microarray was probed after restoring the expression of HIC-1. Data demonstrated that HIC-1 expression was reduced significantly in breast cancer tissues. HIC-1 immunohistochemistry resulted in mean staining scores in cancer tissue and normal ductal epithelia of 3.54 and 8.2, respectively (p<0.01). 5-CdR partially reversed HIC-1 expression, and modulated cell growth and apoptosis. dsHIC1-2998, an saRNA, showed activating efficacy in breast cancer cells. A group of differentially expressed genes were characterized by cDNA microarray. Upon saRNA treatment, genes upregulated included those involved in immune activation, cell cycle interference, the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, and cell differentiation. Downregulated genes included oncogenes and those that play roles in cell invasion, cell growth, and cell division.

Most patients with advanced HCC who are not eligible for surgery have limited treatment options due to poor liver function or large, unresectable tumors. Although sorafenib is the standard-of-care treatment for these patients, only a small number respond. For the remaining, the outlook remains bleak. A better approach to target \"undruggable\" molecular pathways that reverse HCC is therefore urgently needed. Small activating RNAs (saRNAs) may provide a novel strategy to activate expression of genes that become dysregulated in chronic disease. The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), a critical regulator of hepatocyte function, is suppressed in many advanced liver diseases. By using an saRNA to activate C/EBPα, we can exploit the cell's own transcription machinery to enhance gene expression without relying on exogenous vectors that have been the backbone of gene therapy. saRNAs do not integrate into the host genome and can be modified to avoid immune stimulation. In preclinical models of liver disease, treatment with C/EBPα saRNA has shown reduction in tumor volume and improvement in serum markers of essential liver function such as albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT).

LC-MS analyses demonstrated that identified fragments of TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 from digestion by gingipains were similar to those by trypsin.CONCLUSIONS: Using MALDI-TOF/TOF and LC-MS, the present study provides new information that gingipains containing trypsin-like activities are able to digest TFF peptides.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The proteolytic effects of gingipains on TFF peptides may be responsible for reduction of salivary TFF peptides in chronic periodontitis patients.

The reaction kinetics suggested that GlyGly may function as an acceptor molecule for gingipain-catalyzed transpeptidation. Purified gingipains and P. gingivalis whole cells were used to digest selected substrates including human hemoglobin in the presence or absence of peptide acceptors. Mass spectrometric analysis of the substrates digested with gingipains in the presence of GlyGly showed that transpeptidation outcompeted hydrolysis, whereas the trypsin-digested controls exhibited predominantly hydrolysis activity. The transpeptidation levels increased with increasing concentration of GlyGly. Purified gingipains and whole cells exhibited extensive transpeptidation activities on human hemoglobin. All hemoglobin cleavage sites were found to be suitable for GlyGly transpeptidation, and this transpeptidation enhanced hemoglobin digestion. The transpeptidation products were often more abundant than the corresponding hydrolysis products. In the absence of GlyGly, hemoglobin peptides produced during digestion were utilized as acceptors leading to the detection of up to 116 different transpeptidation products in a single reaction. P. gingivalis cells were able to digest hemoglobin faster when acceptor peptides derived from human serum albumin were included in the reaction, suggesting that gingipain-catalyzed transpeptidation may be relevant for substrates encountered in vivo.

Porphyromonas gingivalis expresses several proteinaceous hemin-binding sites, which are important in the binding/transport of heme/hemin from the host. It also synthesizes several virulence factors, namely cysteine-proteases Arg- and Lys-gingipains and two lipopolysaccharides (LPS), O-LPS and A-LPS. The gingipains are required for the production of the black pigment, μ-oxo-bisheme {[Fe(III)PPIX]2 O}, which is derived from hemoglobin and deposited on the bacterial cell-surface leading to the characteristic black colonies when grown on blood agar. In this study we investigated the role of LPS in the deposition of μ-oxo-bisheme on the cell-surface. A P. gingivalis mutant defective in the biosynthesis of Arg-gingipains, namely rgpA/rgpB, produces brown colonies on blood agar and mutants defective in Lys-gingipain (kgp) and LPS biosynthesis namely porR, waaL, wzy, and pg0129 (α-1, 3-mannosyltransferase) produce non-pigmented colonies. However, only those mutants lacking A-LPS showed reduced hemin-binding when cells in suspension were incubated with hemin. Using native, de-O-phosphorylated and de-lipidated LPS from P. gingivalis W50 and porR strains, we demonstrated that hemin-binding to O-polysaccharide (PS) and to the lipid A moiety of LPS was reduced compared with hemin-binding to A-PS.

Therefore, insulin currently remains the optimal antidiabetic treatment during lactation. In conclusion, breastfeeding could be considered a modifiable risk factor for the development of diabetes and even a potential protective lifestyle measure from future cardio-metabolic and malignant diseases.

However, theoretical predictions suggest such backup by redundancy is evolutionarily unstable, and the extent of genetic robustness contributed from redundancy remains controversial. It is anticipated that, to achieve mutual buffering, the duplicated paralogs must at least share some functional overlap. However, counter-intuitively, several recent studies reported little functional redundancy between these buffering duplicates. The large yeast genetic interactions released recently allowed us to address these issues on a genome-wide scale. We herein characterized the synthetic genetic interactions for ∼500 pairs of yeast duplicated genes originated from either whole-genome duplication (WGD) or small-scale duplication (SSD) events. We established that functional redundancy between duplicates is a pre-requisite and thus is highly predictive of their backup capacity. This observation was particularly pronounced with the use of a newly introduced metric in scoring functional overlap between paralogs on the basis of gene ontology annotations. Even though mutual buffering was observed to be prevalent among duplicated genes, we showed that the observed backup capacity is largely an evolutionarily transient state. The loss of backup capacity generally follows a neutral mode, with the buffering strength decreasing in proportion to divergence time, and the vast majority of the paralogs have already lost their backup capacity. These observations validated previous theoretic predictions about instability of genetic redundancy. However, departing from the general neutral mode, intriguingly, our analysis revealed the presence of natural selection in stabilizing functional overlap between SSD pairs. These selected pairs, both WGD and SSD, tend to have decelerated functional evolution, have higher propensities of co-clustering into the same protein complexes, and share common interacting partners.

The intrinsic limitations of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), including non-linearity, multidimensionality and floor-effect, have emerged and its usefulness argued. The ALS Milano-Torino staging (ALS-MITOS) system was proposed as a novel tool to measure the progression of ALS and overcome these limitations. This study was performed to validate the ALS-MITOS as a 6-month proxy of survival in 200 ALS patients followed up to 18 months.METHODS: Analyses were performed on data from the recombinant human erythropoietin RCT that failed to demonstrate differences between groups for both primary and secondary outcomes. The ALS-MITOS system is composed of four key domains included in the ALSFRS-R scale (walking/self-care, swallowing, communicating and breathing), each with a threshold reflecting the loss of function in the specific ALSFRS-R subscores. Sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves of the ALS-MITOS system stages and ALSFRS-R decline at 6 months were calculated and compared with the primary outcome (survival, tracheotomy or >23-hour non-invasive ventilation) at 12 and 18 months Predicted probabilities of the ALS-MITO system at 6 months for any event at 12 and 18 months were computed through logistic regression models.RESULTS: Disease progression from baseline to 6 months as defined by the ALS-MITOS system predicted death, tracheotomy or >23-hour non-invasive ventilation at 12 months with 82% sensitivity (95% CI 71% to 93%, n=37/45) and 63% specificity (95% CI 55% to 71%, n=92/146), and at 18 months with 71% sensitivity (95% CI 61% to 82%, n=50/70) and 68% specificity (95% CI 60% to 77%, n=76/111). The analysis of ALS-MITOS and ALSFRS-R progression at 6-month follow-up showed that the best cut-off to predict survival at 12 and 18 months was 1 for the ALS-MITOS (ie, loss of at least one function) and a decline ranging from 6 to 9 points for the ALSFRS-R.CONCLUSIONS: The ALS-MITOS system can reliably predict the course of ALS up to 18 months and can be considered a novel and valid outcome measure in RCTs.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Patient medical history was extensive with coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, lipidemia, insulin-dependent diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, and untreated severe renal failure. Before the incident, patient medication included warfarin, 81 mg of aspirin, insulin, glipizide, and blood pressure regime with which the patient was noncompliant. The patient was forwarded to urgent care to address his stage 2 hypertension and referred for a medical evaluation, which included a complete blood count, an International Normalized Ratio, a prothrombin time, and a glycated hemoglobin.CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous resolution of the hemolacria occurred within 24 hr after evaluation and restoration of blood pressure to normal range. Before follow-up, the patient died because of kidney failure.

Herein the safety and efficacy of vesatolimod is assessed after once-weekly treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection suppressed on oral antiviral treatment.METHODS: In a phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo (PBO)-controlled study, 162 patients stratified by hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels and serum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status were randomized 1:3:3:3 to once-weekly oral PBO or vesatolimod (1-, 2-, or 4-mg doses) for 4, 8 or 12 weeks per cohort. Efficacy was assessed by change in baseline HBsAg (log10 IU/ml) at the primary endpoint (Week 24). Safety assessments included adverse events (AE) and laboratory abnormality monitoring. Pharmacodynamic assessments included peripheral cytokine level quantification and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) mRNA expression evaluation.RESULTS: The majority of patients were male (76%) and HBeAg-negative (79%) at baseline. Most (41-80%) experienced ≥1 AE during the study with the majority of AEs mild or moderate in severity. No significant declines in HBsAg were observed at the primary (Week 24) or secondary endpoints (Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 48). ISG15 induction was dose-dependent and consistent after repeat dosing, returning closer to baseline by one week after treatment at all dose levels; no patient demonstrated significant serum interferon alpha (IFNα) expression at any timepoint evaluated. Multivariate analyses showed that ≥2-fold ISG15 induction is associated with 2- or 4-mg vesatolimod dose and female sex.CONCLUSIONS: Vesatolimod was safe and well-tolerated in patients with CHB, demonstrating consistent dose-dependent pharmacodynamic induction of ISG15 without significant systemic induction of IFNα expression or related symptoms.

SeC treatment also resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction through affecting Bcl-2 family expression. Moreover, SeC triggered p53 phosphorylation by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction. ROS inhibition effectively blocked SeC-induced cytotoxicity and p53 phosphorylation.

We also conducted a placebo-controlled pharmacokinetic and safety trial involving 449 adult volunteers.RESULTS: The minimum dose of tecovirimat required in order to achieve more than 90% survival in the monkeypox model was 10 mg per kilogram of body weight for 14 days, and a dose of 40 mg per kilogram for 14 days was similarly efficacious in the rabbitpox model. Although the effective dose per kilogram was higher in rabbits, exposure was lower, with a mean steady-state maximum, minimum, and average (mean) concentration (Cmax, Cmin, and Cavg, respectively) of 374, 25, and 138 ng per milliliter, respectively, in rabbits and 1444, 169, and 598 ng per milliliter in nonhuman primates, as well as an area under the concentration-time curve over 24 hours (AUC0-24hr) of 3318 ng×hours per milliliter in rabbits and 14,352 ng×hours per milliliter in nonhuman primates. These findings suggested that the nonhuman primate was the more conservative model for the estimation of the required drug exposure in humans. A dose of 600 mg twice daily for 14 days was selected for testing in humans and provided exposures in excess of those in nonhuman primates (mean steady-state Cmax, Cmin, and Cavg of 2209, 690, and 1270 ng per milliliter and AUC0-24hr of 30,632 ng×hours per milliliter).

In addition, tecovirimat treatment resulted in dramatic reductions in dermal lesion counts, oropharyngeal virus shedding, and viral DNA circulating in the blood. Although clinical disease was evident in tecovirimat-treated animals, it was generally very mild and appeared to resolve earlier than in placebo-treated controls that survived infection.

Further, studies using animal model of periodontitis and human post-mortem brain tissues from subjects with AD strongly suggest that a gram-negative periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and/or its product gingipain is/are translocated to the brain. However, neuropathology resulting from Pg oral application is not known. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that repeated exposure of wild type C57BL/6 mice to orally administered Pg results in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, microgliosis, astrogliosis and formation of intra- and extracellular amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which are pathognomonic signs of AD.METHODS: Experimental chronic periodontitis was induced in ten wild type 8-week old C57BL/6 WT mice by repeated oral application (MWF/week) of Pg/gingipain for 22 weeks (experimental group). Another 10 wild type 8-week old C57BL/6 mice received vehicle alone (control group) MWF per week for 22 weeks. Brain tissues were collected and the presence of Pg/gingipain was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy, confocal microscopy, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The hippocampi were examined for the signs of neuropathology related to AD: TNFα, IL1β, and IL6 expression (neuroinflammation), NeuN and Fluoro Jade C staining (neurodegeneration) and amyloid beta1-42 (Aβ42) production and phosphorylation of tau protein at Ser396 were assessed by IF and confocal microscopy. Further, gene expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein10 (ADAM10) for α-secretase and presenilin1 (PSEN1) for ɣ-secretase, and NeuN (rbFox3) were determined by RT-qPCR. Microgliosis and astrogliosis were also determined by IF microscopy.RESULTS: Pg/gingipain was detected in the hippocampi of mice in the experimental group by immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and qPCR confirming the translocation of orally applied Pg to the brain. Pg/gingipain was localized intra-nuclearly and peri-nuclearly in microglia (Iba1+), astrocytes (GFAP+), neurons (NeuN+) and was evident extracellularly. Significantly greater levels of expression of IL6, TNFα and IL1β were evident in experimental as compared to control group (p<0.01, p<0.00001, p<0.00001 respectively). In addition, microgliosis and astrogliosis were evident in the experimental but not in control group (p <0.01, p<0.0001 respectively). Neurodegeneration was evident in the experimental group based on a fewer number of intact neuronal cells assessed by NeuN positivity and rbFOX3 gene expression, and there was a greater number of degenerating neurons in the hippocampi of experimental mice assessed by Fluoro Jade C positivity. APP and BACE1 gene expression were increased in experimental group compared with control group (p<0.05, p<0.001 respectively). PSEN1 gene expression was higher in experimental than control group but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). ADAM10 gene expression was significantly decreased in experimental group compared with control group (p<0.01). Extracellular Aβ42 was detected in the parenchyma in the experimental but not in the control group (p< 0.00001). Finally, phospho-Tau (Ser396) protein was detected and NFTs were evident in experimental but not in the control group (p<0.00001).CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to show neurodegeneration and the formation of extracellular Aβ42 in young adult WT mice after repeated oral application of Pg. The neuropathological features observed in this study strongly suggest that low grade chronic periodontal pathogen infection can result in the development of neuropathology that is consistent with that of AD."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The polymicrobial dysbiotic subgingival biofilm microbes associated with periodontal disease appear to contribute to developing pathologies in distal body sites, including the brain.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Is P. gingivalis bacteria found in brain?", "id": "5c5f2b771a4c55d80b000020_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The polymicrobial dysbiotic subgingival biofilm microbes associated with periodontal disease appear to contribute to developing pathologies in distal body sites, including the brain.

Although most MS patients have a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS) at disease onset, a substantial proportion later develop chronic progression, termed secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Approximately 10% of MS patients experience chronic progression from disease onset, termed primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Although several disease-modifying treatment (DMT) options exist for relapsing forms of this disease, DMT options are few for progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS). Herein, we strive to define progressive MS, review major clinical trials aimed at progressive MS, and delineate potential strategies in the management of progressive MS.RECENT FINDINGS: In 2017, the first DMT for PPMS, the B lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody, ocrelizumab, came to market. Ocrelizumab reduced 12-week confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 24% versus placebo. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, reduced 3-month CDP by 21% versus placebo in SPMS. Ibudilast slowed brain atrophy in PPMS and SPMS patients in a multicenter phase 2b study. Smaller early phase studies of alpha-lipoic acid and simvastatin each found slowing of rate of whole brain atrophy in SPMS patients. Reasons now exist for optimism in the search for DMTs for progressive MS. It remains a challenge to identify outcome measures that accurately reflect the underlying pathology in progressive MS, which is less inflammatory and more degenerative than RRMS."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " Ibudilast inhibits several cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, and toll-like receptor 4 and can cross the blood-brain barrier, with potential salutary effects in progressive multiple sclerosis.", "answer_start": 76}], "question": "Is ibudilast effective for multiple sclerosis?", "id": "5c58ac2286df2b917400000f_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: There are limited treatments for progressive multiple sclerosis.

The results from preclinical and clinical studies indicate that IBD has a broader range of action through suppression of pro‑inflammatory cytokines (IL‑6, IL‑1β, TNF‑α), toll‑like receptor 4 blockade (TLR‑4), inhibition of a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), up‑regulation the anti‑inflammatory cytokine (IL‑10), and promotion of neurotrophic factors (GDNF, NGF, NT‑4). Recent data indicate that the efficacy of IBD appears to be independent from PDE inhibition activity and rather linked to glial activity attenuation. Additional advantages of IBD, such as crossing the blood-brain barrier, good tolerance and activity by oral administration, makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for treating neuroinflammatory conditions, where the currently available treatment remains unsatisfying due to poor tolerability and/or sub‑optimal efficacy.

Differential expression analysis for sequence count data was used to identify specific genera associated with GI tract symptoms.RESULTS: Among 17 patients with SSc (88% female; median age 52.1 years), the mean ± SD total GI Tract 2.0 score was 0.7 ± 0.6. Principal coordinate analysis illustrated significant differences in microbial communities in the cecum and sigmoid regions in SSc patients versus healthy controls (both P = 0.001). Similar to the findings in inflammatory disease states, SSc patients had decreased levels of commensal bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium and Clostridium, and increased levels of pathobiont bacteria, such as Fusobacterium and γ-Proteobacteria, compared with healthy controls. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which are typically reduced under conditions of inflammation, were also increased in abundance in patients with SSc. In SSc patients with moderate/severe GI tract symptoms, the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis was decreased, and that of Fusobacterium was increased, compared with patients who had no or mild symptoms.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a distinct colonic microbial signature in SSc patients compared with healthy controls. This unique ecologic change may perpetuate immunologic aberrations and contribute to clinical manifestations of SSc.© 2016, American College of Rheumatology."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " The colonic and cecal microbiota of healthy mice fed α-MG but no DSS shifted to an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, a profile similar to that found in human UC", "answer_start": 852}], "question": "Are gut proteobacteria associated with inflammatory disease?", "id": "5ad3130c0340b9f05800001d_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "SCOPE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. α-Mangostin (α-MG), the most abundant xanthone in mangosteen fruit, exerts anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities in vitro. We evaluated the impact of dietary α-MG on murine experimental colitis and on the gut microbiota of healthy mice.METHODS AND RESULTS: Colitis was induced in C57BL/6J mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Mice were fed control diet or diet with α-MG (0.1%). α-MG exacerbated the pathology of DSS-induced colitis. Mice fed diet with α-MG had greater colonic inflammation and injury, as well as greater infiltration of CD3(+) and F4/80(+) cells, and colonic myeloperoxidase, than controls. Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, and serum amyloid A were also greater in α-MG-fed animals than in controls. The colonic and cecal microbiota of healthy mice fed α-MG but no DSS shifted to an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, a profile similar to that found in human UC.CONCLUSION: α-MG exacerbated colonic pathology during DSS-induced colitis. These effects may be associated with an induction of intestinal dysbiosis by α-MG.

The NeuroBlate® System (Monteris Medical, MN, USA) was used to conform the thermal burn to the corpus callosum along the trajectory of the probe. The distance of the ideal entry site from either the coronal suture and the torcula or nasion and the midline was calculated. The distance of the probe tip from the dorsal and ventral limits of the callosotomy in the sagittal plane were also calculated.RESULTS: Anterior two-thirds callosotomy was possible in all patients using a posterior parieto-occipital paramedian trajectory through the non-dominant lobe. The average entry point was 3.64 cm from the midline, 10.6 cm behind the coronal suture, and 9.2 cm above the torcula. The probe tip was an average of 1.4 cm from the anterior commissure. For a total callosotomy, an additional contralaterally placed frontal probe was used to target the posterior one-third of the corpus callosum. The average entry site was 3.3 cm from the midline and 9.1 cm above the nasion. The average distance of the probe tip from the base of the splenium was 0.94 cm.CONCLUSION: The directional thermoablation capability of the NeuroBlate® system allows for targeted lesioning of the corpus callosum, to achieve a two-thirds or complete corpus callosotomy.

After confirmatory biopsy, treatment was delivered using a rigid, gas-cooled, side-firing laser probe. Treatment was monitored using real-time MRI thermometry, and proprietary software providing predictive thermal damage feedback was used by the surgeon, along with control of probe rotation and depth, to tailor tissue coagulation. An external data safety monitoring board determined if toxicity at lower levels justified dose escalation.RESULTS: Ten patients were treated at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals-Case Medical Center). Their average age was 55 years (range 34-69 years) and the median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status score was 80 (range 70-90). The mean tumor volume was 6.8 ± 5 cm(3) (range 2.6-19 cm(3)), the percentage of tumor treated was 78% ± 12% (range 57%-90%), and the conformality index was 1.21 ± 0.33 (range 1.00-2.04).

Myogenic regulatory factor MyoD is regarded as the master activator of myogenic differentiation cascade by binding to enhancer of muscle specific genes. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a condition primarily resulted from urethral sphincter deficiency. It is thus expected that by promoting differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) into myoblasts by activating MyoD gene through RNAa may offer benefits to SUI.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats ADSCs were isolated, proliferated in vitro, and identified by flow cytometry. Purified ADSCs were then transfected with a MyoD saRNA or control transfected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to detect MyoD mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Immunocytochemical staining was applied to determine the expression of desmin protein in transfected cells. Cell viability was measured by using CellTiter 96R AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit.RESULTS: Transfection of a MyoD saRNA (dsMyoD) into ADSCs signiﬁcantly induced the expression of MyoD at both the mRNA and protein levels, and inhibited cell proliferation. Desmin protein expression was detected in dsMyoD treated ADSCs 2 weeks later.CONCLUSION: Our findings show that RNAa mediated overexpression of MyoD can promote transdifferentiation of ADSCs into myoblasts and may help treat stress urinary incontinence (SUI)-a condition primarily resulted from urethral sphincter deficiency."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " Finally, targeted agents inhibiting multiple kinases (rigosertib), BCL2 (venetoclax) or mutant IDH1 (ivosidenib), IDH2 (enasidenib), FLT3 (sorafenib, midostaurin) or spliceosome components (H3B-8800) are other novel options.", "answer_start": 963}], "question": "What is the mechanism of action of Ivosidenib?", "id": "5c58a0e486df2b917400000c_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are the standard of care for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

Newer HMAs, less susceptible to in-vivo deamination, such as guadecitabine or ASTX727 have shown activity. Alterations of immune checkpoints in MDS have led to multiple clinical trials evaluating the activity of monoclonal antibodies targeting these proteins (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab).

In a phase I/II clinical trial, enasidenib inhibited the production of 2HG and induced clinical responses in relapsed or refractory IDH2-mutant AML11. Here we describe two patients with IDH2-mutant AML who had a clinical response to enasidenib followed by clinical resistance, disease progression, and a recurrent increase in circulating levels of 2HG. We show that therapeutic resistance is associated with the emergence of second-site IDH2 mutations in trans, such that the resistance mutations occurred in the IDH2 allele without the neomorphic R140Q mutation. The in trans mutations occurred at glutamine 316 (Q316E) and isoleucine 319 (I319M), which are at the interface where enasidenib binds to the IDH2 dimer. The expression of either of these mutant disease alleles alone did not induce the production of 2HG; however, the expression of the Q316E or I319M mutation together with the R140Q mutation in trans allowed 2HG production that was resistant to inhibition by enasidenib. Biochemical studies predicted that resistance to allosteric IDH inhibitors could also occur via IDH dimer-interface mutations in cis, which was confirmed in a patient with acquired resistance to the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120).

When TFs are bound to active regulatory regions, they displace canonical nucleosomes, making these regions biochemically detectable as nucleosome-depleted regions or accessible/open chromatin. Here we ask whether open chromatin profiling can be used to identify the entire repertoire of active promoters and enhancers underlying tissue-specific gene expression during normal development and oncogenesis in vivo. To this end, we first compare two different approaches to detect open chromatin in vivo using the Drosophila eye primordium as a model system: FAIRE-seq, based on physical separation of open versus closed chromatin; and ATAC-seq, based on preferential integration of a transposon into open chromatin. We find that both methods reproducibly capture the tissue-specific chromatin activity of regulatory regions, including promoters, enhancers, and insulators. Using both techniques, we screened for regulatory regions that become ectopically active during Ras-dependent oncogenesis, and identified 3778 regions that become (over-)activated during tumor development. Next, we applied motif discovery to search for candidate transcription factors that could bind these regions and identified AP-1 and Stat92E as key regulators. We validated the importance of Stat92E in the development of the tumors by introducing a loss of function Stat92E mutant, which was sufficient to rescue the tumor phenotype. Additionally we tested if the predicted Stat92E responsive regulatory regions are genuine, using ectopic induction of JAK/STAT signaling in developing eye discs, and observed that similar chromatin changes indeed occurred. Finally, we determine that these are functionally significant regulatory changes, as nearby target genes are up- or down-regulated. In conclusion, we show that FAIRE-seq and ATAC-seq based open chromatin profiling, combined with motif discovery, is a straightforward approach to identify functional genomic regulatory regions, master regulators, and gene regulatory networks controlling complex in vivo processes."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) technology can interrogate chromatin accessibility from small cell numbers and facilitate studying enhancers in pathologies.", "answer_start": 326}], "question": "Which is the basis of the ATAC-Seq protocol?", "id": "5c34b45eda8336e21a000008_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Enhancers are cis-acting sequences that regulate transcription rates of their target genes in a cell-specific manner and harbor disease-associated sequence variants in cognate cell types.

We analyzed the effects of these treatments on the number of usable (unique, non-mitochondrial) reads and the number and quality of peaks called, including peaks identified in enhancers and transcription start sites. Both treatments resulted in considerable reduction of mitochondrial reads (1.7 and 3-fold, respectively). The removal of detergent, however, resulted in increased background and fewer peaks. The highest number of peaks and highest quality data was obtained by preparing samples with the original ATAC-seq protocol (using detergent) and treating them with CRISPR.

Ohnologs, which amount to about 20 to 35% of genes in the human genome, have also been shown to be prone to dominant deleterious mutations and frequently implicated in cancer and genetic diseases. Hence, identifying ohnologs is central to better understand the evolution of vertebrates and their susceptibility to genetic diseases. Early computational analyses to identify vertebrate ohnologs relied on content-based synteny comparisons between the human genome and a single invertebrate outgroup genome or within the human genome itself. These approaches are thus limited by lineage specific rearrangements in individual genomes. We report, in this study, the identification of vertebrate ohnologs based on the quantitative assessment and integration of synteny conservation between six amniote vertebrates and six invertebrate outgroups. Such a synteny comparison across multiple genomes is shown to enhance the statistical power of ohnolog identification in vertebrates compared to earlier approaches, by overcoming lineage specific genome rearrangements. Ohnolog gene families can be browsed and downloaded for three statistical confidence levels or recompiled for specific, user-defined, significance criteria at http://ohnologs.curie.fr/.

We query whether the spatial distribution of ohnologs has implications for their dosage balance. We analyzed the colocalization frequency of ohnologs based on chromatin interaction datasets of seven human cell lines and found that ohnolog pairs exhibit higher spatial proximity in 3D nuclear organization than other paralog pairs and than randomly chosen ohnologs in the genome. We also found that colocalized ohnologs are more resistant to copy number variations and more likely to be disease-associated genes, which indicates a stronger dosage balance in ohnologs with high spatial proximity. This phenomenon is further supported by the stronger similarity of gene co-expression and of gene ontology terms of colocalized ohnologs.

Caplacizumab's effect on major thromboembolic (TE) events, exacerbations and death was studied. Fewer caplacizumab-treated patients had a major TE event, an exacerbation, or died versus placebo. Caplacizumab has the potential to reduce the acute morbidity and mortality associated with aTTP.SUMMARY: Background Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is a life-threatening autoimmune thrombotic microangiopathy. In spite of treatment with plasma exchange and immunosuppression, patients remain at risk for thrombotic complications, exacerbations, and death. In the phase II TITAN study, treatment with caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody® was shown to reduce the time to confirmed platelet count normalization and exacerbations during treatment. Objective The clinical benefit of caplacizumab was further investigated in a post hoc analysis of the incidence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations during the study drug treatment period and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-related death during the study. Methods The Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query (SMQ) for 'embolic and thrombotic events' was run to investigate the occurrence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations in the safety population of the TITAN study, which consisted of 72 patients, of whom 35 received caplacizumab and 37 received placebo. Results Four events (one pulmonary embolism and three aTTP exacerbations) were reported in four patients in the caplacizumab group, and 20 such events were reported in 14 patients in the placebo group (two acute myocardial infarctions, one ischemic stroke, one hemorrhagic stroke, one pulmonary embolism, one deep vein thrombosis, one venous thrombosis, and 13 aTTP exacerbations). Two of the placebo-treated patients died from aTTP during the study. Conclusion In total, 11.4% of caplacizumab-treated patients and 43.2% of placebo-treated patients experienced one or more major thromboembolic events, experienced an exacerbation, or died. This analysis shows the potential for caplacizumab to reduce the risk of major thromboembolic morbidities and mortality associated with aTTP.© 2017 The Authors.

Commercialization of camelid sdAbs exploded in 2001 with a flurry of patents issued to the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and later taken on by the Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) and, after 2002, the VIB-founded spin-off company, Ablynx. While entrepreneurial spirit has certainly catalyzed the exploration of nanobodies as marketable products, IP restrictions may be partially responsible for the relatively long time span between the discovery of these biomolecules and their entry into the pharmaceutical market. It is now anticipated that the first VHH-based antibody drug, Caplacizumab, a bivalent anti-vWF antibody for treating rare blood clotting disorders, may be approved and commercialized in 2018 or shortly thereafter.

Some patients with PD are found at autopsy to have other pathologic processes, such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and cerebrovascular disease (vascular Parkinsonism). The peripheral autonomic nervous system is also affected. The triggering event in PD is unknown, but recent studies suggest a role for loss of nuclear membrane integrity. Once α-synuclein aggregates forms, evidence supports cell-to-cell propagation.CONCLUSION: PD is a multisystem synucleinopathy caused by poorly characterized genetic and environmental factors that produces degeneration in selectively vulnerable neuronal populations.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The Lewy body was described in 1912, and the substantia nigra was found to be depigmented with neuronal loss and gliosis in 1919. The link between dopamine and PD began in 1957, 140 years after Parkinson's Essay. Arvid Carlsson and Oleh Hornykiewicz were the major pioneers. The revolutionary therapeutic breakthrough was the introduction of high dosage levodopa therapy by George Cotzias in 1967. Following 40 years of the dopa/dopamine era, we have entered the era of alpha-synuclein, the protein present in Lewy bodies. Heiko Braak found that alpha-synuclein accumulates initially in the olfactory system and lower brainstem and then travels in an anatomic pattern to involve other regions of the brain and thereby cause progressive symptoms. Alpha-synuclein was somehow converted to a rogue protein. Where this originates and how it is propagated are under intense investigation. At the same time that the alpha-synuclein era was developing, clinical advances took place by recognizing PD as hosting a wide variety of nonmotor features with eventual cognitive impairment in many. Therapeutics has also evolved. Although the most effective therapy for the motor features remains levodopa, surgical approaches and drugs for nonmotor problems continue to expand our ability to treat people with PD. We can expect therapeutic advances in neuroprotection as the basic science discoveries uncovered in the alpha-synuclein era are translated into effective treatments."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Lewy bodies comprise of aggregated intracellular vesicles and proteins and α-synuclein is reported to be a major protein component.

Using human brain tissue from control, PD and DLB and light and confocal immunohistochemistry with antibodies to superoxide dismutase 2 as a marker for mitochondria, α-synuclein for Lewy bodies and βIII Tubulin for microtubules we have examined the relationship between Lewy bodies and mitochondrial loss. We have shown microtubule regression and mitochondrial and nuclear degradation in neurons with developing Lewy bodies. In PD, multiple Lewy bodies were often observed with α-synuclein interacting with DNA to cause marked nuclear degradation. In DLB, the mitochondria are drawn into the Lewy body and the mitochondrial integrity is lost. This work suggests that Lewy bodies are cytotoxic. In DLB, we suggest that microtubule regression and mitochondrial loss results in decreased cellular energy and axonal transport that leads to cell death. In PD, α-synuclein aggregations are associated with intact mitochondria but interacts with and causes nuclear degradation which may be the major cause of cell death."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "he Lewy body constituents, α-synuclein and small ubiquitin-related modifier-1(SUMO-1)", "answer_start": 316}], "question": "Which is the main component of the Lewy body?", "id": "5ad4d758133db5eb78000007_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The pesticide rotenone has been shown to cause systemic inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity, with consequent degeneration of dopamine neurons along the nigrostriatal pathway, as observed in Parkinson's disease (PD).

These findings are supportive of a mouse model of PD, but information about the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an essential marker of dopaminergic status, was not reported. Clarification of this issue is important because an intracranial rotenone mouse model of Parkinson's disease has not been established. Towards this end, the present study examined the effects of intracranial rotenone treatment on TH and α-synuclein immunohistochemistry in addition to forelimb motor function. Mice were unilaterally infused with either vehicle or rotenone (2μg/site) in both the medial forebrain bundle and the substantia nigra. The forelimb asymmetry (cylinder) test indicated a significant decrease in use of the contralateral forelimb in lesioned animals as compared to the sham group. Densitometric analysis revealed a significant depletion of TH immunofluorescence within the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra of lesioned animals. Moreover, a significant bilateral increase in α-synuclein immunofluorescence was found in the substantia nigra of lesioned mice, as compared to control animals.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to differentiate into endothelial lineage cells, which makes them attractive candidates for therapeutic angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate efficient differentiation of MSCs into ECs by inducing medium in vitro.METHODS: MSCs were isolated from bone marrow by density gradient centrifugation. The characterisation of the MSCs was determined by their cluster of differentiation (CD) marker profile. Inducing medium containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), ascorbic acid, and heparin was applied to differentiate the MSCs into ECs. Endothelial differentiation was quantitatively evaluated using flow cytometry. Real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyse mRNA expression of endothelial markers. Tube formation assay was further performed to examine the functional status of the differentiated MSCs.RESULTS: Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that CD31+ and CD34+ cells increased steadily from 12% at 3 days, to 40% at 7 days, and to 60% at 14 days. Immunofluorescence staining further confirmed the expression of CD31 and CD34. qRT-PCR showed that expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF), vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) were significantly higher in the induced MSCs group compared with the uninduced MSCs group. The functional behavior of the differentiated cells was tested by tube formation assay in vitro on matrigel. Induced MSCs were capable of developing capillary networks, and progressive formation of vessel like structures was associated with increased EC population.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a method to efficiently promote differentiation of MSCs into ECs in vitro for potential application in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease.Copyright © 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery.

Several studies have shown an increased expression/release of Th17 related cytokine, IL-17A in ASD. IL-17A may enhance neuroinflammation via its IL-17A receptor, i.e. IL-17RA expressed in immune cells (such as monocytes) of autistic children. Increased oxidative stress has been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. However, whether IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling contributes to oxidative inflammation in monocytes of autistic children has not been explored previously. With this background, we performed this study in peripheral monocytes of ASD patients and age-matched typically developing children. Our study shows that ASD individuals have increased IL-17RA expression in monocytes which is associated with increased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) pathway and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitrotyrosine expression as compared to typically developing children. Moreover, in vitro activation of IL-17 receptor by IL-17A in monocytes isolated from ASD individuals leads to enhanced iNOS expression via NFκB pathway. IL-17RA antibody treatment in vitro reversed IL-17A-induced increase in NFκB and iNOS/nitrotyrosine expression in monocytes isolated from ASD subjects. These data connect increased IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling in ASD patients with enhanced oxidative inflammation in monocytes. Therefore, IL-17 receptor signaling in monocytes may potentiate the effects of IL-17A released by other immune cells and may aggravate neuroinflammation in ASD.

The total number of patients evaluated for toxicities was 3284 patients in the PD-1 group and 2460 patients in the PD-L1 group. The baseline patient characteristics of the 2 groups were similar, although there was a trend toward increased squamous histology in the group treated with PD-L1 (32% vs 25%; P = .6). There was no difference in response rate noted between PD-1 (19%) and PD-L1 (18.6%) inhibitors (P = .17).

In a second search, we added key words related to neuropathology including words \"Alzheimer's disease,\" \"vascular dementia,\" and \"mild cognitive impairment.\"RESULTS: The data suggest that being overweight or obese in midlife may be more detrimental to subsequent age-related cognitive decline than being overweight or obese at later stages of the life span. These effects are likely mediated by the accelerated effects obesity has on the integrity of neural structures, including both gray and white matter. Further epidemiological studies have provided evidence that obesity in midlife is linked to an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, most likely via an increased accumulation of Alzheimer's disease pathology.CONCLUSIONS: Although it is clear that obesity negatively affects cognition, more work is needed to better understand how aging plays a role and how brain structure and brain function might mediate the relationship of obesity and age on cognition.

Here, we examined age, years of education, schizophrenia, and gender differences which might affect the relationship between obesity and cognition.METHODS: 1012 healthy controls and 707 participants with schizophrenia were recruited. Information on body mass index (BMI) was obtained and a neurocognitive battery was administered. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to examine the relationship between BMI, schizophrenia, cognition and its covariates.RESULTS: No significant direct effect of BMI on cognition was found when cognition was regressed on age, years of education, diagnosis of schizophrenia and BMI. Instead, two SEM models indicated that indirect effects between BMI and cognition exist. The indirect effect of BMI on cognition through schizophrenia was present in both genders, while the indirect effect of cognition on BMI through schizophrenia was only found in females. BMI affecting cognition through age, years of education and schizophrenia appears to be the most plausible model that explains the data. This indirect effect was larger in females and was masked by diagnosis of schizophrenia.CONCLUSION: With increased rates of obesity in schizophrenia, it is important to highlight the potentially deleterious effect of obesity on cognition. BMI could be used as a candidate risk marker to identify people at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and as an intervention target for modifications of cognitive outcomes.© 2013."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Obesity is a common medical illness that is increasingly recognised as conferring risk of decline in cognitive performance, independent of other comorbid medical conditions.", "answer_start": 14}], "question": "Is obesity related to cognitive decline?", "id": "5c0e838b133db5eb7800002e_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a common medical illness that is increasingly recognised as conferring risk of decline in cognitive performance, independent of other comorbid medical conditions. Individuals with mood disorders (bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD)) display an increased prevalence of both obesity and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, BD and MDD are associated with impairment in cognitive functioning across multiple domains. The independent contribution of obesity to cognitive decline in this population has not been explored. This study examines the impact of obesity on cognition by comparing neuropsychological performance in obese individuals, with or without a mood disorder before and after undergoing bariatric surgery.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study compares measures of declarative memory, executive functioning and attention in obese individuals (body mass index >35 kg/m(2)) with BD or MDD, and 2 control populations (obese individuals without a psychiatric illness and healthy non-obese controls) prior to and following bariatric surgery. Participants (ages 18-60) receive a psychiatric diagnosis via the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; SCID). Mood ratings, physical measurements, nutritional and health questionnaires are also administered. A standardised battery of neuropsychological tests aimed at establishing performance in areas of declarative memory, executive functioning and attention are administered. Warrington's Recognition Memory Task (RMT) and an N-Back Task are performed in a 3 T functional MRI to investigate patterns of neural activation during cognitive performance. Additionally, anatomical MRI data are obtained to investigate potential changes in neural structures. Baseline data will be analysed for between-group differences and later compared with postsurgical data to investigate cognitive change.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (09-3254).

There is also an association between body mass index (BMI) and cognitive ability. Since low birth weight is associated with adult metabolic disease, particularly in obese subjects, the question emerges whether obesity has an additional negative effect on cognitive function in subjects with low birth weight.OBJECTIVES: The aim was to analyse whether overweight or obesity influence intellectual performance in young adults with particular focus on those with a low birth weight.METHODS: Data were collected from the Swedish Medical Birth Register on 620,834 males born between 1973 and 1988 and matched to results on intellectual performance and BMI at conscription.RESULTS: The risk for low intellectual performance was higher for those with high BMI compared to those with normal. The highest risk was found among subjects with low birth weight and overweight or obesity in young adulthood (odds ratios, 1.98 [1.73-2.22] and 2.59 [2.00-3.34], respectively). However, subjects with further high birth weight and a high BMI at conscription had no further increased risk.CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of subnormal intellectual performance in young adult males. Subjects with low birth weight and adolescent overweight/obesity are at particular risk of subnormal performance. A high birth weight increases the risk for obesity, but a high adult BMI does not further increase the risk for subnormal performance.© 2013 The Authors.

The brain plays a critical role in regulating energy balance. Some human studies have demonstrated increased preference for high fat and high sugar foods in people reporting greater stress exposure. We have examined neurochemical changes in the brain in rodent models during the development of obesity, including the impact of obesity on cognition, reward neurocircuitry and stress responsiveness. Using supermarket foods high in fat and sugar, we showed that such a diet leads to changes in neurotransmitters involved in the hedonic appraisal of foods, indicative of an addiction-like capacity of foods high in fat and/or sugar. Importantly, withdrawal of the palatable diet led to a stress-like response. Furthermore, access to this palatable diet attenuated the physiological effects of acute stress (restraint), indicating that it could act as a comfort food. In more chronic studies, the diet also attenuated anxiety-like behavior in rats exposed to stress (maternal separation) early in life, but these rats may suffer greater metabolic harm than rats exposed to the early life stressor but not provided with the palatable diet. Impairments in cognitive function have been associated with obesity in both people and rodents. However, as little as 1 week of exposure to a high fat, high sugar diet selectively impaired place but not object recognition memory in the rat. Excess sugar alone had similar effects, and both diets were linked to increased inflammatory markers in the hippocampus, a critical region involved in memory. Obesity-related inflammatory changes have been found in the human brain. Ongoing work examines interventions to prevent or reverse diet-induced cognitive impairments.

In particular, evidence in animals and human subjects that repeated consumption of HF or HF and sugar (HFS) diets leads to specific impairments in the functioning of the hippocampus, which underpin the consequent changes in cognition is summarised. These findings lead into the vicious cycle model (VCM), which suggests that these cognitive changes have knock-on negative effects for future appetite control, and evidence that altered hippocampal function is also associated with impaired appetite control is explored. The review concludes that there is consistent evidence in the animal literature and emerging evidence from human studies that supports this VCM. It is also noted, however, that to date studies lack the nutritional specificity needed to be able to translate these basic research findings into clear nutritional effects, and concludes that there is an urgent need for additional research to clarify the precise nature of the apparent effects of consuming HFS diets on cognition."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "While research in this area is growing, our knowledge of obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and brain alterations has not yet been synthesized.", "answer_start": 256}], "question": "Is obesity related to cognitive decline?", "id": "5c0e838b133db5eb7800002e_012", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Obesity is a significant contemporary health concern that carries wide-ranging implications for society, as well as for individual health and well-being.

All the patients had a viral load of more than 1000 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter. After a 7-day control period in which patients continued to receive their current therapy, a loading dose of 2000 mg of ibalizumab was infused; the viral load was quantified 7 days later. Through week 25 of the study, patients received 800 mg of ibalizumab every 14 days, combined with an individually optimized background regimen including at least one fully active agent. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a decrease in viral load of at least 0.5 log10 copies per milliliter from baseline (day 7) to day 14.RESULTS: A total of 31 patients completed the study. The mean baseline viral load was 4.5 log10 copies per milliliter, and the mean CD4 count was 150 per microliter.

We examined whether laboratory accuracy improves with longer EQA participation and whether IQA remediation is effective.METHODS: Laboratory accuracy, defined by the measurement residuals from trial sample medians, was measured on four outcomes: both CD4+ absolute counts (cells/μL) and percentages; and CD8+ absolute counts (cells/μL) and percentages. Three laboratory categories were defined: IQA monitored (n = 116), United Kingdom/non-DAIDS (n = 137), and non-DAIDS/non-UK (n = 1034). For absolute count outcomes, the groups were subdivided into single platform and dual platform users.RESULTS: Increasing EQA duration was found to be associated with increasing accuracy for all groups in all four lymphocyte subsets (P < 0.0001). In the percentage outcomes, the typical IQA group laboratory improved faster than laboratories from the other two groups (P < 0.005). No difference in the overall rate of improvement was found between groups for absolute count outcomes.

Based on these results, immunophenotypes were distinguished by principal components analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis was used to classify SLE patients into subgroups.RESULTS: The proportions of Treg and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells were higher in SLE patients than in healthy controls, whereas Th1 and Th17 cell proportions did not differ. Proportions of class-switched memory B cells and IgD-CD27- B cells were increased in SLE patients as well. The largest difference compared to the control group was observed in the proportion of plasmablasts, which was higher in SLE patients and correlated with disease activity as assessed with the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group index. PCA indicated that the immunophenotype of SLE patients consisted of abnormalities of the T and B cell axes. Cluster analysis showed that the SLE patients could be stratified into 3 subgroups (with high proportions of plasmablasts in all groups): patients who did not show the characteristic features (T cell-independent group), patients with a high percentage of Tfh cells (Tfh-dominant group), and patients with a high percentage of memory Treg cells (Treg-dominant group).

We correlated FC with surgical diagnoses and evaluated the frequency of repeat IHC testing.RESULTS: Repetitive immunophenotyping was common; overall, 85% of cases had at least one marker repeated. Concordant cases were significantly less likely to have markers repeated than discordant cases. Of concordant B cell malignancies, 57% represented recurrent disease; however, repeat marker usage was not decreased as compared to new diagnoses. The most frequently repeated markers were CD3, CD5, CD10, and CD20.CONCLUSIONS: We propose that in concordant cases, CD5 and CD10 should not be repeated by IHC; this would decrease the use of these markers by 80% and 76%, respectively.

Emicizumab does not require activation by thrombin, and its effect on shortening the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is much greater than that of FVIII. Therefore, the APTT has limited utility in hemophilia A (HA) patients treated with emicizumab. Aim To evaluate the global coagulation potential of emicizumab. Methods Clot waveform analysis (CWA) with prothrombin time (PT)/APTT mixed reagents was used to define hemostatic monitoring protocols in HA patients. A modified parameter, adjusted-|min1| (Ad|min1|), was developed. Maximum and minimum percentage transmittance were defined as 100% and 0% in the precoagulation and postcoagulation phases, respectively. Ad|min1| was calculated as an index of the maximum velocity of the coagulation process. Results Ad|min1| obtained with mixed-trigger reagent (PT/APTT/buffer, 1 : 15 : 135) in the presence of emicizumab optimally corresponded to the conversion rate estimated in animals; 0.2-0.4 IU dL-1 equivalent FVIII per 1 μg mL-1 emicizumab). Ex vivo addition of emicizumab to HA plasma with or without inhibitors resulted in concentration-dependent increases in Ad|min1|, with some individual variations. The addition of various concentrations of FVIII to HA plasma mixed with emicizumab resulted in dose-dependent increases in Ad|min1|. Similarly, mixtures of activated prothrombin complex concentrate and emicizumab added to HA plasma resulted in dose-dependent increases in Ad|min1|. In contrast, enhanced coagulation potential appeared to be better defined by the clot time than by Ad|min1| in experiments using recombinant activated FVII.

Results The combined anti-idiotype mAbs (2000 nm each) eliminated the effects of emicizumab on APTTs of HA plasmas without or with inhibitor by competitive inhibition of antibody binding to FIX(a)/FX(a).

Methods Therapeutic concentrations of SIA (20-600 nm) alone or with aPCC (0.05-1 U mL-1 ), isolated aPCC components or rFVIIa (0.88-5.25 μg mL-1 ) were tested for TG and compared with reference ranges for healthy donor plasma. Coagulation of FVIII-inhibited blood was determined with a widely established method, i.e. rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), and confirmed with the Total Thrombus-formation Analysis System. Results and conclusions SIA (600 nm) or aPCC (0.5 U mL-1 ) alone resulted in peak thrombin levels of 21.4 nm and 38.6 nm, respectively, both of which are lower than normal (83.7 ± 29.8 nm). SIA plus aPCC (0.5 U mL-1 ) increased the peak thrombin level 17-fold over SIA alone, exceeding the reference plasma value by 4.2-fold. This hypercoagulable effect occurred with 600 nmSIA combined with as little as 0.25 U mL-1 aPCC, confirmed by ROTEM. FIX was the main driver for enhanced TG. SIA plus rFVIIa (1.75 μg mL-1 ) induced a 1.8-fold increase in the peak thrombin level in platelet-rich plasma, but it did not reach the normal range. These in vitro experiments demonstrate excessive TG after administration of a combination of aPCC and SIA at clinically relevant doses.

Depletion of Esco2 by morpholino microinjection leads to the precocious polar body extrusion, the escape of metaphase I arrest induced by nocodazole treatment and the loss of BubR1 from kinetochores, indicative of inactivated SAC. Furthermore, depletion of Esco2 causes a severely impaired spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, accompanied by the remarkably elevated incidence of defective kinetochore-microtubule attachments which consequently lead to the generation of aneuploid eggs. Notably, we find that the involvement of Esco2 in SAC and kinetochore functions is mediated by its binding to histone H4 and acetylation of H4K16 both in vivo and in vitro.

L-leucine treatment partially rescued translational efficiency of ribosomal subunits, translation initiation factors, snoRNA production, and mitochondrial function in RBS cells, consistent with these processes being mTORC1 controlled. In contrast, other genes are differentially expressed independent of L-leucine treatment, including imprinted genes such as H19 and GTL2, miRNAs regulated by GTL2, HOX genes, and genes in nucleolar associated domains.CONCLUSIONS: Our study distinguishes between gene expression changes in RBS cells that are TOR dependent and those that are independent.

In animal models, overexpression of GDF15 leads to a lean phenotype, hypophagia and other improvements in metabolic parameters, suggesting that recombinant GDF15 protein could potentially be used in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

In stressed or disease conditions, however, animals use alternative neuronal pathways to adapt to the metabolic challenges of altered energy demand. Recent studies have identified brain areas outside the hypothalamus that are activated under these 'non-homeostatic' conditions, but the molecular nature of the peripheral signals and brain-localized receptors that activate these circuits remains elusive. Here we identify glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) as a brainstem-restricted receptor for growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). GDF15 regulates food intake, energy expenditure and body weight in response to metabolic and toxin-induced stresses; we show that Gfral knockout mice are hyperphagic under stressed conditions and are resistant to chemotherapy-induced anorexia and body weight loss. GDF15 activates GFRAL-expressing neurons localized exclusively in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the mouse brainstem. It then triggers the activation of neurons localized within the parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala, which constitute part of the 'emergency circuit' that shapes feeding responses to stressful conditions. GDF15 levels increase in response to tissue stress and injury, and elevated levels are associated with body weight loss in numerous chronic human diseases. By isolating GFRAL as the receptor for GDF15-induced anorexia and weight loss, we identify a mechanistic basis for the non-homeostatic regulation of neural circuitry by a peripheral signal associated with tissue damage and stress.

Identification of ADP-ribosylation sites is required to discern the molecular mechanisms regulated by this modification. This motivated us to develop a computational tool for the prediction of ADP-ribosylated sites.Results: Here, we present ADPredict, the first dedicated computational tool for the prediction of ADP-ribosylated aspartic and glutamic acids. This predictive algorithm is based on (i) physicochemical properties, (ii) in-house designed secondary structure-related descriptors and (iii) three-dimensional features of a set of human ADP-ribosylated proteins that have been reported in the literature. ADPredict was developed using principal component analysis and machine learning techniques; its performance was evaluated both internally via intensive bootstrapping and in predicting two external experimental datasets. It outperformed the only other available ADP-ribosylation prediction tool, ModPred. Moreover, a novel secondary structure descriptor, HM-ratio, was introduced and successfully contributed to the model development, thus representing a promising tool for bioinformatics studies, such as PTM prediction.Availability and implementation: ADPredict is freely available at www.ADPredict.net.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " We retrospectively analyzed 93 consecutive single-pregnancy patients who underwent cesarean section with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia.

Recent investigations have demonstrated functional adrenoreceptors on the cellular mediators of cutaneous wound healing and NE-induced phenotypic alterations in immune cells have been demonstrated in vitro. Despite this, there is little description of how NE might alter the phases of wound healing in vivo. The purpose of this study was to compare cutaneous wound healing in norepinephrine-intact and norepinephrine-depleted mice.METHODS: Norepinephrine-depleted (NED) mice were generated by chemical axotomy with 6-hydroxydopamine and compared with norepinephrine-intact (NEI) animals (n = 6-12 per group, per time point). Using an excisional wound model, neutrophil recruitment was measured by myeloperoxidase assay. Macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis were measured by immunohistochemistry and re-epithelialization was determined histologically. The development of incisional wound disruption strength was determined over time. Finally, macrophage scavenger function was assessed by an in vitro latex bead phagocytosis assay.RESULTS: Wounds from NEI mice demonstrated greater neutrophil infiltration than NED wounds (24, 72 hours; p < 0.05). Wound macrophage recruitment was initially higher in NEI animals (24 hours, p < 0.05), but was eventually surpassed by that of NED animals (120 hours, p < 0.05). Angiogenesis was decreased while re-epithelialization was accelerated in NEI animals (p < 0.05). Wound disruption strength and macrophage scavenger function were unaltered between NED and NEI mice.CONCLUSIONS: Norepinephrine modulates the inflammatory and proliferative phases of wound healing in a temporally defined, cell-specific manner. By increasing recruitment of innate immune cells and expediting wound closure, norepinephrine appears to play a protective role in defense against infection."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " We developed a scanning cytometry-based high-throughput assay of macrophage phagocytosis that quantitates bound and internalized unopsonized latex beads.

Mice with genetic deletions of scavenger receptors, such as SR-A and MARCO, are susceptible to infection or inflammation from inhaled pathogens or dusts. However, the signaling pathways required for scavenger receptor-mediated phagocytosis of unopsonized particles have not been characterized.METHODS: We developed a scanning cytometry-based high-throughput assay of macrophage phagocytosis that quantitates bound and internalized unopsonized latex beads. This assay allowed the testing of a panel of signaling inhibitors which have previously been shown to target opsonin-dependent phagocytosis for their effect on unopsonized bead uptake by human in vitro-derived alveolar macrophage-like cells. The non-selective scavenger receptor inhibitor poly(I) and the actin destabilizer cytochalasin D were used to validate the assay and caused near complete abrogation of bead binding and internalization, respectively.RESULTS: Microtubule destabilization using nocodazole dramatically inhibited bead internalization. Internalization was also significantly reduced by inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (genistein and herbimycin A), protein kinase C (staurosporine, chelerythrine chloride and Gö 6976), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (LY294002 and wortmannin), and the JNK and ERK pathways.

Here, we generated and analyzed mice with a targeted mutation of the active site selenocysteine of Gpx4 (Gpx4_U46S). Mice homozygous for Gpx4_U46S died at the same embryonic stage (E7.5) as Gpx4(-/-) embryos as expected. Surprisingly, male mice heterozygous for Gpx4_U46S presented subfertility. Subfertility was manifested in a reduced number of litters from heterozygous breeding and an impairment of spermatozoa to fertilize oocytes in vitro. Morphologically, sperm isolated from heterozygous Gpx4_U46S mice revealed many structural abnormalities particularly in the spermatozoa midpiece due to improper oxidation and polymerization of sperm capsular proteins and malformation of the mitochondrial capsule surrounding and stabilizing sperm mitochondria. These findings are reminiscent of sperm isolated from selenium-deprived rodents or from mice specifically lacking mitochondrial Gpx4. Due to a strongly facilitated incorporation of Ser in the polypeptide chain as compared with selenocysteine at the UGA codon, expression of the catalytically inactive Gpx4_U46S was found to be strongly increased. Because the stability of the mitochondrial capsule of mature spermatozoa depends on the moonlighting function of Gpx4 both as an enzyme oxidizing capsular protein thiols and as a structural protein, tightly controlled expression of functional Gpx4 emerges as a key for full male fertility."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "the major selenoprotein expressed by germ cells in the testis, the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx/GPx4) ", "answer_start": 951}], "question": "Is phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase a selenoprotein?", "id": "5c5f22951a4c55d80b00001d_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Spermatogenesis is a complex process of male germ cells proliferation and maturation from diploid spermatogonia, through meiosis, to mature haploid spermatozoa.

Treatments include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and alternative therapies. Alternative therapies for excoriation disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviors include yoga, aerobic exercise, acupuncture, biofeedback, hypnosis, and inositol and N-acetylcysteine, among others. Objective • This review article intended to review the current literature on the alternative therapies to provide a brief update on their benefits for the treatment of excoriation disorder for use in conjunction with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in the management of a challenging group of patients. Design • This review (focusing on literature published in the last 15 y, selected from a search of PubMed) critically considers the evidence for the use of alternative therapies in the treatment of excoriation disorder. Setting • This review was conducted at the National University of Asunción (San Lorenzo, Paraguay). Results • Results for yoga were as follows: This technique may influence the structure and functioning of the areas of emotional processing involved in the pathophysiology of excoriation disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania. Although still limited, the current research team's use of yoga as a treatment has given useful results. Results for aerobic exercise were as follows: People suffering from excoriation disorder and other-body focused repetitive behaviors generally have a worsening of their behaviors in times of negative mood and anxiety. As exercise has qualities that allow individuals to improve their mood and reduce their anxiety, it is likely that it also can help reduce behaviors like hair pulling or scratching, and it should be considered to be an adjunctive therapy. Results for acupuncture were as follows: The mechanism of action of acupuncture increases serotonergic activity and releases endorphins in the hypothalamus and limbic region, which could be beneficial in patients with trichotillomania and excoriation disorder. Results for biofeedback were as follows: Several case reports have suggested the value of biofeedback in reducing tics, which bear some psychophysiological similarities to body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania and excoriation disorder. Results for hypnosis were as follows: When used as a channel for other types of interventions, such as psychotherapy, hypnosis can help counteract the stress that triggers the picking behaviors in some patients. Results for inositol and N-acetylcysteine were as follows: Although more research is needed, these are promising drugs that may be helpful in reducing the picking behavior.

We detect several potential disease-causing regulatory effects, with a strong enrichment for immunity-related conditions, consistent with the nature of the cell line tested (LCLs).

The clinical manifestations of NP-C include hepatosplenomegaly, neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Current diagnosis for NP-C is based on observation of the accumulated cholesterol in fibroblasts of affected individuals, using an invasive and time expensive test, called Filipin staining. Lately, two metabolites that are markedly increased in NP-C patients are arising as biomarkers for this disease screening: 7-ketocholesterol and cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol, both oxidized cholesterol products.OBJECTIVE: In this work, we aimed to evaluate the performance of cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol analysis for the screening and monitoring of NPC patients, correlating it with chitotriosidase levels, Filipin staining and molecular analysis. It was investigated 76 non-treated individuals with NP-C suspicion and also 7 patients with previous NP-C diagnosis under treatment with miglustat, in order to verify the cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol value as a tool for therapy monitoring.RESULTS: Considering molecular assay as golden standard, it was verified that cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol analysis presented 88% of sensitivity, 96.08% of specificity, a positive and negative predictive value calculated in 91.67% and 94.23%, respectively, for the diagnosis of NP-C. Chitotriosidase levels were increased in patients with positive molecular analysis for NP-C. For Filipin staining, it was found 1 false positive, 7 false negative and 24 inconclusive cases, showing that this assay has important limitations for NP-C diagnosis. Besides, we found a significant decrease in cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol concentrations in NP-C patients under therapy with miglustat when compared to non-treated patients.CONCLUSION: Taken together, the present data show that cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol analysis has a high potential to be an important NP-C screening assay, and also can be used for therapy monitorization with miglustat in NP-C patients.Copyright © 2017 ISDN.

When full-length human Nup153 is expressed in BHK cells, it accumulates appropriately at the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. Targeting information for Nup153 resides in the NH2-terminal domain since this region of the molecule can direct an ordinarily cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase, to the nuclear face of the nuclear pore complex. Overexpression of Nup153 results in the dramatic accumulation of nuclear poly (A)+ RNA, suggesting an inhibition of RNA export from the nucleus. This is not due to a general decline in nucleocytoplasmic transport or to occlusion or loss of nuclear pore complexes since nuclear protein import is unaffected. While overexpression of certain Nup153 constructs was found to result in the formation of unusual intranuclear membrane arrays, this structural phenotype could not be correlated with the effects on poly (A)+ RNA distribution. The RNA trafficking defect was, however, dependent upon the Nup153 COOH-terminal domain which contains most of the XFXFG repeats.

GAPDH export in these Gram-negative pathogens depends on the external medium, is not mediated by vesicles and leads to an extracellular active enzyme. Non-pathogenic E. coli strains do not secrete GAPDH. Two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis showed that in E. coli GAPDH is present at least in two major forms with different isoelectric points. Of these forms, the more basic is secreted. Purified GAPDH was found to bind human plasminogen and fibrinogen in Far-Western blot and ELISA-based assays. In addition, GAPDH remained associated with colonic Caco-2 epithelial cells after adhesion of EHEC or EPEC.

A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or volume (maximum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL and total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL). Liposomal clearances of the two drugs were highly correlated and 1000-fold smaller than published non-encapsulated values supporting prolonged encapsulation in the liposome.CONCLUSIONS: The PK model demonstrates prolonged exposure to cytarabine and daunorubicin without increases in non-hematologic toxicity that indicates retention of the drugs within the liposome.

By use of a LacI/LacO reporter system, we were able to assess nucleoporin (Nup) interactions, show that they occur with a high level of specificity, and identify nucleoporins sufficient for initiation of the complex process of NPC assembly in vivo. Eleven nucleoporins from different sub-complexes were fused to LacI-CFP and transfected separately into a human cell line containing a stably integrated LacO DNA array. The LacI-Nup fusion proteins, which bound to the array, were examined for their ability to recruit endogenous nucleoporins to the intranuclear LacO site. Many could recruit nucleoporins of the same sub-complex and a number could also recruit other sub-complexes. Strikingly, Nup133 and Nup107 of the Nup107/160 subcomplex and Nup153 and Nup50 of the nuclear pore basket recruited a near full complement of nucleoporins to the LacO array. Furthermore, Nup133 and Nup153 efficiently targeted the LacO array to the nuclear periphery.

Study procedures were performed using a mix of in-person and remote assessments. Primary outcome was safety and tolerability. Secondary outcome was efficacy, with survival as the principal measure.

Thirty-six (19 placebo, 17 arimoclomol) were included in the prespecified intent-to-treat analysis. Apart from respiratory function, groups were generally well-balanced at baseline. Adverse events occurred infrequently, and were usually mild and deemed unlikely or not related to study drug.

GBA mutations commonly affect GCase function by perturbing its protein homeostasis rather than its catalytic activity. Heat shock proteins are well known cytoprotective molecules with functions in protein homeostasis and lysosomal function and their manipulation has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for GD. The investigational drug arimoclomol, which is in phase II/III clinical trials, is a well-characterized HSP amplifier and has been extensively clinically tested. Importantly, arimoclomol efficiently crosses the blood-brain-barrier presenting an opportunity to target the neurological manifestations of GD, which remains without a disease-modifying therapy.METHODS: We used a range of biological and biochemical in vitro assays to assess the effect of arimoclomol on GCase activity in ex vivo systems of primary fibroblasts and neuronal-like cells from GD patients.FINDINGS: We found that arimoclomol induced relevant HSPs such as ER-resident HSP70 (BiP) and enhanced the folding, maturation, activity, and correct cellular localization of mutated GCase across several genotypes including the common L444P and N370S mutations in primary cells from GD patients. These effects where recapitulated in a human neuronal model of GD obtained by differentiation of multipotent adult stem cells.INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate the potential of HSP-targeting therapies in GCase-deficiencies and strongly support the clinical development of arimoclomol as a potential therapeutic option for the neuronopathic forms of GD.FUNDING: The research was funded by Orphazyme A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Although the precise disease pathophysiology is largely unknown, it appears to be related to abnormal accumulation of the pathogenic androgen receptor protein within the nucleus, leading to disruption of cellular processes. Using a mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy that exhibits many of the characteristic features of the human disease, in vivo physiological assessment of muscle function revealed that mice with the pathogenic expansion of the androgen receptor develop a motor deficit characterized by a reduction in muscle force, abnormal muscle contractile characteristics, loss of functional motor units and motor neuron degeneration.

We investigated the outbreak to identify potential exposures that facilitated measles transmission, assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) and vaccination coverage (VC), and recommend prevention and control measures.METHODS: For this investigation, a probable case was defined as onset of fever and generalized maculopapular rash, plus ≥1 of the following symptoms: Coryza, conjunctivitis, or cough. A confirmed case was defined as a probable case plus identification of measles-specific IgM in serum. For case-finding, we reviewed patients' medical records and conducted in-home patient examination. In a case-control study, we compared exposures of case-patients and controls matched by age and village of residence. For children aged 9 m-5y, we estimated VC using the percent of children among the controls who had been vaccinated against measles, and calculated VE using the formula, VE = 1 - ORM-H, where ORM-H was the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio associated with having a measles vaccination history.RESULTS: We identified 213 probable cases with onset between April and August, 2015. Of 23 blood specimens collected, 78% were positive for measles-specific IgM. Measles attack rate was highest in the youngest age-group, 0-5y (13/10,000), and decreased as age increased. The epidemic curve indicated sustained propagation in the community. Of the 50 case-patients and 200 controls, 42% of case-patients and 12% of controls visited health centers during their likely exposure period (ORM-H = 6.1; 95% CI = 2.7-14).

After more than 3 decades of research, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms remain incompletely understood and important questions remain regarding the evaluation and management of these patients. The purpose of this review is to analyze the recent literature and improve our understanding of certain key clinical aspects.RECENT FINDINGS: Growing body of evidence highlights the usefulness of CT perfusion scans in the diagnosis of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Hypervolemia leads to worse cardiopulmonary outcomes and does not improve DCI. The traditional triple H therapy is falling out of favor with hemodynamic augmentation alone now considered the mainstay of medical management. Randomized controlled trials have shown that simvastatin and intravenous magnesium do not prevent DCI or improve functional outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).

The secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of publicity efforts on uptake of The Ottawa Rules app.METHODS: The Ottawa Rules app was developed and publicly released for free on iOS and Android operating systems in April 2016. Local and national news and academic media coverage coincided with app release. This study was conducted at a large tertiary trauma care center in Ottawa, Canada. The study was advertised through posters and electronically by email. Emergency department clinicians were approached in person to enroll via in-app consent for a 1-month study during which time they were encouraged to use the app when evaluating patients with suspected knee, foot, or neck injuries. A 23-question survey was administered at the end of the study period via email to determine self-reported frequency, perceived ease of use of the app, and participant Technology Readiness Index scores.RESULTS: A total of 108 emergency department clinicians completed the study including 42 nurses, 33 residents, 20 attending physicians, and 13 medical students completing emergency department rotations. The median Technology Readiness Index for this group was 3.56, indicating a moderate degree of openness for technological adoption. The majority of survey respondents indicated favorable receptivity to the app including finding it helpful to applying the rules (73/108, 67.6%), that they would recommend the app to colleagues (81/108, 75.0%), and that they would continue using the app (73/108, 67.6%). Feedback from study participants highlighted a desire for access to more clinical decision rules and a higher degree of interactivity of the app. Between April 21, 2016, and June 1, 2017, The Ottawa Rules app was downloaded approximately 4000 times across 89 countries.CONCLUSIONS: We have found The Ottawa Rules app to be an effective means to disseminate the Ottawa Ankle Rules, Ottawa Knee Rule, and Canadian C-Spine Rule among all levels of emergency department clinicians.

This is in contrast to a previous prospective study which showed that this rule yielded only 87% sensitivity.OBJECTIVE: It is important to further investigate the LRAR and compare them with the already validated Ottawa Ankle Rules (OAR) to potentially curb healthcare costs and decrease unnecessary radiation exposure without compromising diagnostic accuracy.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 980 qualifying patients ages 12months to 18years presenting with ankle injury to a commonly staffed 310 bed children's hospital and auxiliary site pediatric emergency department.RESULTS: There were 28 high-risk fractures identified. The Ottawa Ankle Rules had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 87.7-100), specificity of 33.1% (95% CI 30.1-36.2), and would have reduced the number of ankle radiographs ordered by 32.1%. The Low Risk Ankle Rules had a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI 85.7-96), specificity of 64.9% (95% CI 61.8-68), and would have reduced the number of ankle radiographs ordered by 63.1%. The latter rule missed 4 high-risk fractures.CONCLUSION: The Low Risk Ankle Rules may not be sensitive enough for use in Pediatric Emergency Departments, while the Ottawa Ankle Rules again demonstrated 100% sensitivity.

However, still 50% of patients with ankle injuries undergo unnecessary radiography. Compared to the OAR, the Bernese ankle rule (BAR) has an acclaimed 84% reduction in radiography without loss of sensitivity. The primary aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of both rules. Furthermore, the ability of triage nurses to accurately interpret the BAR was assessed.METHODS: Participants were assessed by both the ED resident and the triage nurse, applying the OAR and the BAR. After standardised data collection, ankle and foot radiographs were performed in all patients. Sensitivity and specificity of both tests applied by both observers were obtained and compared by McNemar's test. Reproducibility was calculated with Cohen's kappa.RESULTS: A total of 203 patients with ankle trauma were included. For the OAR obtained by the ED residents, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.97 and 0.29, respectively. For the BAR, the sensitivity and specificity of the ED residents were 0.69 and 0.45, respectively. For the triage nurses, the OAR sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 and 0.25, respectively. The BAR sensitivity and specificity for the nurses were 0.86 and 0.40, respectively. The reproducibility of the OAR was 0.45, and for the BAR, it was 0.48.CONCLUSION: Both rules showed comparable reproducibility. Although the BAR showed a superior specificity compared to the OAR, its sensitivity was too low to promote clinical use. The triage nurses demonstrated too low sensitivity on both rules to allow safe application.

We investigated associations between each cell type and survival and response to chemotherapy, modelling cellular proportions as quartiles. We found that tumours with little or no immune infiltration were associated with different survival patterns according to oestrogen receptor (ER) status. In ER-negative disease, tumours lacking immune infiltration were associated with the poorest prognosis, whereas in ER-positive disease, they were associated with intermediate prognosis. Of the cell subsets investigated, T regulatory cells and M0 and M2 macrophages emerged as the most strongly associated with poor outcome, regardless of ER status. Among ER-negative tumours, CD8+ T cells (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98; p = 0.02) and activated memory T cells (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97; p = 0.01) were associated with favourable outcome. T follicular helper cells (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% CI 1.14-1.57; p < 0.001) and memory B cells (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.0-1.39; p = 0.04) were associated with pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-negative disease, suggesting a role for humoral immunity in mediating response to cytotoxic therapy. Unsupervised clustering analysis using immune cell proportions revealed eight subgroups of tumours, largely defined by the balance between M0, M1, and M2 macrophages, with distinct survival patterns by ER status and associations with patient age at diagnosis. The main limitations of this study are the use of diverse platforms for measuring gene expression, including some not previously used with CIBERSORT, and the combined analysis of different forms of follow-up across studies.CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in the cellular composition of the immune infiltrate in breast tumours appear to exist, and these differences are likely to be important determinants of both prognosis and response to treatment. In particular, macrophages emerge as a possible target for novel therapies.

Germline APOBEC3B deletion is more common in East Asian women and confers a modest risk to breast cancer in both East Asian and Caucasian women. Analysis of tumour samples from women of European descent has shown that germline APOBEC3B deletion is associated with an increased propensity to develop somatic mutations and with an enrichment for immune response-related gene sets. However, this has not been examined in Asian tumour samples, where population differences in genetic and dietary factors may have an impact on the immune system.METHODS: In this study, we determined the prevalence of germline APOBEC3B deletion and its association with breast cancer risk in a cross-sectional hospital-based Asian multi-ethnic cohort of 1451 cases and 1442 controls from Malaysia. We compared gene expression profiles of breast cancers arising from APOBEC3B deletion carriers and non-carriers using microarray analyses. Finally, we characterised the overall abundance of tumour-infiltrating immune cells in breast cancers from TCGA and METABRIC using ESTIMATE and relative frequency of 22 immune cell subsets in breast cancers from METABRIC using CIBERSORT.RESULTS: The minor allelic frequency of APOBEC3B deletion was estimated to be 0.35, 0.42 and 0.16 in female populations of Chinese, Malay and Indian descent, respectively, and that germline APOBEC3B deletion was associated with breast cancer risk with odds ratios of 1.23 (95 % CI: [1.05, 1.44]) for one-copy deletion and 1.38 (95 % CI: [1.10, 1.74]) for two-copy deletion compared to women with no deletion. Germline APOBEC3B deletion was not associated with any clinicopathologic features or the expression of any APOBEC family members but was associated with immune response-related gene sets (FDR q values < 0.05). Analysis of breast cancers from METABRIC revealed breast cancers from APOBEC3B deletion carriers to have significantly higher abundance of tumour-infiltrating immune cells (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggests that tumour-infiltrating immune cells may be an important feature of breast cancers arising in women with APOBEC3B germline deletion, and that this may be of particular interest in Asian women where the germline deletion is more common."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In this chapter, we provide a primer on the CIBERSORT method and illustrate its use for characterizing TILs in tumor samples profiled by microarray or RNA-Seq.", "answer_start": 858}], "question": "What is CIBERSORT used for?", "id": "5c6ffde47c78d69471000059_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) are an integral component of the tumor microenvironment and have been found to correlate with prognosis and response to therapy.

Considering the fact that immune responses are heterogenous and that the clinical outcome could be influenced by the interplay of various immune cell types, it is imperative to evaluate multiple intra-tumoral immune cell types in the same set of patients. Objective: To evaluate the individual and combined effects of diverse intra-tumoral immune cell types on recurrence after complete surgical resection in early stage lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: We obtained NCBI GEO datasets for lung adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent histological subtype of NSCLC and re-analyzed the gene expression data of 292 patients with early stage cancer (IA/IB). CIBERSORT was used to resolve 22 immune cell types from the tumor transcriptomes. Survival analysis was carried out to assess the effect of immune cell types and genes associated with recurrence. Results: Out of the 22 cell types, a high proportion of Tregs and monocyte-macrophages in the tumors were associated with significantly increased probability of recurrence. Conversely, increased proportion of non-Treg CD4+ T cells and plasma cells were associated with a lower probability of recurrence. The higher expression of CCL20 (which can direct the migration of cells of B cell lineage), XCL1 (associated with prototypical Th1 responses) and the immunoglobulin chains IGHV4.34 and IGLV6.57 were associated with a significantly lower probability of recurrence. Importantly, the intra-tumoral immune phenotype comprising these four cell types varied among patients and differentially associated with recurrence depending on net levels of positive and negative prognostic factors. Despite a high level of intra-tumoral plasma cells, a concomitant high level of monocyte-macrophages reduced the freedom from recurrence from ~80 to ~50% at 80 months (p < 0.05). Furthermore, stratification of the patients on the basis of a score estimated from the levels of four cell types enabled the identification of patients with significantly increased probability of recurrence (~50%) after surgery.

PK sampling was performed to measure olaratumab serum levels. PK data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed-effect modeling techniques using NONMEM®.RESULTS: The PKs of olaratumab were best described by a two-compartment PK model with linear clearance (CL). Patient body weight was found to have a significant effect on both CL and central volume of distribution (V 1), whereas tumor size significantly affected CL.

It is increasingly clear that the proteolytic shedding of transmembrane receptors impacts pathophysiology and drug response. Receptor substrates of sheddases include the cytokine receptors TNFR1 and IL6R; the Notch receptors; type-I and -III TGFβ receptors; receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as HER2, HER4, and VEGFR2; and, in particular, MET and TAM-family RTKs AXL and Mer (MerTK).

In the present study, we demonstrate that AXL, but not TYRO3 or MERTK, is efficiently and sequentially cleaved by α- and γ-secretases in various types of cancer cell lines. Proteolytic processing of AXL redirected signaling toward a secretase-mediated pathway, away from the classic, well-known, ligand-dependent canonical RTK signaling pathway. The AXL intracellular domain cleavage product, but not full-length AXL, was further shown to translocate into the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence that harbored a basic HRRKK motif. Of interest, we found that the γ-secretase-uncleavable AXL mutant caused an elevated chemoresistance in non-small-cell lung cancer cells.

In addition to functions in the cytosol, phosphoinositides are present in the nucleus, where they modulate several functions; however, the mechanism by which they directly regulate nuclear functions remains unknown. PIPKIs regulate cellular functions through interactions with protein partners, often PtdIns4,5P2 effectors, that target PIPKIs to discrete subcellular compartments, resulting in the spatial and temporal generation of PtdIns4,5P2 required for the regulation of specific signalling pathways. Therefore, to determine roles for nuclear PtdIns4,5P2 we set out to identify proteins that interacted with the nuclear PIPK, PIPKIalpha.

Like the related condition of migraine with aura, visual snow has been hypothesized to arise from abnormal neuronal responsiveness, as demonstrated by a lack of typical VEP habituation to repeated visual stimulation. Yet the exact neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Previous \"double-pulse\" experiments suggest that typical VEP habituation reflects disruptive gamma-band (50-70 Hz) neural oscillations, possibly driven by inhibitory interneurons. Given that migraine has been associated with reduced cortical inhibition, we propose here that visual snow may likewise reflect diminished inhibitory activity, resulting in decreased gamma power following initial visual stimulation and concomitant potentiation of the subsequent VEP response.METHODS: We compared VEP responses to double-pulse adaptation in a 22-year-old man with a 2-year history of visual snow versus a group of age- and gender-matched controls (N = 5). The patient does not have a comorbid diagnosis of episodic migraine or migraine with aura, and controls had no personal or family history of migraine.RESULTS: In contrast to the pattern of habituation observed in controls, visual snow was associated with persistent potentiation of the VEP response. Consistent with our predictions, time-frequency analysis revealed reduced gamma-band power following the initial stimulus in visual snow relative to controls.CONCLUSIONS: These results support an antagonistic interplay between gamma power and rapid neural adaptation, shedding new light on the neural mechanisms of VEP potentiation in visual snow.© 2017 American Headache Society."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "RECENT FINDINGS: Visual snow is a condition where patients see constant, innumerable flickering dots throughout the visual field, similar to \"TV static.\"", "answer_start": 377}], "question": "Describe symptoms of the Visual snow syndrome.", "id": "5c72f9847c78d69471000081_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review illustrative case descriptions of both primary and secondary visual snow from our clinic.

Sixty percent of patients with VSS also experience migraine, with or without aura. This entity often is considered psychogenic in nature, to the detriment of the patient's best interests, but the high frequency of similar visual symptoms argues for an organic deficit. The purpose of this review is to clarify VSS as a true entity and elaborate the nature of individual symptoms and their relationship to each other.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The literature was reviewed with specific regard to the clinical presentation and psychophysical, neurophysiological, and functional imaging studies in patients with defined visual disturbances that comprise VSS.RESULTS: Consideration of the individual symptoms suggests that multiple factors are potentially involved in the development of VSS, including subcortical network malfunction and cortical hyperexcitation. Although there is substantial overlap between VSS and migraine syndromes in terms of co-occurring symptoms, both neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies provide substantial evidence of separate abnormalities of processing, supporting these as separate syndromes.CONCLUSIONS: VSS is likely associated with either hyperactive visual cortices or, alternatively, impaired processing of simultaneous afferent information projecting to cortex. VSS likely results from widespread disturbance of sensory processing resulting in sensory misperception. There may be a number of syndromes associated with impaired sensory processing resulting in sensory misperception, including migraine, persistent perceptual postural dizziness, and tinnitus, which overlap with VSS.

A complete ophthalmological investigation, including binocular fundoscopy, was performed in all patients. Furthermore, best corrected visual acuity, perimetry, binocular functions, colour vision (D15-test), full-field ERG, pattern-reversal VEP and SD-OCT images of macula and optic nerve (RNFL) were analysed. Results Visual acuity of at least 1.0 and normal findings for all further investigations were observed in all patients. The following additional visual symptoms were identified: illusionary palinopsia (n = 6), disturbance of night vision (n = 5), positive light phenomena (n = 7).

FfIBP is an ice-binding protein encoded by the Antarctic bacterium Flavobacterium frigoris PS1. The X-ray crystal structure of FfIBP was determined to 2.1 Å resolution to gain insight into its ice-binding mechanism. The refined structure of FfIBP shows an intramolecular disulfide bond, and analytical ultracentrifugation and analytical size-exclusion chromatography show that it behaves as a monomer in solution. Sequence alignments and structural comparisons of IBPs allowed two groups of IBPs to be defined, depending on sequence differences between the α2 and α4 loop regions and the presence of the disulfide bond. Although FfIBP closely resembles Leucosporidium (recently re-classified as Glaciozyma) IBP (LeIBP) in its amino-acid sequence, the thermal hysteresis (TH) activity of FfIBP appears to be tenfold higher than that of LeIBP. A comparison of the FfIBP and LeIBP structures reveals that FfIBP has different ice-binding residues as well as a greater surface area in the ice-binding site. Notably, the ice-binding site of FfIBP is composed of a T-A/G-X-T/N motif, which is similar to the ice-binding residues of hyperactive antifreeze proteins. Thus, it is proposed that the difference in TH activity between FfIBP and LeIBP may arise from the amino-acid composition of the ice-binding site, which correlates with differences in affinity and surface complementarity to the ice crystal. In conclusion, this study provides a molecular basis for understanding the antifreeze mechanism of FfIBP and provides new insights into the reasons for the higher TH activity of FfIBP compared with LeIBP."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Ice-binding proteins (IBPs) can bind to the ice crystal and inhibit its growth.

Here, we report the crystal structures of non-glycosylated LeIBP and glycosylated LeIBP at 1.57- and 2.43-Å resolution, respectively. Structural analysis of the LeIBPs revealed a dimeric right-handed β-helix fold, which is composed of three parts: a large coiled structural domain, a long helix region (residues 96-115 form a long α-helix that packs along one face of the β-helix), and a C-terminal hydrophobic loop region ((243)PFVPAPEVV(251)). Unexpectedly, the C-terminal hydrophobic loop region has an extended conformation pointing away from the body of the coiled structural domain and forms intertwined dimer interactions. In addition, structural analysis of glycosylated LeIBP with sugar moieties attached to Asn(185) provides a basis for interpreting previous biochemical analyses as well as the increased stability and secretion of glycosylated LeIBP. We also determined that the aligned Thr/Ser/Ala residues are critical for ice binding within the B face of LeIBP using site-directed mutagenesis. Although LeIBP has a common β-helical fold similar to that of canonical hyperactive antifreeze proteins, the ice-binding site is more complex and does not have a simple ice-binding motif.

A similar analysis was performed with two additional A*29:02-positive, ERAP1-concordant, cell lines expressing or not ERAP2. In both comparisons the presence of ERAP2 affected the following features of the A*29:02 peptidome: 1) Length, with increased amounts of peptides >9-mers, and 2) N-terminal residues, with less ERAP2-susceptible and more hydrophobic ones. The paradoxical effects on peptide length suggest that unproductive binding to ERAP2 might protect some peptides from ERAP1 over-trimming. The influence on N-terminal residues can be explained by a direct effect of ERAP2 on trimming, without ruling out and improved processing in concert with ERAP1. The alterations in the A*29:02 peptidome suggest that the association of ERAP2 with BSCR is through its effects on peptide processing.

Ferroptosis has recently been reported as a mechanism of iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death. However, ferroptosis in the heart is not well understood. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) protects the heart against pathological stimuli such as ischemia. To define the role of cardiac mTOR on cell survival in iron-mediated cell death, we examined cardiomyocyte (CM) cell viability under excess iron and ferroptosis conditions. Adult mouse CMs were isolated from cardiac-specific mTOR transgenic mice, cardiac-specific mTOR knockout mice, or control mice. CMs were treated with ferric iron [Fe(III)]-citrate, erastin, a class 1 ferroptosis inducer, or Ras-selective lethal 3 (RSL3), a class 2 ferroptosis inducer. Live/dead cell viability assays revealed that Fe(III)-citrate, erastin, and RSL3 induced cell death. Cotreatment with ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, inhibited cell death in all conditions. mTOR overexpression suppressed Fe(III)-citrate, erastin, and RSL3-induced cell death, whereas mTOR deletion exaggerated cell death in these conditions. 2',7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production showed that erastin-induced ROS production was significantly lower in mTOR transgenic versus control CMs. These findings suggest that ferroptosis is a significant type of cell death in CMs and that mTOR plays an important role in protecting CMs against excess iron and ferroptosis, at least in part, by regulating ROS production. Understanding the effects of mTOR in preventing iron-mediated cell death will provide a new therapy for patients with myocardial infarction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ferroptosis has recently been reported as a new form of iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death. However, ferroptosis in the heart is not well characterized.

BAY 11-7085 (BAY), which is a well-known IκBα inhibitor, suppressed viability in cancer cells via induction of ferroptotic death in an NF-κB-independent manner. Reactive oxygen species scavenging, relief of lipid peroxidation, replenishment of glutathione and thiol-containing agents, as well as iron chelation, rescued BAY-induced cell death. BAY upregulated a variety of Nrf2 target genes related to redox regulation, particularly heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Studies with specific inhibitors and shRNA interventions suggested that the hierarchy of induction is Nrf2-SLC7A11-HO-1. SLC7A11 inhibition by erastin, sulfasalazine, or shRNA interference sensitizes BAY-induced cell death. Overexperession of SLC7A11 attenuated BAY-inhibited cell viability. The ferroptotic process induced by hHO-1 overexpression further indicated that HO-1 is a key mediator of BAY-induced ferroptosis that operates through cellular redox regulation and iron accumulation. BAY causes compartmentalization of HO-1 into the nucleus and mitochondrion, and followed mitochondrial dysfunctions, leading to lysosome targeting for mitophagy. In this study, we first discovered that BAY induced ferroptosis via Nrf2-SLC7A11-HO-1 pathway and HO-1 is a key mediator by responding to the cellular redox status."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " To compare the outcome of per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) and laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for the treatment of esophageal achalasia", "answer_start": 10}], "question": "What disease is treated with Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy (LHM)?", "id": "5c536b857e3cb0e23100001c_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcome of per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) and laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for the treatment of esophageal achalasia.BACKGROUND: Over the last 2 decades, LHM has become the primary form of treatment in many centers.

The main outcomes measured were improvement of dysphagia and posttreatment gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Linear regression was used to model the effect of each procedure on the different outcomes.RESULTS: Fifty-three studies reported data on LHM (5834 patients), and 21 articles examined POEM (1958 patients).

Main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for diagnostic classification (dichotomous) of lesions by the CNN versus an international group of 58 dermatologists during level-I or -II of the reader study. Secondary end points included the dermatologists' diagnostic performance in their management decisions and differences in the diagnostic performance of dermatologists during level-I and -II of the reader study. Additionally, the CNN's performance was compared with the top-five algorithms of the 2016 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) challenge.Results: In level-I dermatologists achieved a mean (±standard deviation) sensitivity and specificity for lesion classification of 86.6% (±9.3%) and 71.3% (±11.2%), respectively. More clinical information (level-II) improved the sensitivity to 88.9% (±9.6%, P = 0.19) and specificity to 75.7% (±11.7%, P < 0.05). The CNN ROC curve revealed a higher specificity of 82.5% when compared with dermatologists in level-I (71.3%, P < 0.01) and level-II (75.7%, P < 0.01) at their sensitivities of 86.6% and 88.9%, respectively. The CNN ROC AUC was greater than the mean ROC area of dermatologists (0.86 versus 0.79, P < 0.01). The CNN scored results close to the top three algorithms of the ISBI 2016 challenge.Conclusions: For the first time we compared a CNN's diagnostic performance with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts.

In order to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers) can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data. First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper. This technique can ensure that our networks benefit from the performance gains achieved by increasing network depth. Then, we construct a fully convolutional residual network (FCRN) for accurate skin lesion segmentation, and further enhance its capability by incorporating a multi-scale contextual information integration scheme. Finally, we seamlessly integrate the proposed FCRN (for segmentation) and other very deep residual networks (for classification) to form a two-stage framework. This framework enables the classification network to extract more representative and specific features based on segmented results instead of the whole dermoscopy images, further alleviating the insufficiency of training data. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated on ISBI 2016 Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection Challenge dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the significant performance gains of the proposed framework, ranking the first in classification and the second in segmentation among 25 teams and 28 teams, respectively. This study corroborates that very deep CNNs with effective training mechanisms can be employed to solve complicated medical image analysis tasks, even with limited training data."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS", "answer_start": 307}], "question": "Which human disease is experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model for?", "id": "5c783d32d774d04240000004_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be initiated when myelin-specific T cells infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), triggering subsequent recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the CNS.

So far, whether ASI has curative effect on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, and how it affects the subsets of CD4+ T cells, as well as the underlying mechanism have not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, ASI was found to ameliorate the progression and hamper the recurrence of EAE effectively in the treatment regimens. It significantly reduced the demyelination and inflammatory infiltration of CNS in EAE mice by suppressing the percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells, which was closely associated with the inhibition of JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways. ASI also increased the percentage of Treg cells in spleen and CNS, which was accompanied by elevated Foxp3. However, in vitro experiments disclosed that ASI could regulate the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells but not Th1 cells. In addition, it induced the apoptosis of MOG-stimulated CD4+ T cells probably through modulating STAT3/Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathways.

In contrast, targeted imaging agents can identify patients with receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells, thus allowing appropriate selection of patients for personalized treatment with a desirable targeted therapeutic. The folate receptor (FR) has been identified as a new molecularly targeted entity, which is highly overexpressed on the surface of a spectrum of solid tumor cells, including ovarian, kidney, lung, brain, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, prostate, testicular, bladder, head and neck, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Folic acid conjugation is a novel approach for targeting FR-expressing tissues for personalized treatment. With the development of FRα-targeted therapies comes a concomitant prerequisite for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore, attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent, (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization. (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer.

In contrast, targeted imaging agents can identify patients with receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells, thus allowing appropriate selection of patients for personalized treatment with a desirable targeted therapeutic. The folate receptor (FR) has been identified as a new molecularly targeted entity, which is highly overexpressed on the surface of a spectrum of solid tumor cells, including ovarian, kidney, lung, brain, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, prostate, testicular, bladder, head and neck, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Folic acid conjugation is a novel approach for targeting FR-expressing tissues for personalized treatment. With the development of FRα-targeted therapies comes a concomitant prerequisite for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore, attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools frequently require invasive surgical biopsy.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is an important physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plays a critical role in fibrinolysis. PAI-1 expression is increased in both experimental APAP-induced liver injury and patients with acute liver failure. Prior studies have shown that PAI-1 prevents intrahepatic hemorrhage and mortality after APAP challenge, but the downstream mechanisms are not clear. We tested the hypothesis that PAI-1 limits liver-related morbidity after APAP challenge by reducing tPA-dependent fibrinolysis. Compared with APAP-challenged (300 mg/kg) wild-type mice, hepatic deposition of cross-linked fibrin was reduced, with intrahepatic congestion and hemorrhage increased in PAI-1-deficient mice 24 hours after APAP overdose. Administration of recombinant wild-type human PAI-1 reduced intrahepatic hemorrhage 24 hours after APAP challenge in PAI-1-/- mice, whereas a mutant PAI-1 lacking antiprotease function had no effect. Of interest, tPA deficiency alone did not affect APAP-induced liver damage. In contrast, fibrinolysis, intrahepatic congestion and hemorrhage, and mortality driven by PAI-1 deficiency were reduced in APAP-treated tPA-/-/PAI-1-/- double-knockout mice.

Highly induced during luteolysis, it acts as a natural anti-angiogenic, proapoptotic compound. THBS1 expression is regulated in bovine luteal endothelial cells (LECs) by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) acting in an opposite manner. Here we sought to identify specific microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting THBS1 and investigate their possible involvement in FGF2 and TGFB1-mediated THBS1 expression. Several miRNAs predicted to target THBS1 mRNA (miR-1, miR-18a, miR-144, miR-194, and miR-221) were experimentally tested. Of these, miR-221 was shown to efficiently target THBS1 expression and function in LECs. We found that this miRNA is highly expressed in luteal cells and in mid-cycle CL. Consistent with the inhibition of THBS1 function, miR-221 also reduced Serpin Family E Member 1 [SERPINE1] in LECs and promoted angiogenic characteristics of LECs. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the gene product of SERPINE1, inhibited cell adhesion, suggesting that PAI-1, like THBS1, has anti-angiogenic properties. Importantly, FGF2, which negatively regulates THBS1, elevates miR-221. Conversely, TGFB1 that stimulates THBS1, significantly reduces miR-221. Furthermore, FGF2 enhances the suppression of THBS1 caused by miR-221 mimic, and prevents the increase in THBS1 induced by miR-221 inhibitor. In contrast, TGFB1 reverses the inhibitory effect of miR-221 mimic on THBS1, and enhances the upregulation of THBS1 induced by miR-221 inhibitor. These data support the contention that FGF2 and TGFB1 modulate THBS1 via miR-221.

The novel immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) presents as the therapeutic 'Holly Grail' in lung cancer treatment.RECENT FINDINGS: Preclinical models provide evidence of immunotherapy-radiotherapy (IM-RT) synergy. The exposure to ionizing radiation turns tumor in an in-situ vaccine, primes the innate immune system, increases immunotherapy efficacy by overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of immune-resistant tumors and promotes a systemic, out-of-field antitumor T-cell-mediated response called abscopal effect. The immunomodulatory and abscopal effects of radiotherapy can be further enhanced by combining with systemic immunotherapies. The phase III START trial proved that liposomal vaccine - tecemotide (L-BLP25) administered as maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in LA-NSCLC prolongs survival. In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy.SUMMARY: PACIFIC trial results are expected to definitely establish durvalumab as standard consolidation strategy in LA-NSCLC.

The authors believe that durvalumab will likely play an important role in future treatment strategies for NSCLC. The PACIFIC trial assessing durvalumab after standard chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC has already met its primary endpoint and the potential of durvalumab will be reinforced if phase III randomized studies of first-line (MYSTIC trial) and second or subsequent (ARCTIC trial) lines of therapy demonstrate superiority over the current standard of care."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Combining the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody tremelimumab offers the potential for antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 tumor status.", "answer_start": 318}], "question": "What is the mechanism of action of durvalumab?", "id": "5c66329e7c78d6947100000f_015", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Anti-programmed cell death-1 and anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) monotherapies have shown promising clinical activity in advanced, refractory non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but antitumor activity appears to be greater in patients with PD-L1(+) tumors compared with patients harboring PD-L1(-) tumors.

Herein, we use cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) AML models to evaluate the combination of GO with daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) induction chemotherapy on AML blast growth and animal survival. DA chemotherapy and GO as separate treatments reduced AML burden but left significant chemoresidual disease in multiple AML models. The combination of GO and DA chemotherapy eliminated nearly all AML burden and extended overall survival. In two small subsets of AML models, chemoresidual disease following DA chemotherapy displayed hallmark markers of leukemic LICs (CLL1 and CD34). In vivo, the two chemoresistant subpopulations (CLL1+/CD117- and CD34+/CD38+) showed higher ability to self-renewal than their counterpart subpopulations, respectively. CD33 was coexpressed in these functional LIC subpopulations. We demonstrate that the GO and DA induction chemotherapy combination more effectively eliminates LICs in AML PDX models than either single agent alone.

We identified highly connected genes and compared these to genes currently annotated to alcohol-related behaviors and processes. The most highly connected gene not annotated to alcohol was Pafah1b1. Experimental validation using a Pafah1b1 conditional knock-out mouse confirmed that this gene is associated with an increased preference for alcohol and an altered thermoregulatory response to alcohol.

Combinatorial integration of functional genomics experimental results revealed a single QTL positional candidate gene in one of the loci common to both preference and withdrawal. Functional validation studies in Ap3m2 knockout mice confirmed these relationships. Genetic validation involves confirming the existence of segregating polymorphisms that could account for the phenotypic effect. By exploiting recent advances in mouse genotyping, sequence, epigenetics, and phylogeny resources, we confirmed that Ap3m2 resides in an appropriately segregating genomic region. We have demonstrated genetic and alcohol-induced regulation of Ap3m2 expression. Although sequence analysis revealed no polymorphisms in the Ap3m2-coding region that could account for all phenotypic differences, there are several upstream SNPs that could.

Hyperexcitability plays an important and debated role in the pathophysiology of motor neuron diseases, especially in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The mechanisms causing hyperexcitability are not yet clearly identified. While most studies favor a distal axonal origin site of fasciculations, some of the fasciculations could be of cortical origin. The consequences of hyperexcitability are also discussed, whether it is rather protective or deleterious in the disease course.

In order to standardize diagnosis for enrollment in clinical research, diagnostic criteria for ALS were created and revisited during the last 20 years.

With the exception of all uMD patients, none of the subjects had vertigo. Images of the inner ear fluid space, positive perilymph signal, and positive endolymph signal were acquired using a 3-T MRI scanner.

Recent outbreaks in Amish communities include a 2014 measles outbreak in Ohio, resulting in 368 cases reported. A recent outbreak of pertussis in an Amish community in Ohio resulted in the death of a 6-week-old Amish baby.METHODS: A study was designed to determine the knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and opinions of Amish parents relative to the immunization of Amish children. Data were collected through a questionnaire. Each potential participant was mailed a copy of a letter describing the proposed study. The questionnaire, a copy of the current immunization schedule, and a return stamped envelope were also included in the mailed packet. The study sample consisted of 84 Amish individuals who voluntarily filled out and returned questionnaires.RESULTS: The findings from the data analysis demonstrated that fear, especially concern over too many recommended immunizations and immunizations overwhelming the child's system, was the most frequent reported reasons for not having children immunized according to recommendations.CONCLUSIONS: Religious factors and access to care were not among reasons most reported.

The peptides predominant in an active ERAP1 context showed a higher frequency of nonamers and bulkier amino acid side chains at multiple positions, compared with the peptides predominant in a less active ERAP1 background.

Frequent all-grade, treatment-related adverse events included hyperglycemia (51.5%), nausea (50.0%), decreased appetite (41.8%), diarrhea (40.3%), and vomiting (31.3%). Alpelisib was rapidly absorbed; half-life was 7.6 hours at 400 mg once daily with minimal accumulation. Objective tumor responses were observed at doses ≥ 270 mg once daily; overall response rate was 6.0% (n = 8; one patient with endometrial cancer had a complete response, and seven patients with cervical, breast, endometrial, colon, and rectal cancers had partial responses). Stable disease was achieved in 70 (52.2%) patients and was maintained > 24 weeks in 13 (9.7%) patients; disease control rate (complete and partial responses and stable disease) was 58.2%. In patients with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, median progression-free survival was 5.5 months. Frequently mutated genes (≥ 10% tumors) included TP53 (51.3%), APC (23.7%), KRAS (22.4%), ARID1A (13.2%), and FBXW7 (10.5%). Conclusion Alpelisib demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and encouraging preliminary activity in patients with PIK3CA-altered solid tumors, supporting the rationale for selective PI3Kα inhibition in combination with other agents for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutant tumors."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Here, we have determined the effects of new anticancer drugs targeting specific PI3K isoforms on INaL and action potentials (APs) in mouse cardiomyocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO).

This study aimed to assess the safety and activity of alpelisib (a PI3Kα isoform-specific inhibitor) with T-DM1 in trastuzumab- and taxane-resistant HER2-positive MBC.METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive MBC that had progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy were treated with alpelisib daily and T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), adverse events, overall response rate (ORR), and clinical benefit rate (CBR = CR + PR + SD > 6 months) were assessed with descriptive statistics. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled with a median of 3 prior therapies for metastatic disease. The DLT was a maculopapular rash and MTD was 250 mg alpelisib daily. The most frequently occurring toxicities included fatigue, rash, gastrointestinal side effects, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and hyperglycemia. Fourteen patients were evaluable for response with an ORR of 43%. In patients with prior treatment and progression on T-DM1 (n = 10), the ORR was 30%. The CBR was 71% in evaluable patients and 60% in those with prior T-DM1.

All other physiologic parameters for both age groups were uniform and stable. In elderly animals, significant reduction of the CFI was first noted at IOP 40mmHg, as opposed to 60mmHg in adult animals. Individual assessment of CFI as a function of OPP for adult animals revealed a consistent plateau until OPP reached between 40 and 60mmHg. Elderly individuals demonstrated greater variability, with many showing a beginning of gradual deterioration of CFI at an OPP as high as 80mmHg. Overall comparison of CFI vs OPP between the two groups was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to adults, some, but not all, elderly animals demonstrate a more rapid deterioration of CFI vs OPP.

All other physiologic parameters for both age groups were uniform and stable. In elderly animals, significant reduction of the CFI was first noted at IOP 40mmHg, as opposed to 60mmHg in adult animals. Individual assessment of CFI as a function of OPP for adult animals revealed a consistent plateau until OPP reached between 40 and 60mmHg. Elderly individuals demonstrated greater variability, with many showing a beginning of gradual deterioration of CFI at an OPP as high as 80mmHg. Overall comparison of CFI vs OPP between the two groups was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to adults, some, but not all, elderly animals demonstrate a more rapid deterioration of CFI vs OPP. This suggests a reduced autoregulatory capacity that may contribute to increased glaucoma susceptibility in some older individuals. This variability must be considered when studying the relationship between IOP, ocular perfusion and glaucoma in elderly animal models.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Recent technological improvements have made the acquisition of 3D-OCT datasets feasible. However, while volumetric data can improve disease diagnosis and follow-up, novel image analysis techniques are now necessary in order to process the dense 3D-OCT dataset. Fundamental software improvements include methods for correcting subject eye motion, segmenting structures or volumes of interest, extracting relevant data post hoc and signal averaging to improve delineation of retinal layers. In addition, innovative methods for image display, such as C-mode sectioning, provide a unique viewing perspective and may improve interpretation of OCT images of pathologic structures. While all of these methods are being developed, most remain in an immature state. This review describes the current status of 3D-OCT scanning and interpretation, and discusses the need for standardization of clinical protocols as well as the potential benefits of 3D-OCT scanning that could come when software methods for fully exploiting these rich datasets are available clinically.

Cochlear uptake of FITC-DEX was evaluated via immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry at 6 hours, and 3 and 7 days after the final injection.RESULTS: FITC-DEX uptake was evident in spiral ganglion cells (SGs), the organ of Corti (OC), and the lateral walls (LWs), the basal turns of which were stained relatively prominently in both groups. Animals receiving IP injections exhibited higher FITC-DEX uptakes by the SGs and OC, whereas IT injection triggered higher-level FITC-DEX accumulation by the OC and LWs. Flow cytometry revealed that intracochlear FITC-DEX uptake by IT-injected animals was higher and more prolonged than in animals subjected to IP injections.CONCLUSION: We thus describe differences in cochlear steroid distributions after systemic and IT injections.

This study evaluated the preventive effects of RB supplementation on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and associated metabolic abnormalities induced by high fat diet (HFD). Wild-type male mice (six weeks old) were randomized into 4 groups receiving a control or typical western HFD supplemented with or without 5% freeze-dried RB for 12 weeks, when mice were sacrificed for tissue collection. HFD feeding substantially increased body weight, which was alleviated by RB supplementation towards the end of the feeding trial. Dietary RB restored the baseline blood glucose level, ameliorating glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, which were aggravated by HFD. Additionally, HFD reduced O2 expenditure and CO2 production, which were ameliorated by RB consumption. The liver is the key site for energy metabolism and a key peripheral tissue responsive to insulin. RB supplementation reduced hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD mice. In agreement, RB consumption suppressed hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 production in HFD mice, accompanied with normalized mitochondriogenesis. These results suggest that RB consumption improves insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in diet-induced obesity, which is concomitant with suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome elicited by HFD.

This similarity is irrespective of promoter CpG content. Methylation patterns of MSCs are distinct from those of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and multipotent hESC-derived mesenchymal cells (MCs). Moreover, in vitro MSC differentiation does not affect lineage-specific promoter methylation states, arguing that these methylation patterns in differentiated cells are already established at the progenitor stage. Further, we find a correlation between lineage-specific promoter hypermethylation and lack of differentiation capacity toward that lineage, but no relationship between weak promoter methylation and capacity of transcriptional activation or differentiation.

Meanwhile, the current application of generic treatment approaches to patients with vastly differing biological and clinical profiles is far from optimal. Here, we conduct a meta-review to identify predictors of response to antidepressant therapy in order to select robust input features for machine learning models of treatment response. These machine learning models will allow us to learn associations between patient features and treatment response which have predictive value at the individual patient level; this learning can be optimized by selecting high-quality input features for the model. While current research is difficult to directly apply to the clinic, machine learning models built using knowledge gleaned from current research may become useful clinical tools.METHODS: The EMBASE and MEDLINE/PubMed online databases were searched from January 1996 to August 2017, using a combination of MeSH terms and keywords to identify relevant literature reviews. We identified a total of 1909 articles, wherein 199 articles met our inclusion criteria.RESULTS: An array of genetic, immune, endocrine, neuroimaging, sociodemographic, and symptom-based predictors of treatment response were extracted, varying widely in clinical utility.LIMITATIONS: Due to heterogeneous sample sizes, effect sizes, publication biases, and methodological disparities across reviews, we could not accurately assess the strength and directionality of every predictor.CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding our cautious interpretation of the results, we have identified a multitude of predictors that can be used to formulate a priori hypotheses regarding the input features for a computational model. We highlight the importance of large-scale research initiatives and clinically accessible biomarkers, as well as the need for replication studies of current findings. In addition, we provide recommendations for future improvement and standardization of research efforts in this field.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

CAP-related depression was accompanied by increased levels of NOx, LOOH, AOPP, and TRAP. In CAP participants, there was a strong correlation (r = 0.734, p < 0.001) between root canal LPS and the HDRS score. There were significant and positive associations between CAP or root canal endotoxin with the vegetative and physio-somatic symptoms of the HDRS as well as a significant inverse association between root canal endotoxin and quality of life with strong effects on psychological, environmental, and social domains.

The KALYDECO patient exhibited an IVA plasma concentration of 0.97μg/mL at 2.5h post dosage. M1 and M6 plasma concentrations were 0.50μg/mL and 0.16μg/mL, respectively. Surprisingly, the ORKAMBI patient displayed very low plasma concentrations of IVA (0.06μg/mL) and M1 (0.07μg/mL). The M6 concentrations (0.15μg/mL) were comparable to those of the KALYDECO patient. However, we observed a relatively high plasma concentration of LUMA (4.42μg/mL). This reliable and novel method offers a simple and sensitive approach for therapeutic drug monitoring of KALYDECO and ORKAMBI in plasma and sputum.

In this study, we explored the pharmacological and metabolic effects of precision deuteration chemistry on ivacaftor by synthesizing two novel deuterated ivacaftor analogs, CTP-656 (d9-ivacaftor) and d18-ivacaftor. Ivacaftor is administered twice daily and is extensively converted in humans to major metabolites M1 and M6; therefore, the corresponding deuterated metabolites were also prepared. Both CTP-656 and d18-ivacaftor showed in vitro pharmacologic potency similar to that in ivacaftor, and the deuterated M1 and M6 metabolites showed pharmacology equivalent to that in the corresponding metabolites of ivacaftor, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies of deuterated compounds. However, CTP-656 exhibited markedly enhanced stability when tested in vitro. The deuterium isotope effects for CTP-656 metabolism (DV = 3.8, DV/K = 2.2) were notably large for a cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CTP-656 and d18-ivacaftor were assessed in six healthy volunteers in a single-dose crossover study, which provided the basis for advancing CTP-656 in development. The overall PK profile, including the 15.9-hour half-life for CTP-656, suggests that CTP-656 may be dosed once daily, thereby enhancing patient adherence.

Gaucher disease exhibits a number of subtypes, with types 2 and 3 showing significant neuropathology. Sandhoff disease results from the defective activity of β-hexosaminidase, leading to accumulation of ganglioside GM2. Niemann-Pick type C disease is primarily caused by the loss of activity of the lysosomal membrane protein, NPC1, leading to storage of cholesterol and sphingosine.

It is commonly assumed that neuroinflammation is the result of infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the brain; for instance, cells resembling lipid-engorged macrophages ('Gaucher cells') have been observed in the brain of Gaucher disease patients. We now review the evidence that inflammatory macrophages are recruited into the brain in these diseases and then go on to provide some experimental data that, at least in the three mouse models tested, monocyte-derived macrophages do not appear to infiltrate the brain. Resident microglia, which are phenotypically distinct from infiltrating macrophages, are the only myeloid population present in significant numbers within the brain parenchyma in these authentic mouse models, even during the late symptomatic stages of disease when there is substantial neuroinflammation.

SD leads to progressive neurodegeneration and early death. However, there is a lack of established SD biomarkers, while the pathogenesis etiology remains to be elucidated. To identify potential biomarkers and unveil the pathogenic mechanisms, metabolomics analysis with reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) was conducted. A total of 177, 112 and 119 metabolites were found to be significantly dysregulated in mouse liver, mouse brain and human hippocampus samples, respectively (p < .05, ID score > 0.5). Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis of the metabolites showed clear separation of metabolomics profiles between normal and diseased individuals. Among these metabolites, dipeptides, amino acids and derivatives were elevated, indicating a robust protein catabolism. Through pathway enrichment analysis, we also found alterations in metabolites associated with neurotransmission, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulphate, key component of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was significantly elevated, which was also confirmed by biochemical assays. Collectively, these results indicated major shifts of energy utilization and profound metabolic impairments, contributing to the pathogenesis mechanisms of SD. Global metabolomics profiling may provide an innovative tool for better understanding the disease mechanisms, and identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers for SD."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "With the rapid development in next-generation sequencing, cost and time requirements for genomic sequencing are decreasing, enabling applications in many areas such as cancer research.

In patients with HAM-TSP, HTLV-1 infects mainly CCR4+ T cells and induces functional changes, ultimately causing chronic spinal cord inflammation. We evaluated mogamulizumab, a humanized anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody that targets infected cells, in patients with HAM-TSP.METHODS: In this uncontrolled, phase 1-2a study, we assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of mogamulizumab in patients with glucocorticoid-refractory HAM-TSP. In the phase 1 dose-escalation study, 21 patients received a single infusion of mogamulizumab (at doses of 0.003 mg per kilogram of body weight, 0.01 mg per kilogram, 0.03 mg per kilogram, 0.1 mg per kilogram, or 0.3 mg per kilogram) and were observed for 85 days. Of those patients, 19 continued on to the phase 2a study and received infusions, over a period of 24 weeks, of 0.003 mg per kilogram, 0.01 mg per kilogram, or 0.03 mg per kilogram at 8-week intervals or infusions of 0.1 mg per kilogram or 0.3 mg per kilogram at 12-week intervals.RESULTS: The side effects of mogamulizumab did not limit administration up to the maximum dose (0.3 mg per kilogram). The most frequent side effects were grade 1 or 2 rash (in 48% of the patients) and lymphopenia and leukopenia (each in 33%). The dose-dependent reduction in the proviral load in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (decrease by day 15 of 64.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 51.7 to 78.1) and inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid (decrease by day 29 of 37.3% [95% CI, 24.8 to 49.8] in the CXCL10 level and of 21.0% [95% CI, 10.7 to 31.4] in the neopterin level) was maintained with additional infusions throughout the phase 2a study. A reduction in spasticity was noted in 79% of the patients and a decrease in motor disability in 32%.CONCLUSIONS: Mogamulizumab decreased the number of HTLV-1-infected cells and the levels of inflammatory markers. Rash was the chief side effect. The effect of mogamulizumab on clinical HAM-TSP needs to be clarified in future studies.

From the age of three months, brownish scaling was noted on the bathing suit area. Histology showed orthohyperkeratosis with acanthosis of the epidermis. The granular layer was normal, and the superficial dermis was mildly inflammatory, confirming a diagnosis of proliferating ichthyosis. Molecular analysis in the patient and her parents revealed the mutation I304F of TGM1.

Previous studies using molecular analysis have shown that BSI is caused mainly by mutations in TGM1. Twenty missense mutations have been reported in BSI. Of these 20 missense mutations, nine occurred only in patients with the BSI phenotype and 11 were common to BSI and other types of ARCI. Until recently, there has been no genotype-phenotype correlation. Therefore, the same mutation of the transglutaminase 1 could result in either generalized ARCI or BSI.

Eligible participants (aged ≥18 years) had biopsy-proven clinical stage T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer or refractory carcinoma in situ.

Patients were centrally assigned (1:1) via a web-based system, with block randomisation by institution, stratified by type of urinary diversion, clinical T stage, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, to receive robot-assisted radical cystectomy or open radical cystectomy with extracorporeal urinary diversion. Treatment allocation was only masked from pathologists. The primary endpoint was 2-year progression-free survival, with non-inferiority established if the lower bound of the one-sided 97·5% CI for the treatment difference (robotic cystectomy minus open cystectomy) was greater than -15 percentage points. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population. Safety was assessed in the same population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01157676.FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2011, and Nov 18, 2014, 350 participants were randomly assigned to treatment. The intended treatment was robotic cystectomy in 176 patients and open cystectomy in 174 patients. 17 (10%) of 176 patients in the robotic cystectomy group did not have surgery and nine (5%) patients had a different surgery to that they were assigned. 21 (12%) of 174 patients in the open cystectomy group did not have surgery and one (1%) patient had robotic cystectomy instead of open cystectomy. Thus, 302 patients (150 in the robotic cystectomy group and 152 in the open cystectomy group) were included in the per-protocol analysis set. 2-year progression-free survival was 72·3% (95% CI 64·3 to 78·8) in the robotic cystectomy group and 71·6% (95% CI 63·6 to 78·2) in the open cystectomy group (difference 0·7%, 95% CI -9·6% to 10·9%; pnon-inferiority=0·001), indicating non-inferiority of robotic cystectomy. Adverse events occurred in 101 (67%) of 150 patients in the robotic cystectomy group and 105 (69%) of 152 patients in the open cystectomy group. The most common adverse events were urinary tract infection (53 [35%] in the robotic cystectomy group vs 39 [26%] in the open cystectomy group) and postoperative ileus (33 [22%] in the robotic cystectomy group vs 31 [20%] in the open cystectomy group).INTERPRETATION: In patients with bladder cancer, robotic cystectomy was non-inferior to open cystectomy for 2-year progression-free survival. Increased adoption of robotic surgery in clinical practice should lead to future randomised trials to assess the true value of this surgical approach in patients with other cancer types.FUNDING: National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is becoming the preferred surgical approach in many centres as it seems to maintain the oncological control of open surgery whilst offering improved perioperative benefits.Materials and methods: A review of the literature was conducted using the Pubmed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge and Cochrane Databases to identify studies that included both ORC and RARC with intracorporeal and extracorporeal urinary diversion (UD) published up to July 2017.Results: Evidence from four single-centre randomised controlled trials and now the multicentre Randomized Trial of Open versus Robotic Cystectomy (RAZOR) trial demonstrate the oncological equivalence of RARC to ORC. The only convincing evidence for the superiority of RARC is in the area of blood loss and transfusion rates. However, the UD procedure in these trials was performed extracorporeally and, to realise the full benefits of RARC, a totally intracorporeal approach is needed. Intracorporeal UDs (ICUDs) have been shown to be technically feasible by a few expert centres and have demonstrated some improved short-term perioperative outcomes compared to extracorporeal UDs.Conclusions: Although initial outcomes appear promising, RARC with ICUD is far from gaining 'gold standard' status.

This work characterized upadacitinib population pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and RA patients and the effects of covariates on upadacitinib exposure.METHODS: Upadacitinib plasma concentrations (n = 6399) from 107 healthy subjects and 466 RA patients from three phase I and two 12-week RA phase IIb trials (1-48 mg immediate-release doses across studies) were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. The models were qualified using bootstrap and stochastic simulations.RESULTS: A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination described upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. Estimates (95% bootstrap confidence interval) for upadacitinib oral clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, absorption lag time, and mean absorption time were 39.7 (37.8-41.5) L/h, 210 (196-231) L, 0.48 (0.47-0.49) h, and 0.08 (0.04-0.12) h, respectively, for a typical healthy male. Matching on other covariates, a 16 and 32% higher upadacitinib area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was estimated for females relative to males, and for subjects with RA relative to healthy volunteers, respectively. Subjects with RA with mild or moderate renal impairment were estimated to have 16 and 32% higher upadacitinib AUC, respectively, compared with subjects with RA with normal renal function. Upadacitinib clearance was not correlated with body weight.CONCLUSIONS: Upadacitinib pharmacokinetics follow dose-proportional, bi-exponential disposition.

Recent reports of transmission of lamivudine-resistant HBV in HIV patients are of especial concern, and large surveillance studies suggest that it may occur in up to 10% of new HBV infections in Western countries. Another worrisome aspect of the selection of lamivudine-resistant HBV is the potential for selection of vaccine escape mutants.

Its co-formulation with emtricitabine (Truvada) is particularly convenient for treating both HIV and HBV in co-infected individuals.

In HBeAg-negative HIV patients, adefovir may be an option but the relatively low antiviral potency of this drug discourages its wide use.

One of the 'five pillars' to achieve this goal is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is currently the only medication approved for PrEP. Despite its advantages, Truvada is costly and requires individuals to adhere to the once-daily regimen. To improve PrEP, many next-generation regimen, including long-acting formulations, are currently investigated. However, pre-clinical testing may not guide candidate selection, since it often fails to translate into clinical efficacy. On the other hand, quantifying prophylactic efficacy in the clinic is ethically problematic and requires to conduct long (years) and large (N>1000 individuals) trials, precluding systematic evaluation of candidates and deployment strategies. To prioritize- and help design PrEP regimen, tools are urgently needed that integrate pharmacological-, viral- and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy. Integrating the aforementioned factors, we developed an efficient and exact stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy, as an example for dolutegravir (DTG). Combining the population pharmacokinetics of DTG with the stochastic framework, we predicted that plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50- and 90% sexual transmissions respectively. We then predicted the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in PrEP, PrEP 'on demand' and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before/after virus exposure. Once daily PrEP with 50mg oral DTG prevented 99-100% infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP 'on demand' prevented 79-84% infections and PEP >80% when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. While the simulation framework can easily be adapted to other PrEP candidates, our simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada. Moreover, the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP; emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Truvada]) prevents HIV without penalizing sexual pleasure, and may even enhance pleasure (e.g., by reducing HIV-related anxiety).", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the indication for Truvada?", "id": "5c5f29a81a4c55d80b00001f_010", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP; emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Truvada]) prevents HIV without penalizing sexual pleasure, and may even enhance pleasure (e.g., by reducing HIV-related anxiety).

Activation of innate immune responses and excessive production of type I interferons (IFNs) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Recognition of nucleic acids by cytosolic nucleic acid sensors is a major trigger for the induction of type I IFNs. Upon activation, cytosolic DNA sensors can interact with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, and activation of STING causes increased expression of type I IFNs. The role of STING activation in SS is not known. In this study, to investigate whether the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway influences SS development, female C57BL/6 mice were injected with a STING agonist, dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA). Salivary glands (SGs) were studied for gene expression and inflammatory cell infiltration. SG function was evaluated by measuring pilocarpine-induced salivation. Sera were analyzed for cytokines and autoantibodies. Primary SG cells were used to study the expression and activation of STING. Our data show that systemic DMXAA treatment rapidly induced the expression of Ifnb1, Il6, and Tnfa in the SGs, and these cytokines were also elevated in circulation. In contrast, increased Ifng gene expression was dominantly detected in the SGs. The type I innate lymphoid cells present within the SGs were the major source of IFN-γ, and their numbers increased significantly within 3 d of treatment. STING expression in SGs was mainly observed in ductal and interstitial cells. In primary SG cells, DMXAA activated STING and induced IFN-β production. The DMXAA-treated mice developed autoantibodies, sialoadenitis, and glandular hypofunction. Our study demonstrates that activation of the STING pathway holds the potential to initiate SS.

There are several types of genetic and acquired FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. Among these diseases, X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), which is caused by inactivating mutations in the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX) gene, is the most prevalent form of genetic FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets. Another clinically relevant form of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic disease is tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with FGF23-producing tumors. A combination of active vitamin D and phosphate salts is the current medical therapy used to treat patients with XLH and inoperative TIO. However, this therapy has certain efficacy- and safety-associated limitations. Several measures to inhibit FGF23 activity have been considered as possible new treatments for FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. In particular, a humanized monoclonal antibody for FGF23 (burosumab) is a promising treatment in patients with XLH and TIO.

We investigated burosumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets FGF-23, in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia.METHODS: In an open-label, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 52 children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous burosumab either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks; the dose was adjusted to achieve a serum phosphorus level at the low end of the normal range. The primary end point was the change from baseline to weeks 40 and 64 in the Thacher rickets severity total score (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity). In addition, the Radiographic Global Impression of Change was used to evaluate rachitic changes from baseline to week 40 and to week 64. Additional end points were changes in pharmacodynamic markers, linear growth, physical ability, and patient-reported outcomes and the incidence of adverse events.RESULTS: The mean Thacher rickets severity total score decreased from 1.9 at baseline to 0.8 at week 40 with every-2-week dosing and from 1.7 at baseline to 1.1 at week 40 with every-4-week dosing (P<0.001 for both comparisons); these improvements persisted at week 64. The mean serum phosphorus level increased after the first dose in both groups, and more than half the patients in both groups had levels within the normal range (3.2 to 6.1 mg per deciliter [1.0 to 2.0 mmol per liter]) by week 6. Stable serum phosphorus levels were maintained through week 64 with every-2-week dosing. Renal tubular phosphate reabsorption increased from baseline in both groups, with an overall mean increase of 0.98 mg per deciliter (0.32 mmol per liter). The mean dose of burosumab at week 40 was 0.98 mg per kilogram of body weight with every-2-week dosing and 1.50 mg per kilogram with every-4-week dosing. Across both groups, the mean serum alkaline phosphatase level decreased from 459 U per liter at baseline to 369 U per liter at week 64. The mean standing-height z score increased in both groups, with greater improvement seen at all time points with every-2-week dosing (an increase from baseline of 0.19 at week 64) than with every-4-week dosing (an increase from baseline of 0.12 at week 64). Physical ability improved and pain decreased. Nearly all the adverse events were mild or moderate in severity.CONCLUSIONS: In children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, treatment with burosumab improved renal tubular phosphate reabsorption, serum phosphorus levels, linear growth, and physical function and reduced pain and the severity of rickets.

Reductions in WOMAC physical function subscale (-4.9 ± 2.48; p = 0.048) and Brief Pain Inventory worst pain (-0.5 ± 0.28; p = 0.092) did not achieve statistical significance after Hochberg multiplicity adjustment. At week 24, 43.1% (burosumab) and 7.7% (placebo) of baseline active fractures were fully healed; the odds of healed fracture in the burosumab group was 16.8-fold greater than that in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption increased significantly from baseline with burosumab treatment compared with placebo. The safety profile of burosumab was similar to placebo. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events or meaningful changes from baseline in serum or urine calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, or nephrocalcinosis. These data support the conclusion that burosumab is a novel therapeutic addressing an important medical need in adults with XLH.© 2018 The Authors.

During HCMV replication, DNA maturation and packaging are performed by the terminase complex, which cleaves DNA to package the genome into the capsid. Identified in herpesviruses and bacteriophages, and with no counterpart in mammalian cells, these terminase proteins are ideal targets for highly specific antivirals.

We identified 11 achalasia (9.6%) and 5 GERD patients (4.16%) with an inflammatory condition. Compared with the GERD, the achalasia group was 3.8 times more likely to have an autoimmune disease (95% CI: 1.47-9.83), 3.0 times more likely to have thyroidopathies (95% CI: 1.00-9.03), and 3.02 times more likely to suffer from any chronic inflammatory disease (95% CI: 1.65-6.20).CONCLUSIONS: The non-negligible number of patients with autoimmune diseases identified among the patients with idiopathic achalasia supports the hypothesis that achalasia has an autoimmune component.© 2017 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The pathophysiology of achalasia is largely unknown, and involves the destruction of ganglion cell in the esophageal myenteric plexus.

Although lacking clinical signs of neuropathy, more accurate diagnostic methods have shown neuropathic involvement at various levels of the neuraxis in BMS: peripheral small fiber damage (thermal quantitative sensory testing, electrogustatometry, epithelial nerve fiber density), trigeminal system lesions in the periphery or the brainstem (brainstem reflex recordings, trigeminal neurography, evoked potentials), or signs of decreased inhibition within the central nervous system (deficient brainstem reflex habituation, positive signs in quantitative sensory testing, neurotransmitter-positron emission tomography findings indicative of deficient striatal dopamine function). Abnormalities in electrogustatometry indicate the involvement of the small Aδ taste afferents, in addition to somatosensory small fibers. According to these findings, the clinical entity of BMS can be divided into 2 main subtypes compatible with either peripheral or central neuropathic pain, which may overlap in individual patients. The central type does not respond to local treatments and associates often with psychiatric comorbidity (depression or anxiety), whereas the peripheral type responds to peripheral lidocaine blocks and topical clonazepam.

It occurs more commonly in middle-aged and elderly women and often affects the tongue tip and lateral borders, lips, and hard and soft palate. In addition to a burning sensation, the patients with BMS may also complain unremitting oral mucosal pain, dysgeusia, and xerostomia. BMS can be classified into two clinical forms: primary and secondary BMS. The primary BMS is essential or idiopathic, in which the organic local/systemic causes cannot be identified and a neuropathological cause is likely. The diagnosis of primary BMS depends mainly on exclusion of etiological factors. The secondary BMS is caused by local, systemic, and/or psychological factors; thus, its diagnosis depends on identification of the exact causative factor. When local, systemic or psychological factors are present, treatment or elimination of these factors usually results in a significant clinical improvement of BMS symptoms. Vitamin, zinc, or hormone replacement therapy has been found to be effective for reducing the oral burning or pain symptom in some BMS patients with deficiency of the corresponding factor. If patients still have the symptoms after the removal of potential causes, drug therapy should be instituted. Previous randomized controlled clinical trials found that drug therapy with capsaicin, alpha-lipoic acid, clonazepam, and antidepressants may provide relief of oral burning or pain symptom. In addition, psychotherapy and behavioral feedback may also help eliminate the BMS symptoms."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "AFP serum were considered independent predictors for macrovascular invasion in HCC patients", "answer_start": 1432}], "question": "When is serum AFP used as marker?", "id": "5c7839edd774d04240000003_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Extremely poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with progressing disease was denoted by vascular invasion.

Transfection efficiency was assessed with immunofluorescence, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. The downstream genes alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Jagged1 and the differentiation markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin (ALB), cytokeratin19 (CK19), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), and hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) were measured with qRT-PCR and western blotting.KEY FINDINGS: SpHBLV-CMVIE-TGF-β1, pHBLV-CMVIE-GFP, pHBLV-U6-TGF-β-R1 shRNA, and pHBLV-U6-RFP were successfully transfected. Over-expression of the TGF-β1 gene caused mHSCs to transform into myofibroblasts (MFs) and expression of Jagged1 and cholangiocyte markers (CK19, SOX9, Hes1) were significantly upregulated (P<0.01). Importantly, after blocking TGF-β1 signaling via gene silencing, expression of Jagged1 was much reduced, but the mature hepatocyte marker (ALB) was obviously increased. In addition, AFP, a hepatic stem cell marker, was expressed at the highest level in the control groups.SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings emphasize that the TGF-β1 signaling pathway regulates expression of Jagged1 in mHSCs which is associated with transformation of mHSCs into MFs, thus demonstrating a novel mechanism via which TGF-β1 signaling controls the differentiation fate of mHSCs through regulation of the Jagged1/Notch pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The complete genome of the Indonesian equine-like G3P[8] strain demonstrated highest genetic identity to G3P[8] strains circulating in Hungary and Spain.CONCLUSIONS: The dominant circulating strain during the Indonesian Phase IIb efficacy trial of the RV3-BB vaccine was an equine-like G3P[8] strain. The equine-like G3P[8] strain is an emerging cause of severe gastroenteritis in Indonesia and in other regions.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

This review discusses some of the controversies and opportunities for improved disease control in severe asthma.RECENT FINDINGS: Currently approved anti-immunoglobulin E and anti-interleukin 5 biologics, which target specific pathways instead of using a 'one size fits all' strategy, are efficacious and well tolerated therapies for severe asthma. The appropriate use of these biologics, and of those in development (e.g., benralizumab and dupilumab), should be aided by further understanding of asthma phenotypes and endotypes, utilizing appropriate biomarkers.Oral corticosteroids are often added as maintenance therapy for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, but their use is associated with significant adverse effects and should be considered a last option. The true cost of this therapy, including the cost of morbidities associated with its use, remains to be determined.Severe asthma in pediatrics poses a unique opportunity for possible prevention strategies and the potential for primary prevention. Although several avenues for primary prevention are being explored and are out of the scope of this review, we focus our discussion on the use of omalizumab, which has been recently explored in clinical trials.SUMMARY: Appropriate use of biologics in severe asthma should be supported by further understanding of biomarkers predicting response to targeted therapy. Because of their association with significant adverse effects, add-on oral corticosteroids should be considered a last treatment option for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma.

In patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma, targeting IL-13 alone with biologics including lebrikizumab and tralokinumab has not shown consistent reduction in asthma exacerbations. Simultaneous targeting of both IL-4 and IL-13 by blocking IL-4 receptor α using dupilumab has yielded more consistent results in reducing asthma exacerbations and improving lung function, especially in patients with increased blood eosinophils. Other biomarkers of T2 inflammation such as exhaled nitric oxide and serum periostin may also predict response to biologics targeting the IL-4/IL-13 pathway.SUMMARY: No biologic targeting the IL-4/IL-13 pathway is currently available for treatment of asthma, but emerging data suggest that biologics targeting IL-4 and IL-13 together may benefit patients with T2 high asthma.

Regardless of effective treatments being widely available and the existence of treatment guidelines, a large population of severe asthma cases remain uncontrolled. Achieving and maintaining asthma control in this group of patients is, therefore, of utmost importance. The recognition of distinct inflammatory phenotypes within this population has driven the development of targeted biological therapies - particularly, selective targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

UPDs are rare events of chromosomal malsegregation and describe the condition of two homologous chromosomes or homologous chromosomal segments that were inherited from one parent. The occurrence of UPD can be of major clinical relevance. Though high-throughput molecular screening techniques are widely used, detection of UPDs and especially the subclassification remains complex. We developed UPDtool to detect and classify UPDs from SNP microarray data of parent-child trios. The algorithm was tested using five positive controls including both iso- and heterodisomic segmental UPDs and 30 trios from the HapMap project as negative controls. With UPDtool, we were able to correctly identify all occurrences of non-mosaic UPD within our positive controls, whereas no occurrence of UPD was found within our negative controls. In addition, the chromosomal breakage points could be determined more precisely than by microsatellite analysis. Our results were compared with both the gold standard, microsatellite analysis and SNPtrio, another program available for UPD detection. UPDtool is platform independent, light weight and flexible. Because of its simple input format, UPDtool may also be used with other high-throughput technologies (e.g., next-generation sequencing).AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: UPDtool executables, documentation and examples can be downloaded from http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/thk/de/f-genomik-software.html."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Second-generation NSAA receptor antagonists (enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide) are emerging as additional new options to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer.", "answer_start": 440}], "question": "Describe the mechanism of action of apalutamide.", "id": "5c6dfba77c78d69471000046_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in men.

Most prostate cancer patients who are initially responsive develop the most aggressive form of disease called castration-resistant prostate cancer. Second-generation NSAA receptor antagonists (enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide) are emerging as additional new options to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. The objective of this work was to review the literature on the bioanalytical methods for the quantification of first- and second-generation NSAA inhibitors in clinical (human plasma) and preclinical (mouse plasma, rat plasma, urine and tissue homogenates etc.) studies along with relevant case studies for some chosen drugs.

We evaluated the efficacy of apalutamide in men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were at high risk for the development of metastasis.METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial involving men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of 10 months or less. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive apalutamide (240 mg per day) or placebo. All the patients continued to receive androgen-deprivation therapy. The primary end point was metastasis-free survival, which was defined as the time from randomization to the first detection of distant metastasis on imaging or death.RESULTS: A total of 1207 men underwent randomization (806 to the apalutamide group and 401 to the placebo group). In the planned primary analysis, which was performed after 378 events had occurred, median metastasis-free survival was 40.5 months in the apalutamide group as compared with 16.2 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for metastasis or death, 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.35; P<0.001).

The 22Rv1, PC3, and DU145 cell lines were used to study the effect of ARN and bicalutamide on the expression cytoplasmic/nuclear kinetics of AR, AR-V7 variant, phosphorylated AR, as well as the levels of the AR downstream proteins prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2, under exposure to testosterone and/or hypoxia. The effects on autophagic flux (LC3A, p62, TFEB, LAMP2a, cathepsin D) and cell metabolism-related enzymes (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α/2α, BNIP3, carbonic anhydrase 9, LDHA, PDH, PDH-kinase) were also studied. The 22Rv1 cell line responded to testosterone by increasing the nuclear entry of AR, AR-V7, and phosphorylated AR and by increasing the levels of prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2. This effect was strongly abrogated by ARN and to a clearly lower extent by bicalutamide at 10 μmol/l, both in normoxia and in hypoxia. ARN had a stronger antiproliferative effect than bicalutamide, which was prominent in the 22Rv1 hormone-responsive cell line, and completely repressed cell proliferation at a concentration of 100 μmol/l. No effect of testosterone or of antiandrogens on autophagy flux, hypoxia-related proteins, or metabolism enzyme levels was noted. The PC3 and DU145 cell lines showed poor expression of the proteins and were not responsive to testosterone.

Novel androgen receptor pathway inhibitors are nowadays available for treatment of metastatic PCa and these compounds are promising for early stage disease. Apalutamide is a pure androgen antagonist with a very high affinity with the androgen receptor. The combination of apalutamide with degarelix, an LHRH antagonist, could increase the efficacy compared to degarelix alone.OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to assess the difference in proportions of minimal residual disease at prostatectomy specimen between apalutamide + degarelix vs placebo + degarelix. Various secondary endpoints are assessed: variations of different biomarkers at the tumour level (tissue microarrays to evaluate DNA-PKs, PARP, AR and splice variants, PSMA, etc.), whole transcriptome sequencing, exome sequencing and clinical (PSA and testosterone kinetics, early biochemical recurrence free survival, quality of life, safety, etc.) and radiological endpoints.METHODS: ARNEO is a single centre, phase II, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. The plan is to include at least 42 patients per each of the two study arms. Patients with intermediate/high-risk PCa and who are amenable for radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection can be included. After signing an informed consent, every patient will undergo a pelvic 68Ga -PSMA-11 PSMA PET/MR and receive degarelix at standard dosage and start assuming apalutamide/placebo (60 mg 4 tablets/day) for 12 weeks. Within thirty days from the last study medication intake the same imaging will be repeated. Every patient will undergo PSA and testosterone testing the day of randomization, before the first drug intake, and after the last dose. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumour samples will be collected and used for transcriptome analysis, exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry.DISCUSSION: ARNEO will allow us to answer, first, whether the combined treatment can result in an increased proportion of patients with minimal residual disease. Secondly, It will enable the study of the molecular consequences at the level of the tumour. Thirdly, what the consequences are of new generation androgen receptor pathway inhibitors on 68Ga -PSMA-11 PET/MR.

Patients were enrolled to three dose cohorts according to a rolling six design. Larotrectinib was administered orally (capsule or liquid formulation), twice daily, on a continuous 28-day schedule, in increasing doses adjusted for age and bodyweight. The primary endpoint of the phase 1 dose escalation component was the safety of larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity. All patients who received at least one dose of larotrectinib were included in the safety analyses. Reported here are results of the phase 1 dose escalation cohort. Phase 1 follow-up and phase 2 are ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02637687.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2015, and April 13, 2017, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) with a median age of 4·5 years (IQR 1·3-13·3) were enrolled to three dose cohorts: cohorts 1 and 2 were assigned doses on the basis of both age and bodyweight predicted by use of SimCyp modelling to achieve an area under the curve equivalent to the adult doses of 100 mg twice daily (cohort 1) and 150 mg twice daily (cohort 2); and cohort 3 was assigned to receive a dose of 100 mg/m2 twice daily (maximum 100 mg per dose), regardless of age, equating to a maximum of 173% of the recommended adult phase 2 dose. Among enrolled patients harbouring TRK fusion-positive cancers, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2 (occurring in 21 [88%] of 24 patients); the most common larotrectinib-related adverse events of all grades were increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ten [42%] of 24 each), leucopenia (five [21%] of 24), decreased neutrophil count (five [21%] of 24), and vomiting (five [21%] of 24). Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation was the only dose-limiting toxicity and occurred in one patient without a TRK fusion and with progressive disease. No grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed. Two larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were observed: grade 3 nausea and grade 3 ejection fraction decrease during the 28-day follow-up after discontinuing larotrectinib and while on anthracyclines. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 100 mg/m2 (maximum of 100 mg per dose) was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response.

Larotrectinib, a highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of the TRK kinases, had shown activity in preclinical models and in adults with tumours harbouring TRK fusions. This study aimed to assess the safety of larotrectinib in paediatric patients.METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study was done at eight sites in the USA and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion status; had a Karnofsky (≥16 years of age) or Lansky (<16 years of age) performance status score of 50 or more, adequate organ function, and full recovery from the acute toxic effects of all previous anticancer therapy. Following a protocol amendment on Sept 12, 2016, patients with locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma who would require disfiguring surgery to achieve a complete surgical resection were also eligible. Patients were enrolled to three dose cohorts according to a rolling six design. Larotrectinib was administered orally (capsule or liquid formulation), twice daily, on a continuous 28-day schedule, in increasing doses adjusted for age and bodyweight. The primary endpoint of the phase 1 dose escalation component was the safety of larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity. All patients who received at least one dose of larotrectinib were included in the safety analyses. Reported here are results of the phase 1 dose escalation cohort. Phase 1 follow-up and phase 2 are ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02637687.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2015, and April 13, 2017, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) with a median age of 4·5 years (IQR 1·3-13·3) were enrolled to three dose cohorts: cohorts 1 and 2 were assigned doses on the basis of both age and bodyweight predicted by use of SimCyp modelling to achieve an area under the curve equivalent to the adult doses of 100 mg twice daily (cohort 1) and 150 mg twice daily (cohort 2); and cohort 3 was assigned to receive a dose of 100 mg/m2 twice daily (maximum 100 mg per dose), regardless of age, equating to a maximum of 173% of the recommended adult phase 2 dose. Among enrolled patients harbouring TRK fusion-positive cancers, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2 (occurring in 21 [88%] of 24 patients); the most common larotrectinib-related adverse events of all grades were increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ten [42%] of 24 each), leucopenia (five [21%] of 24), decreased neutrophil count (five [21%] of 24), and vomiting (five [21%] of 24). Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation was the only dose-limiting toxicity and occurred in one patient without a TRK fusion and with progressive disease. No grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed. Two larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were observed: grade 3 nausea and grade 3 ejection fraction decrease during the 28-day follow-up after discontinuing larotrectinib and while on anthracyclines. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 100 mg/m2 (maximum of 100 mg per dose) was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response.

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), Merck's anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), received accelerated approval in May 2017 by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as having microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR). Shortly after, nivolumab (Opdivo), Bristol-Myers Squibb's anti-PD-1 mAb, gained an accelerated approval in August 2017 for adult and pediatric patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. These regulatory approvals marked an important milestone that a cancer treatment may be approved based on a common biomarker rather than the anatomic location in the body where the tumor originated, and therefore established a precedent for tumor type-agnostic therapy. In the 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meeting, larotrectinib (LOXO-101), Loxooncology's oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), demonstrated unprecedented efficacy on unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK)-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients. Both the anti-PD-1 mAbs and the TRK-targeting therapies share some basic features: (a) biomarker-based, well-defined rare patient population; (b) exceptionally high clinical efficacy, e.g., near 40% overall response rate (ORR) for pembrolizumab across 15 tumor types with MSI-H/dMMR and 75% ORR for larotrectinib across more than 12 tumor types with NTRK-fusion proteins; (c) durable responses lasting at least 6 months with complete responses observed; and (d) parallel development in adult and pediatric populations. With increasing accessibility to genetic analysis tools such as next-generation sequencing, tumor type-agnostic therapy has become a reality, both during clinical development and in clinical practice.

LOXO-195 is a selective TRK TKI designed to overcome acquired resistance mediated by recurrent kinase domain (solvent front and xDFG) mutations identified in multiple patients who have developed resistance to TRK TKIs. Activity against these acquired mutations was confirmed in enzyme and cell-based assays and in vivo tumor models. As clinical proof of concept, the first 2 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers who developed acquired resistance mutations on larotrectinib were treated with LOXO-195 on a first-in-human basis, utilizing rapid dose titration guided by pharmacokinetic assessments.

Here we provide the first insight into the molecular variation and evolutionary history of the endemic Australian scorpion Urodacus yaschenkoi. Also known as the inland robust scorpion, it is widely distributed throughout arid zones of the continent and is emerging as a model organism in biomedical research due to the chemical nature of its venom.METHODS: We employed Bayesian Inference (BI) methods for the phylogenetic reconstructions and divergence dating among lineages, using unique haplotype sequences from two mitochondrial loci (COXI, 16S) and one nuclear locus (28S). We also implemented two DNA taxonomy approaches (GMYC and PTP/dPTP) to evaluate the presence of cryptic species. Linear Discriminant Analysis was used to test whether the linear combination of 21 variables (ratios of morphological measurements) can predict individual's membership to a putative species.RESULTS: Genetic and morphological data suggest that U. yaschenkoi is a species complex. High statistical support for the monophyly of several divergent lineages was found both at the mitochondrial loci and at a nuclear locus. The extent of mitochondrial divergence between these lineages exceeds estimates of interspecific divergence reported for other scorpion groups. The GMYC model and the PTP/bPTP approach identified major lineages and several sub-lineages as putative species. Ratios of several traits that approximate body shape had a strong predictive power (83-100%) in discriminating two major molecular lineages. A time-calibrated phylogeny dates the early divergence at the onset of continental-wide aridification in late Miocene and Pliocene, with finer-scale phylogeographic patterns emerging during the Pleistocene. This structuring dynamics is congruent with the diversification history of other fauna of the Australian arid zones.DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that the taxonomic status of U. yaschenkoi requires revision, and we provide recommendations for such future efforts. A complex evolutionary history and extensive diversity highlights the importance of conserving U. yaschenkoi populations from different Australian arid zones in order to preserve patterns of endemism and evolutionary potential."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Phylogenetic analyses of mitogenome sequences by maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference identified a monophyletic RSA clade, subdivided into two clades.", "answer_start": 682}], "question": "What is Bayesian haplotyping used for?", "id": "5c6bedd57c78d69471000034_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz and A.m. scutellata Lepeletier are subspecies of western honey bees that are indigenous to the Republic of South Africa (RSA).

Skin findings include papules and plaques, follicular spicules, purpura, haemorrhagic bullae, macroglossia and nail changes. The skin findings in cryoglobulinemia (CG) result from vascular immunoglobulin deposition, either as immune complexes within the vessel walls in mixed CG or within the lumina of small vessels in monoclonal CG. Mixed CG manifests as palpable purpura of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and monoclonal CG as stellar and/or retiform purpura that can evolve into extensive skin necrosis. In some rare instances, immunoglobulins have a specific biological activity. This is, for example, the case when they bind lipoproteins that precipitate and induce hypocomplementemic xanthomas. Xanthoderma related to antiflavin activity of the monoclonal component or acquired angioedema related to anti-C1INH activity is other example. Abnormal cytokine secretion is the hallmark of some entities. High vascular endothelial growth factor levels correlate with some of the skin manifestations of the Polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal component skin changes syndrome, such as hypertrichosis or the adenopathy and extensive skin patch overlying plasmacytoma syndrome.

As herpetic whitlow is not seen often, it may go under-recognised or be mistaken for a different kind of infection of the finger. Delayed recognition and/or treatment puts patients at risk of complications ranging from superinfection to herpetic encephalitis.CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old Caucasian man with no medical history was referred by his primary care physician because of erythema and swelling of the little finger of his left hand. The primary care physician had already treated him with the oral antibiotic Augmentin® (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) and incision of the finger, but this had not resolved his complaints. He had multiple vesicles on the finger, which led to the diagnosis of herpetic whitlow, which we confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing. All cutaneous abnormalities disappeared after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Whitlow is rarely caused by the herpes simplex virus, but this disease requires a swift recognition and treatment to prevent complications. This case serves to emphasise that not all whitlow is caused by a bacterial infection, and that it is important to differentiate between herpetic and bacterial whitlow, as these diseases require a different treatment."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Herpetic whitlow is an acute viral infection of the hand caused by either herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 or 2.

A recurrence with positive Kanavel's signs suggested flexor tenosynovitis at seven months. Her symptoms improved transiently following emergent surgical open flexor sheath exploration and washout however, she required two further washouts; at eleven and thirteen months to improve symptoms. Viral cultures were obtained from the third washout as HSV infection was disclosed from further history taking. These were positive for HSV2. Treatment with acyclovir at thirteen months after presentation led to a complete resolution of her symptoms with no further recurrences to date. This rare case highlights the similarity in presentation between flexor sheath infection and herpetic whitlow which can lead to diagnostic confusion and mismanagement.

Because CF was first described in 1938, there has been a substantial growth of genetic and phenotypic information about the disorder.

Recent consensus guidelines have provided recommendations for clinicians and laboratorians to better assist with interpretation of disease status and related CF mutations. The highly recommended Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR project should be the first resource in the evaluation of disease severity for CF mutations. Screen-positive newborns and patients with high clinical suspicion for CF are always recommended to undergo confirmatory sweat chloride testing with interpretations based on updated reference intervals. Every patient diagnosed with CF should receive genotyping, as novel molecular therapies are becoming standard of practice.

We have developed a wearable sensor with an integrated salt bridge for real-time measurement of sweat chloride concentration. Here, in a proof-of-concept study, we compare the performance of the sensor to current clinical practice in CF patients and healthy subjects.METHOD: Sweat was induced on both forearms of 10 individuals with CF and 10 healthy subjects using pilocarpine iontophoresis. A Macroduct sweat collection device was attached to one arm and sweat was collected for 30 min and then sent for laboratory analysis. A sensor was attached to the other arm and the chloride ion concentration monitored in real time for 30 min using a Bluetooth transceiver and smart phone app.RESULTS: Stable sweat chloride measurements were obtained within 15 min following sweat induction using the wearable sensor. We define the detection time as the time at which the standard deviation of the real-time chloride ion concentration remained below 2 mEq/L for 5 min. The sweat volume for sensor measurements at the detection time was 13.1 ± 11.4 μL (SD), in many cases lower than the minimum sweat volume of 15 μL for conventional testing. The mean difference between sweat chloride concentrations measured by the sensor and the conventional laboratory practice was 6.2 ± 9.5 mEq/L (SD), close to the arm-to-arm variation of about 3 mEq/L. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two measurements was 0.97 highlighting the excellent agreement between the two methods.CONCLUSION: A wearable sensor can be used to make real-time measurements of sweat chloride within 15 min following sweat induction, requiring a small sweat volume, and with excellent agreement to standard methods.Copyright © 2018 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

This is because newborn screening started relatively recently, it is not performed everywhere, and even for individuals who were screened, there is the possibility of a false negative. To limit irreversible organ pathology, a timely diagnosis of CF and institution of CF therapies can greatly benefit these patients.STUDY DESIGN: Experts on CF diagnosis were convened at the 2015 CF Foundation Diagnosis Consensus Conference. The participants reviewed and discussed published works and instructive cases of CF diagnosis in individuals presenting with signs, symptoms, or a family history of CF. Through a modified Delphi methodology, several consensus statements were agreed upon. These consensus statements were updates of prior CF diagnosis conferences and recommendations.RESULTS: CF diagnosis in individuals outside of newborn screening relies on the clinical evidence and on evidence of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction. Clinical evidence can include typical organ pathologies seen in CF such as bronchiectasis or pancreatic insufficiency but often represent a broad range of severity including mild cases. CFTR dysfunction can be demonstrated using sweat chloride testing, CFTR molecular genetic analysis, or CFTR physiologic tests. On the basis of the large number of patients with bona fide CF currently followed in registries with sweat chloride levels between 30 and 40 mmol/L, the threshold considered \"intermediate\" was lowered from 40 mmol/L in the prior diagnostic guidelines to 30 mmol/L. The CF diagnosis was also discussed in the context of CFTR-related disorders in which CFTR dysfunction may be present, but the individual does not meet criteria for CF.CONCLUSIONS: CF diagnosis remains a rare but important condition that can be diagnosed when characteristic clinical features are seen in an individual with demonstrated CFTR dysfunction.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

During the day, the blades of nyctinastic plant leaves (or leaflets) assume a more or less horizontal position that optimises their ability to capture sunlight for photosynthesis. At night, the positions that the leaf blades assume, regardless of whether they arise by rising, falling or twisting, are essentially vertical. Among the ideas put forth to explain the raison d'être of foliar nyctinasty are that it: (i) improves the temperature relations of plants; (ii) helps remove surface water from foliage; (iii) prevents the disruption of photoperiodism by moonlight; and (iv) directly discourages insect herbivory. After discussing these previous hypotheses, a novel tritrophic hypothesis is introduced that proposes that foliar nyctinasty constitutes an indirect plant defence against nocturnal herbivores. It is suggested that the reduction in physical clutter that follows from nocturnal leaf closure may increase the foraging success of many types of animals that prey upon or parasitise herbivores. Predators and parasitoids generally use some combination of visual, auditory or olfactory cues to detect prey. In terrestrial environments, it is hypothesised that the vertical orientation of the blades of nyctinastic plants at night would be especially beneficial to flying nocturnal predators (e.g. bats and owls) and parasitoids whose modus operandi is death from above. The movements of prey beneath a plant with vertically oriented foliage would be visually more obvious to gleaning or swooping predators under nocturnal or crepuscular conditions. Such predators could also detect sounds made by prey better without baffling layers of foliage overhead to damp and disperse the signal. Moreover, any volatiles released by the prey would diffuse more directly to the awaiting olfactory apparatus of the predators or parasitoids. In addition to facilitating the demise of herbivores by carnivores and parasitoids, foliar nyctinasty, much like the enhanced illumination of the full moon, may mitigate feeding by nocturnal herbivores by altering their foraging behaviour. Foliar nyctinasty could also provide a competitive advantage by encouraging herbivores, seeking more cover, to forage on or around non-nyctinastic species. As an added advantage, foliar nyctinasty, by decreasing the temperature between plants through its effects on re-radiation, may slow certain types of ectothermic herbivores making them more vulnerable to predation. Foliar nyctinasty also may not solely be a behavioural adaptation against folivores; by discouraging foraging by granivores, the inclusive fitness of nyctinastic plants may be increased."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We found that nyctinasty is controlled by a periodic change of the internal concentration of leaf-opening and leaf-closing substances in the plant body.", "answer_start": 112}], "question": "What is nyctinasty in plants?", "id": "5c54d1a207647bbc4b000007_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Periodic leaf-movement of legumes is called nyctinasty and has been known since the age of Alexander the Great.

However, key regulatory ion channels and molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we identify three key ion channels in mimosoid tree Samanea saman: the slow-type anion channels, SsSLAH1 and SsSLAH3, and the Shaker-type potassium channel, SPORK2.

Here, we report the development of a selective and potent Fak degrader, PROTAC-3, which outperforms a clinical candidate, defactinib, with respect to Fak activation as well as Fak-mediated cell migration and invasion. These results underline the potential that PROTACs offer in expanding the druggable space and controlling protein functions that are not easily addressed by traditional small-molecule therapeutics."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Prompted by our observation of a correlation between PTEN loss and FAK phosphorylation in a cohort of patients with stage IV SCC, we evaluated the relevance of PTEN loss in cancer progression as well as the efficacy of a new combined treatment with the pan PI3K inhibitor buparlisip and the FAK inhibitor defactinib.", "answer_start": 382}], "question": "Which molecules are targeted by defactinib?", "id": "5c6f107c7c78d69471000051_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC) accounts for 30% of patients with NSCLC and to date, no molecular targeted agents are approved for this type of tumor. However, recent studies have revealed several oncogenic mutations in SCC patients, including an alteration of the PI3K/AKT pathway, i.e. PI3K point mutations and amplification, AKT mutations and loss or reduced PTEN expression. Prompted by our observation of a correlation between PTEN loss and FAK phosphorylation in a cohort of patients with stage IV SCC, we evaluated the relevance of PTEN loss in cancer progression as well as the efficacy of a new combined treatment with the pan PI3K inhibitor buparlisip and the FAK inhibitor defactinib. An increase in AKT and FAK phosphorylation, associated with increased proliferation and invasiveness, paralleled by the acquisition of mesenchymal markers, and overexpression of the oncomir miR-21 were observed in SKMES-1-derived cell clones with a stable reduction of PTEN. Notably, the combined treatment induced a synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation, and a significant reduction in cell migration and invasion only in cells with reduced PTEN. The molecular mechanisms underlying these findings were unraveled using a specific RTK array that showed a reduction in phosphorylation of key kinases such as JNK, GSK-3 α/β, and AMPK-α2, due to the concomitant decrease in AKT and FAK activation. In conclusion, the combination of buparlisib and defactinib was effective against cells with reduced PTEN and warrants further studies as a novel therapeutic strategy for stage IV SCC patients with loss of PTEN expression."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "PURPOSE: VS-6063 (also known as defactinib or PF-04554878) is a second-generation inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase and proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2.

This phase 1 study evaluated the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of VS-6063 in Japanese subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies in a first-in-Asian study setting.METHODS: VS-6063 was administered orally twice daily (b.i.d.) in 21-day cycles to cohorts of three subjects each with a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected on Day 1 and 15. The assessments were performed using CTCAE v4.0 for adverse events (AEs), and the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, version v1.1 (RECIST v1.1) for tumor response.RESULTS: Nine patients were treated across three dose levels (200-600 mg BID). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at any dose level. Most frequent treatment-related AEs were Grade 1/2 unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, fatigue, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Only one subject in the 200 mg BID cohort experienced reversible and transient Grade 3 unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. PK analyses confirmed that the exposure at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 400 mg BID was comparable with exposures previously reported in non-Japanese subjects. Durable stable disease of approximately 24 weeks was confirmed in two subjects (malignant mesothelioma and rectal cancer).CONCLUSIONS: VS-6063 was well tolerated at all dose levels investigated in this first-in-Asian study.

This phase I dose-escalation study was conducted in patients with advanced solid malignancies.METHODS: Using a traditional 3 + 3 design, VS-6063 was administered orally twice daily (b.i.d.) in 21-day cycles to cohorts of three to six patients. In cycle 1, a lead-in dose was administered to assess single-dose pharmacokinetics; steady-state pharmacokinetics was assessed after 15 days of continuous dosing. Dose escalation was performed in the fasted state, and repeated in two additional cohorts in the fed state.RESULTS: Forty-six patients were treated across nine dose levels (12.5-750 mg b.i.d.). Dose-limiting toxicities, comprising headache (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1) and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (n = 3), occurred at the 300- or 425-mg b.i.d. dose level and were reversible. Frequent adverse events included nausea (37 %), fatigue (33 %), vomiting (28 %), diarrhea (22 %) and headache (22 %). A maximum-tolerated dose was not defined. Dose escalation was stopped at the 750-mg b.i.d. dose due to decreased serum exposure in the 500- and 750-mg versus 300- and 425-mg groups. Food delayed the time to peak serum concentration without affecting serum drug exposure. No radiographic responses were reported. Disease stabilization at ~12 weeks occurred in six of 37 (16 %) patients receiving doses ≥100 mg b.i.d.CONCLUSIONS: VS-6063 has an acceptable safety profile. Treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate, and reversible.
