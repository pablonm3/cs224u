We assessed the effect of siponimod, a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor1,5 modulator, on disability progression in patients with SPMS.METHODS: This event-driven and exposure-driven, double-blind, phase 3 trial was done at 292 hospital clinics and specialised multiple sclerosis centres in 31 countries. Using interactive response technology to assign numbers linked to treatment arms, patients (age 18-60 years) with SPMS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 3·0-6·5 were randomly assigned (2:1) to once daily oral siponimod 2 mg or placebo for up to 3 years or until the occurrence of a prespecified number of confirmed disability progression (CDP) events. The primary endpoint was time to 3-month CDP. Efficacy was assessed for the full analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned and treated patients); safety was assessed for the safety set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01665144.FINDINGS: 1651 patients were randomly assigned between Feb 5, 2013, and June 2, 2015 (1105 to the siponimod group, and 546 to the placebo group). One patient did not sign the consent form, and five patients did not receive study drug, all of whom were in the siponimod group. 1645 patients were included in the analyses (1099 in the siponimod group and 546 in the placebo). At baseline, the mean time since first multiple sclerosis symptoms was 16·8 years (SD 8·3), and the mean time since conversion to SPMS was 3·8 years (SD 3·5); 1055 (64%) patients had not relapsed in the previous 2 years, and 918 (56%) of 1651 needed walking assistance. 903 (82%) patients receiving siponimod and 424 (78%) patients receiving placebo completed the study. 288 (26%) of 1096 patients receiving siponimod and 173 (32%) of 545 patients receiving placebo had 3-month CDP (hazard ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·65-0·95; relative risk reduction 21%; p=0·013). Adverse events occurred in 975 (89%) of 1099 patients receiving siponimod versus 445 (82%) of 546 patients receiving placebo; serious adverse events were reported for 197 (18%) patients in the siponimod group versus 83 (15%) patients in the placebo group. Lymphopenia, increased liver transaminase concentration, bradycardia and bradyarrhythmia at treatment initiation, macular oedema, hypertension, varicella zoster reactivation, and convulsions occurred more frequently with siponimod than with placebo. Initial dose titration mitigated cardiac first-dose effects. Frequencies of infections, malignancies, and fatalities did not differ between groups.INTERPRETATION: Siponimod reduced the risk of disability progression with a safety profile similar to that of other S1P modulators and is likely to be a useful treatment for SPMS.FUNDING: Novartis Pharma AG.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Although most MS patients have a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS) at disease onset, a substantial proportion later develop chronic progression, termed secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Approximately 10% of MS patients experience chronic progression from disease onset, termed primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Although several disease-modifying treatment (DMT) options exist for relapsing forms of this disease, DMT options are few for progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS). Herein, we strive to define progressive MS, review major clinical trials aimed at progressive MS, and delineate potential strategies in the management of progressive MS.RECENT FINDINGS: In 2017, the first DMT for PPMS, the B lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody, ocrelizumab, came to market. Ocrelizumab reduced 12-week confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 24% versus placebo. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, reduced 3-month CDP by 21% versus placebo in SPMS. Ibudilast slowed brain atrophy in PPMS and SPMS patients in a multicenter phase 2b study. Smaller early phase studies of alpha-lipoic acid and simvastatin each found slowing of rate of whole brain atrophy in SPMS patients. Reasons now exist for optimism in the search for DMTs for progressive MS. It remains a challenge to identify outcome measures that accurately reflect the underlying pathology in progressive MS, which is less inflammatory and more degenerative than RRMS."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "A high incidence of hemangiosarcoma (HSA) was observed in mice treated for 2 years with siponimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) functional antagonist, while no such tumors were observed in rats under the same treatment conditions.

In 3-month rat (90 mg/kg/day) and 9-month mouse (25 and 75 mg/kg/day) in vivo mechanistic studies, vascular endothelial cell (VEC) activation was observed in both species, but VEC proliferation and persistent increases in circulating placental growth factor 2 (PLGF2) were only seen in the mouse. In mice, these effects were sustained over the 9-month study duration, while in rats increased mitotic gene expression was present at day 3 only and PLGF2 was induced only during the first week of treatment. In the mouse, the persistent VEC activation, mitosis induction, and PLGF2 stimulation likely led to sustained neo-angiogenesis which over life-long treatment may result in HSA formation. In rats, despite sustained VEC activation, the transient mitotic and PLGF2 stimuli did not result in the formation of HSA. In vitro, the mouse and rat primary endothelial cell cultures mirrored their respective in vivo findings for cell proliferation and PLGF2 release. Human VECs, like rat cells, were unresponsive to siponimod treatment with no proliferative response and no release of PLGF2 at all tested concentrations. Hence, it is suggested that the human cells also reproduce a lack of in vivo response to siponimod.

Within peptide #1 substitution of the same hydrophobic amino acids with other hydrophobic amino acids or substitution of polar amino acids with charged or polar amino acids had little effect on fusion. Thus peptides #1 and #2 remain likely candidates for the MHV fusion peptide.

Three protein bands were identical in pI and one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain.

Further, the interaction of nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake is higher than in healthy people. In case of repeated or continued radioiodine release, more than one dose of potassium iodide may be necessary and be taken up to 1 week. Repeated iodine thyroid blocking obviously is not harmful. Side effects of iodine thyroid blocking should not be overestimated; there is little evidence for adverse effects in adults. Newborns and babies, however, may be more sensitive to side effects.

Acute depletion of Gli1 in postnatal NSCs by short-hairpin RNA decreased proliferation, whereas germline deletion of Gli1 did not affect NSC proliferation, suggesting a difference in mechanisms of Gli1 compensation that may be developmentally dependent. To determine whether Gli1 was sufficient to enhance NSC proliferation, we overexpressed this mitogen and were surprised to find that Gli1 resulted in decreased proliferation, accumulation of NSCs in the G2/M phase of cell cycle, and apoptosis. In contrast, Gli1-expressing lineage-restricted neural precursors demonstrated a 4.5-fold proliferation enhancement. Expression analyses of Gli1-expressing NSCs identified significant induction of Gadd45a and decreased cyclin A2 and Stag1 mRNA, genes involved in the G2-M transition and apoptosis.

We observed a global decrease in K27me3 in as little as 3 days after differentiation of mouse ES cells induced by retinoic acid (RA) treatment. The global levels of the histone K27 methyltransferase EZH2 also decreased with RA treatment. A loss of EZH2 binding and K27me3 was observed locally on PRC2 target genes induced after 3 days of RA, including Nestin. In contrast, direct RA-responsive genes that are rapidly induced, such as Hoxa1, showed a loss of EZH2 binding and K27me3 after only a few hours of RA treatment. Following differentiation induced by leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) withdrawal without RA, Hoxa1 was not transcriptionally activated. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of EZH2 resulted in loss of K27me3 during LIF withdrawal, but the Hoxa1 gene remained transcriptionally silent after loss of this repressive mark. Induction of histone hyperacetylation overrode the repressive K27me3 modification and resulted in Hoxa1 gene expression. Together, these data show that there are multiple temporal phases of derepression of PRC2 target genes during ES cell differentiation and that other epigenetic marks (specifically, increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4), in addition to derepression, are important for gene-specific transcriptional activation.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3 levels.

At least 471,011 domains in the mouse genome acquire H3K27me3 when DNAme is diminished. Of these 466,563 have been shown to be fully methylated in wildtype ES cells, indicating the effects of DNAme on H3K27me3 are direct. In a reciprocal experiment, we examine the effect loss of PRC2 has on the placement of DNAme. In contrast to the global antagonism DNAme has on the placement of H3K27me3, loss of H3K27me3 has a modest effect on DNAme, with only 4% of genes undergoing changes in DNAme, including 861 showing increases and 552 showing losses of overall DNAme.

Candidate and genome-wide RNA expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of Ezh2(NK) heart identified genes directly repressed by EZH2. Among these were the potent cell cycle inhibitors Ink4a/b (inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 A and B), the upregulation of which was associated with decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation in Ezh2(NK). EZH2-repressed genes were enriched for transcriptional regulators of noncardiomyocyte expression programs such as Pax6, Isl1, and Six1. EZH2 was also required for proper spatiotemporal regulation of cardiac gene expression, because Hcn4, Mlc2a, and Bmp10 were inappropriately upregulated in ventricular RNA. PRC2 was also required later in heart development, as indicated by cardiomyocyte-restricted TNT-Cre inactivation of the PRC2 subunit Eed. However, Ezh2 inactivation by TNT-Cre did not cause an overt phenotype, likely because of functional redundancy with Ezh1. Thus, early Ezh2 inactivation by Nk2-5(Cre) caused later disruption of cardiomyocyte gene expression and heart development.CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a previously undescribed role of EZH2 in regulating heart formation and shows that perturbation of the epigenetic landscape early in cardiogenesis has sustained disruptive effects at later developmental stages."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We found that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me2/me3), binds to its own site of methylation.", "answer_start": 743}], "question": "Which epigenetic mark is deposited by PRC2?", "id": "5d35ef017bc3fee31f000001_008", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Maintenance of gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA- and histone-methylation is essential for preserving cellular identity and function. Multiplication of eukaryotic cells requires that the DNA content of the cell is duplicated through replication, which is coupled to incorporation of de novo synthesized core histones into nucleosomal structures. One of the challenging questions in biology is to explain how the organism ensures that regulatory epigenetic marks, once established, are transferred from one cell generation to the next. Based on studies in our laboratory, we have recently proposed a model for how the methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) can be stably transmitted through the cell division cycle. We found that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me2/me3), binds to its own site of methylation. Moreover, our results suggested that maintenance of transcriptional repression by PRC2 requires the binding of the PRC2 complex to H3K27me3/me2. Based on these two key observations we propose that PRC2 is able to copy the mark from an old parental H3 molecule to a newly synthesized H3 molecule as DNA replication proceeds.

Using a heterologous reporter system, we show that transient recruitment of the PRC2 complex to chromatin, upstream of the transcriptional start site, is sufficient to maintain repression through endogenous PRC2 during subsequent cell divisions. Thus, we suggest that once the H3K27me3 is established, it recruits the PRC2 complex to maintain the mark at sites of DNA replication, leading to methylation of H3K27 on the daughter strands during incorporation of newly synthesized histones. This mechanism ensures maintenance of the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark in proliferating cells, not only during DNA replication when histones synthesized de novo are incorporated, but also outside S phase, thereby preserving chromatin structure and transcriptional programs."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": []}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " Cutaneous manifestations of SLE are frequently the presenting symptoms, typically noted in the classic malar \"butterfly\" rash; ", "answer_start": 306}], "question": "What disease is associated with a Malar rash?", "id": "5e4bed1c6d0a27794100002b_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may involve any number of organ systems and varies greatly in the severity and type of involvement.

We compared their efficacy in the Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study (CADISS), with the additional aim of establishing the true risk of recurrent stroke.METHODS: We did this randomised trial at hospitals with specialised stroke or neurology services (39 in the UK and seven in Australia). We included patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection with onset of symptoms within the past 7 days. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an automated telephone randomisation service to receive antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulant drugs (specific treatment decided by the local clinician) for 3 months. Patients and clinicians were not masked to allocation, but investigators assessing endpoints were. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral stroke or death in the intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered with EUDract (2006-002827-18) and ISRN (CTN44555237).FINDINGS: We enrolled 250 participants (118 carotid, 132 vertebral). Mean time to randomisation was 3·65 days (SD 1·91). The major presenting symptoms were stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n=224) and local symptoms (headache, neck pain, or Horner's syndrome; n=26). 126 participants were assigned to antiplatelet treatment versus 124 to anticoagulant treatment. Overall, four (2%) of 250 patients had stroke recurrence (all ipsilateral). Stroke or death occurred in three (2%) of 126 patients versus one (1%) of 124 (odds ratio [OR] 0·335, 95% CI 0·006-4·233; p=0·63). There were no deaths, but one major bleeding (subarachnoid haemorrhage) in the anticoagulant group. Central review of imaging failed to confirm dissection in 52 patients. Preplanned per-protocol analysis excluding these patients showed stroke or death in three (3%) of 101 patients in the antiplatelet group versus one (1%) of 96 patients in the anticoagulant group (OR 0·346, 95% CI 0·006-4·390; p=0·66).INTERPRETATION: We found no difference in efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs at preventing stroke and death in patients with symptomatic carotid and vertebral artery dissection but stroke was rare in both groups, and much rarer than reported in some observational studies. Diagnosis of dissection was not confirmed after review in many cases, suggesting that radiographic criteria are not always correctly applied in routine clinical practice.FUNDING: Stroke Association.Copyright © 2015 Markus et al.

The primary endpoint was recurrent stroke at 3 months. A systematic review was performed, and results of published studies included in a meta-analysis with the CADISS-NR results.RESULTS: In CADISS-NR, one patient in each group had recurrent ischemic stroke (antiplatelet 1/59 [1.69% ], anticoagulation 1/28 [3.57%]). At the primary endpoint of 3 months, 3 (5.08%) antiplatelet patients had recurrent TIA, compared with none in the anticoagulation group. For meta-analysis, there were data from 40 nonrandomized studies including 1,636 patients. There was no significant difference between the 2 treatments in recurrent stroke risk (antiplatelet 13/499 [2.6%], anticoagulant 20/1,137 [1.8%], odds ratio [OR] 1.49) or risk of death (antiplatelet 5/499 [1.00%], anticoagulant 9/1,137 [0.80%], OR 1.27).CONCLUSION: There is no evidence for superiority of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy in prevention of stoke after carotid and vertebral artery dissection; however, all data are from nonrandomized studies and randomized studies are required. The nonrandomized CADISS data show a lower rate of recurrent stroke than reported in some previous studies.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: www.dissection.co.uk, ISRNCTN44555237."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Although optimal treatment for VAD is unknown, the Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study (CADISS) is an ongoing randomised multicentre prospective study comparing antiplatelet therapy with anticoagulation for patients with both carotid artery dissection and VAD.

It can present with local symptoms or stroke/transient ischaemic attacks. Following presentation there is a risk of stroke, particularly in the first month following presentation. The mechanism of stroke is believed to be thromboembolic in the majority of cases. Many clinicians anticoagulate patients with cervical dissection for 3-6 months. This is not evidence based and is supported by a paucity of data and no data from randomised control trials.AIMS: CADISS is a prospective multicentre randomised-controlled trial in acute (within 7 days of onset) carotid and vertebral artery dissection. Intracerebral artery dissection is excluded.DESIGN: Patients are randomised to antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, dipyridamole or clopidogrel alone or in dual combination) or anticoagulation therapy [heparin followed by warfarin aiming for an International Normalised Ratio (INR) in the range 2-3] for at least 3 months. Treatment is open-label.STUDY OUTCOME: The primary end-point is ipsilateral stroke or death within 3 months from randomisation. Secondary end-points include any TIA or stroke, major bleeding and presence of residual stenosis at 3 months (>50%). All neuroimaging and serious adverse events will be adjudicated blinded to treatment. An initial feasibility phase of 250 subjects will allow us to determine whether *there are sufficient clinical end-points to provide the power to determine a treatment effect and *adequate numbers of patients can be recruited. The feasibility phase will be continued into a fully powered definitive treatment trial. Initial power calculations based on limited natural history data suggest a sample size of approximately 3000. Sample size calculations will be refined once the frequency of outcome events during the feasibility phase is known."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Here we show that PIWI, an ARGONAUTE/PIWI protein family member that binds to Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), strongly and specifically interacts with heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a), a central player in heterochromatic gene silencing.", "answer_start": 524}], "question": "Which is the effect of the HP1a protein on chromatin?", "id": "5d35f1267bc3fee31f000004_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The interface between cellular systems involving small noncoding RNAs and epigenetic change remains largely unexplored in metazoans.

Here we show that PIWI, an ARGONAUTE/PIWI protein family member that binds to Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), strongly and specifically interacts with heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a), a central player in heterochromatic gene silencing. The HP1a dimer binds a PxVxL-type motif in the N-terminal domain of PIWI. This motif is required in fruit flies for normal silencing of transgenes embedded in heterochromatin. We also demonstrate that PIWI, like HP1a, is itself a chromatin-associated protein whose distribution in polytene chromosomes overlaps with HP1a and appears to be RNA dependent.

A general model has been proposed for heterochromatin formation and epigenetic gene silencing in different species that implies an essential role for HP1a. According to the model, histone methyltransferase enzymes (HMTases) methylate the histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me), creating selective binding sites for itself and the chromodomain of HP1a. This complex is thought to form a higher order chromatin state that represses gene activity. It has also been found that HP1a plays a role in telomere capping. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that HP1a is present at many euchromatic sites along polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, including the developmental and heat-shock-induced puffs, and that this protein can be removed from these sites by in vivo RNase treatment, thus suggesting an association of HP1a with the transcripts of many active genes. To test this suggestion, we performed an extensive screening by RIP-chip assay (RNA-immunoprecipitation on microarrays), and we found that HP1a is associated with transcripts of more than one hundred euchromatic genes. An expression analysis in HP1a mutants shows that HP1a is required for positive regulation of these genes. Cytogenetic and molecular assays show that HP1a also interacts with the well known proteins DDP1, HRB87F, and PEP, which belong to different classes of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) involved in RNA processing. Surprisingly, we found that all these hnRNP proteins also bind heterochromatin and are dominant suppressors of position effect variegation. Together, our data show novel and unexpected functions for HP1a and hnRNPs proteins. All these proteins are in fact involved both in RNA transcript processing and in heterochromatin formation.

To probe the dependence of HP1a binding on H3K9me, its dependence on these three HKMTs, and the division of labor between the HKMTs, we have examined correlations between HP1a binding and H3K9me patterns in wild type and null mutants of these HKMTs. We show here that Su(var)3-9 controls H3K9me-dependent binding of HP1a in pericentromeric regions, while Setdb1 controls it in cytological region 2L:31 and (together with POF) in chromosome 4. HP1a binds to the promoters and within bodies of active genes in these three regions. More importantly, however, HP1a binding at promoters of active genes is independent of H3K9me and POF. Rather, it is associated with heterochromatin protein 2 (HP2) and open chromatin.

Although Eyg has been shown to act as a repressor, nothing is known about the mechanism by which it represses its target genes. Here, we show that Eyg forms a protein complex with heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). Both proteins bind to the same chromatin regions on polytene chromosomes and act cooperatively to suppress variegation and mediate gene silencing. In addition, Eyg binds to a wingless (wg) enhancer region, recruiting HP1a to assemble a closed, heterochromatin-like conformation that represses transcription of the wg gene. We describe here the evidence that suggests that Eyg, encoded by eyegone (eyg), represses wingless (wg) during eye development by association with HP1a. We show that Eyg forms a protein complex with HP1a and both proteins colocalize on salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Using position effect variegation (PEV) experiments, we demonstrated that eyg has a dose-dependent effect on heterochromatin gene silencing and identified a genetic interaction with HP1a in this process. We further demonstrated that HP1a binds to the same wg enhancer element as Eyg. DNase I sensitivity assays indicated that this enhancer region has a closed heterochromatin-like conformation, which becomes open in eyg mutants. In these mutants, much less HP1a binds to the wg enhancer region, as shown by ChIP experiments. Furthermore, as previously described for Eyg, a reduction in the amount of HP1a in the eye imaginal disc derepresses wg. Together, our results suggest a model in which Eyg specifically binds to the wg enhancer region, recruiting HP1a to that site. The recruitment of HP1a prevents transcription by favoring a closed, heterochromatin-like structure.

Transfer of DP T lymphocytes into thymectomized SCID mice demonstrates that these cells undergo post-thymic maturation in the peripheral lymphoid organs and that their CD4 cell progeny is fully immunocompetent, as judged by its ability to survive and expand in peripheral lymphoid organs, to proliferate in response to CD3 ligation, and to produce IL-2 upon stimulation."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Thymocytes with reduced levels of expression of CD4 and/or CD8 were more abundant in transgenic (tg) mice and became increasingly more so with age.

This hypertrophy is associated with increased absolute numbers of all thymocyte types, and with increased cortical and medullary cellularity. In the thymic medulla, increased compartmentalization of the major thymic stromal cell types and expansion of thymic epithelial cell population is observed. Neither an increased rate of immature thymocyte division nor a decreased rate of immature thymocyte death was able to account for the observed hypertrophy. Thymocytes with reduced levels of expression of CD4 and/or CD8 were more abundant in transgenic (tg) mice and became increasingly more so with age. These thymic SP and DP populations with reduced levels of CD4 and/or CD8 markers had a lower rate of apoptosis in the tg than in the non-tg mice. The rate of export of mature thymocytes to peripheral lymphoid organs was less in tg animals relative to the pool of available mature cells, particularly for the increasingly abundant CD4lo population. We therefore suggest that mature thymocytes that would normally die in the thymus gradually accumulated in E7 transgenic animals, perhaps as a consequence of exposure to a hypertrophied E7-expressing thymic epithelium or to factors secreted by this expanded thymic stromal cell population. The K14E7 transgenic mouse thus provides a unique model to study effects of the thymic epithelial cell compartment on thymus development and involution."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Importance: Galcanezumab (LY2951742), a monoclonal antibody against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is one of a novel class of new medicines for migraine prevention.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the target of galcanezumab?", "id": "5e460f823f54159529000006_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Importance: Galcanezumab (LY2951742), a monoclonal antibody against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is one of a novel class of new medicines for migraine prevention.Objective: To assess whether at least 1 dose of galcanezumab was superior to placebo for episodic migraine prevention.Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the United States (July 7, 2014, to August 19, 2015) in clinics of 37 licensed physicians with a specialty including, but not limited to, psychiatry, neurology, internal medicine, and primary care. Subcutaneous injections of galcanezumab, 5, 50, 120, or 300 mg, or placebo were given monthly during the 3-month treatment period.

MERS-CoV causes high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection, and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals.

We have demonstrated that M, 4a, 4b proteins and Plppro of MERS-CoV inhibit the type I interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways and therefore facilitate innate immune evasion. In addition, nonstructural protein 4a (NSP4a), NSP4b, and NSP15 inhibit double-stranded RNA sensors. Therefore, the mentioned proteins limit early induction of IFN and cause rapid apoptosis of macrophages.
