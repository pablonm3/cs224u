Here we present a machine learning classifier to prioritize ADRs for approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by combining chemical structure (CS) and gene expression (GE) features. The GE data is from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 dataset that measured changes in GE before and after treatment of human cells with over 20 000 small-molecule compounds including most of the FDA-approved drugs. Using various benchmarking methods, we show that the integration of GE data with the CS of the drugs can significantly improve the predictability of ADRs. Moreover, transforming GE features to enrichment vectors of biological terms further improves the predictive capability of the classifiers. The most predictive biological-term features can assist in understanding the drug mechanisms of action. Finally, we applied the classifier to all  >20 000 small-molecules profiled, and developed a web portal for browsing and searching predictive small-molecule/ADR connections.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The interface for the adverse event predictions for the  >20 000 LINCS compounds is available at http://maayanlab.net/SEP-L1000/ CONTACT: avi.maayan@mssm.eduSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author 2016.

Recently, resources such as the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 database provide gene expression profiles induced by various chemical and genetic perturbations and thereby make it possible to analyze the relationship between compounds and gene targets at a genome-wide scale. Current approaches for comparing the expression profiles are based on pairwise connectivity mapping analysis. However, this method makes the simple assumption that the effect of a drug treatment is similar to knocking down its single target gene. Since many compounds can bind multiple targets, the pairwise mapping ignores the combined effects of multiple targets, and therefore fails to detect many potential targets of the compounds.RESULTS: We propose an algorithm to find sets of gene knock-downs that induce gene expression changes similar to a drug treatment. Assuming that the effects of gene knock-downs are additive, we propose a novel bipartite block-wise sparse multi-task learning model with super-graph structure (BBSS-MTL) for multi-target drug repositioning that overcomes the restrictive assumptions of connectivity mapping analysis.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method BBSS-MTL is more accurate for predicting potential drug targets than the simple pairwise connectivity mapping analysis on five datasets generated from different cancer cell lines.AVAILABILITY: The code can be obtained at http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/liminli/codes ."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and XIAP) ", "answer_start": 1002}], "question": "Is the protein MCL-1 anti-apoptotic?", "id": "5e6e8600c6a8763d23000002_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Fenvalerate (Fen), a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used in agricultural, domestic and veterinary applications. Fen induces abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis, which are linked to its hazardous effects. However, this view is controversial and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, the effects of Fen on cadmium (Cd)-induced apoptosis and the associated molecular mechanisms were investigated in human myeloid leukemia U937 cells. U937 cells were treated with 50 μm cadmium chloride (CdCl2 ) with or without Fen pretreatment at 1-50 μm. Apoptosis was evaluated by externalization of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bcl-2 family members were determined by western blot analysis. The results revealed that pretreatment with Fen at 20 μm for 12 hours significantly inhibited Cd-induced apoptosis. Decreased expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Noxa and Bid) and increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and XIAP) were observed after combined treatment with Fen and CdCl2 . Phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was increased, while phosphorylation of JNK was decreased by the combined treatment, compared with CdCl2 treatment alone. In conclusion, Fen decreased apoptotic sensitivity induced by Cd in U937 cells. This effect was associated with activation of ERK and AKT, suppression of JNK and changes in expression of Bcl-2 family proteins and XIAP. The present findings suggest a potential influence of Fen on Cd toxicity via suppression of apoptosis.

Despite of general chemotherapy, relapse and mortality are common, highlighting the need for the development of novel targeted drugs or combination of therapeutic regimens. Recently, several drugs that target the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, especially the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, have demonstrated notable therapeutic effects in relapsed/refractory patients, which indicate that pharmacological inhibition of BCR pathway holds promise in MCL treatment. Here, we have developed a novel irreversible BTK inhibitor, PLS-123, that has more potent and selective anti-tumor activity than ibrutinib in vitro and in vivo. Using in vitro screening, we discovered that the combination of PLS-123 and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus exert synergistic activity in attenuating proliferation and motility of MCL cell lines. Simultaneous inhibition of BTK and mTOR resulted in marked induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, which were accompanied by upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved PARP and Bax), repression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and XIAP), and downregulation of regulators of the G1/S phase transition (CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and Cyclin D1). Gene expression profile analysis revealed simultaneous treatment with these agents led to inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3, AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and SGK1 expression.

Despite their similarities, there is emerging evidence for non-redundant roles of the circulating yet scarce basophils and tissue-resident mast cells, respectively. Because of their importance in allergic pathogenesis, specific induction of apoptosis in basophils and mast cells may represent an interesting novel treatment strategy. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-3 serves as a key factor for basophil and mouse mast cell survival. Interleukin-3 increases the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, such as BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1; however, little is known how strongly these individual proteins contribute to basophil survival. Here, we were applying small molecule inhibitors called BH3 mimetics, some of which show remarkable success in cancer treatments, to neutralize the function of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. We observed that expression levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins do not necessarily correlate with their respective importance for basophil survival. Whereas naive in vitro-differentiated mouse basophils efficiently died upon BCL-2 or BCL-XL inhibition, interleukin-3 priming rendered the cells highly resistant toward apoptosis, and this could only be overcome upon combined targeting of BCL-2 and BCL-XL. Of note, human basophils differed from mouse basophils as they depended on BCL-2 and MCL-1, but not on BCL-XL, for their survival at steady state. On the other hand, and in contrast to mouse basophils, MCL-1 proved critical in mediating survival of interleukin-3 stimulated mouse mast cells, whereas BCL-XL seemed dispensable. Taken together, our results indicate that by choosing the right combination of BH3 mimetic compounds, basophils and mast cells can be efficiently killed, even after stimulation with potent pro-survival cytokines such as interleukin-3. Because of the tolerable side effects of BH3 mimetics, targeting basophils or mast cells for apoptosis opens interesting possibilities for novel treatment approaches."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " Its onset preceded the rearrangement of TCR genes, as Xlr expression was conserved in thymus cells from RAG1(0/0) mice.

The lower expression of Xlr on day 13 of fetal development, the bright Thy1+ phenotype of Xlr-positive cells, their large size, and their absence from subcapsular areas suggest that Xlr expression must be turned on within the thymus and not in prethymic precursors. From day 16 of gestation, Xlr expression decreased markedly. At birth and later, Xlr(high) cells were mostly large cells scattered throughout the cortical area. As shown by confocal microscopy, expression of Xlr closely overlapped that of SATB1, which binds special AT-rich DNA sequences associated with the nuclear matrix and plays an important regulatory role for many genes.

There is currently no effective treatment for this tumor. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is effective for a variety of tumors, but not for GBM. The authors' goal was to demonstrate that bortezomib can be effective in the orthotopic GBM murine model if the appropriate method of drug delivery is used. In this study the Alzet mini-osmotic pump was used to bring the drug directly to the tumor in the brain, circumventing the blood-brain barrier; thus making bortezomib an effective treatment for GBM. METHODS The 2 human glioma cell lines, U87 and U251, were labeled with luciferase and used in the subcutaneous and intracranial in vivo tumor models. Glioma cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank, or intracranially into the frontal cortex of athymic nude mice. Mice bearing intracranial glioma tumors were implanted with an Alzet mini-osmotic pump containing different doses of bortezomib. The Alzet pumps were introduced directly into the tumor bed in the brain. Survival was documented for mice with intracranial tumors. RESULTS Glioma cells were sensitive to bortezomib at nanomolar quantities in vitro. In the subcutaneous in vivo xenograft tumor model, bortezomib given intravenously was effective in reducing tumor progression. However, in the intracranial glioma model, bortezomib given systemically did not affect survival. By sharp contrast, animals treated with bortezomib intracranially at the tumor site exhibited significantly increased survival. CONCLUSIONS Bypassing the blood-brain barrier by using the osmotic pump resulted in an increase in the efficacy of bortezomib for the treatment of intracranial tumors. Thus, the intratumoral administration of bortezomib into the cranial cavity is an effective approach for glioma therapy."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The phase III trial in small cell lung cancer was discontinued when the results of study 140 were released in February 2001 showing that marimastat was not significantly more effective than placebo in prolonging the survival of small cell lung cancer patients.", "answer_start": 1961}], "question": "Is marimastat effective for small-cell lung cancer?", "id": "5e476da1d14c9f295d000002_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Marimastat [BB 2516, TA 2516] is a second-generation anticancer drug originally developed with British Biotech in Europe and North America.

Marimastat also has collagenase- and angiogenesis-inhibiting properties. British Biotech and Schering-Plough have signed an agreement enabling the latter to develop and market marimastat in North America and Europe. Under the terms of the agreement, British Biotech will receive an up-front license fee of 4 million US dollars and a 4 million US dollars equity investment in British Biotech by Schering-Plough. Schering-Plough holds rights to marimastat in all countries other than the Far East and Japan. The two companies are considering asking the FDA for accelerated approval in gastric cancer based on the secondary endpoint of progression-free survival. Marimastat is licensed to Tanabe Seiyaku in Japan, where phase II clinical trials are underway for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer and lung cancer. Further phase II trials in other tumour types are planned. The commencement of phase II trials in Japan resulted in a milestone payment of 5 million US dollars to British Biotech from Tanabe Seiyaku. Tanabe Seiyaku also holds rights to marimastat in the Far East. Marimastat has been in pivotal phase III trials in glioblastoma, breast, ovarian and small and non-small cell lung cancer, but these trials have all been discontinued because marimastat failed to show superior efficacy over either standard chemotherapy or placebo. Results from the marimastat 131 trial in patients with glioblastoma, for example, indicated that marimastat was no better than placebo at prolonging survival in these cancer patients. In June 2000, when the results of this study were released, shares in British Biotech fell 21.6% to just 19 pence per share. The phase III trial in small cell lung cancer was discontinued when the results of study 140 were released in February 2001 showing that marimastat was not significantly more effective than placebo in prolonging the survival of small cell lung cancer patients.

British Biotech has also conducted a phase III placebo-controlled study of marimastat as monotherapy in patients with inoperable gastric cancer at 37 centres throughout Europe. Results from this trial indicated that it did not achieve its primary endpoint of a statistically significant survival benefit over placebo. However, data collected during the follow-up period have shown increases in survival benefit in the treatment group in addition to a significant improvement in disease-free progression, the secondary endpoint of the trial. Development of marimastat for this indication is ongoing. In May 2001, British Biotech reported data from an interim analysis of results from the remaining phase III study in pancreatic cancer (study 183) that showed no patient benefit for marimastat recipients compared with gemcitabine.

One of the earliest postzygotic isolating barriers to arise between incipient species is the sterility of the heterogametic sex in interspecies' hybrids. Four genes that underlie hybrid sterility have been identified in animals: Odysseus, JYalpha, and Overdrive in Drosophila and Prdm9 (Meisetz) in mice. Mouse Prdm9 encodes a protein with a KRAB motif, a histone methyltransferase domain and several zinc fingers. The difference of a single zinc finger distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid sterility from those that do not. We find that concerted evolution and positive selection have rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc fingers across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of positive selection in Prdm9 zinc fingers imply that rapid evolution has acted on the interface between the Prdm9 protein and the DNA sequences to which it binds. Similar patterns are apparent for Prdm9 zinc fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates. Indeed, allelic variation at the DNA-binding positions of human PRDM9 zinc fingers show significant association with decreased risk of infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a role in determining male sterility both between species (mouse) and within species (human). The recurrent episodes of positive selection acting on Prdm9 suggest that the DNA sequences to which it binds must also be evolving rapidly. Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying DNA sequences, but argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical model in which incompatibilities between Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite DNAs provide the molecular basis for Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility.

At least part of the problem is technical; it is difficult to detect and quantify interstrand cross-links when the same agent forms both cross-links and single strand breaks because the detection of interstrand cross-links generally involves a denaturation step. Our group has studied the induction of interstrand cross-links following irradiation of DNA containing bromouracil at specific sites. We found that the formation of interstrand cross-links requires the presence of a few (3-5) mismatched bases, comprising the bromouracil. In the absence of mismatched bases, no radiation-induced cross-linking was observed; however, even in the absence of bromouracil, cross-linking still occurred, albeit at a lower efficiency. Our molecular modelling studies demonstrate that the mobility of the bases in the mismatched region is essential for the cross-linking process. Thus, our hypothesis is that ionizing radiation induces DNA interstrand cross-links in non-hybridized regions of DNA. Some obvious examples of such DNA regions are replication forks, transcription bubbles and the D-loop of telomeres. However, an abundance of studies have made it clear that there must be many single-stranded regions in the genome, such as hairpins and cruciforms. For example, alpha satellite DNA, in centromere regions of human chromosomes, forms hairpins. Thus, a variety of non-B DNA structures (hairpins, slipped DNA and tetrahelical structures) exist in the genome and should be susceptible to the formation of radiation-induced interstrand cross-links.

In order to bridge this gap between DSBs and deletions, we critically reviewed published data on mechanisms pertaining to: (a) repair of DNA DSBs (from basic studies in this area); (b) formation of naturally occurring structural variation (SV) - especially of deletions - in the human genome (from genomic studies) and (c) radiation-induced mutations and structural chromosomal aberrations in mammalian somatic cells (from radiation mutagenesis and radiation cytogenetic studies). The specific aim was to assess the relative importance of the postulated mechanisms in generating deletions in the human genome and examine whether empirical data on radiation-induced deletions in mouse germ cells are consistent with predictions of these mechanisms. The mechanisms include (a) NHEJ, a DSB repair process that does not require any homology and which functions in all stages of the cell cycle (and is of particular relevance in G0/G1); (b) MMEJ, also a DSB repair process but which requires microhomology and which presumably functions in all cell cycle stages; (c) NAHR, a recombination-based DSB repair mechanism which operates in prophase I of meiosis in germ cells; (d) MMBIR, a microhomology-mediated, replication-based mechanism which operates in the S phase of the cell cycle, and (e) strand slippage during replication (involved in the origin of small insertions and deletions (INDELs). Our analysis permits the inference that, between them, these five mechanisms can explain nearly all naturally occurring deletions of different sizes identified in the human genome, NAHR and MMBIR being potentially more versatile in this regard. With respect to radiation-induced deletions, the basic studies suggest that those arising as a result of the operation of NHEJ/MMEJ processes, as currently formulated, are expected to be relatively small. However, data on induced mutations in mouse spermatogonial stem cells (irradiation in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and DSB repair presumed to be via NHEJ predominantly) show that most are associated with deletions of different sizes, some in the megabase range. There is thus a 'discrepancy' between what the basic studies suggest and the empirical observations in mutagenesis studies. This discrepancy, however, is only an apparent but not a real one. It can be resolved by considering the issue of deletions in the broader context of and in conjunction with the organization of chromatin in chromosomes and nuclear architecture, the conceptual framework for which already exists in studies carried out during the past fifteen years or so. In this paper, we specifically hypothesize that repair of DSBs induced in chromatin loops may offer a basis to explain the induction of deletions of different sizes and suggest an approach to test the hypothesis. We emphasize that the bridging of the gap between induced DSB and resulting deletions of different sizes is critical for current efforts in computational modeling of genetic risks."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "INTERPRETATION: Natalizumab treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis did not reduce progression on the primary multicomponent disability endpoint in part 1, but it did reduce progression on its upper-limb component.", "answer_start": 2879}], "question": "Does natalizumab improve disease course of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis?", "id": "5e48b1ddd14c9f295d000012_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Although several disease-modifying treatments are available for relapsing multiple sclerosis, treatment effects have been more modest in progressive multiple sclerosis and have been observed particularly in actively relapsing subgroups or those with lesion activity on imaging. We sought to assess whether natalizumab slows disease progression in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, independent of relapses.METHODS: ASCEND was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (part 1) with an optional 2 year open-label extension (part 2). Enrolled patients aged 18-58 years were natalizumab-naive and had secondary progressive multiple sclerosis for 2 years or more, disability progression unrelated to relapses in the previous year, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of 3·0-6·5. In part 1, patients from 163 sites in 17 countries were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 300 mg intravenous natalizumab or placebo every 4 weeks for 2 years. Patients were stratified by site and by EDSS score (3·0-5·5 vs 6·0-6·5). Patients completing part 1 could enrol in part 2, in which all patients received natalizumab every 4 weeks until the end of the study. Throughout both parts, patients and staff were masked to the treatment received in part 1. The primary outcome in part 1 was the proportion of patients with sustained disability progression, assessed by one or more of three measures: the EDSS, Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), and 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). The primary outcome in part 2 was the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01416181.FINDINGS: Between Sept 13, 2011, and July 16, 2015, 889 patients were randomly assigned (n=440 to the natalizumab group, n=449 to the placebo group). In part 1, 195 (44%) of 439 natalizumab-treated patients and 214 (48%) of 448 placebo-treated patients had confirmed disability progression (odds ratio [OR] 0·86; 95% CI 0·66-1·13; p=0·287). No treatment effect was observed on the EDSS (OR 1·06, 95% CI 0·74-1·53; nominal p=0·753) or the T25FW (0·98, 0·74-1·30; nominal p=0·914) components of the primary outcome. However, natalizumab treatment reduced 9HPT progression (OR 0·56, 95% CI 0·40-0·80; nominal p=0·001). In part 1, 100 (22%) placebo-treated and 90 (20%) natalizumab-treated patients had serious adverse events. In part 2, 291 natalizumab-continuing patients and 274 natalizumab-naive patients received natalizumab (median follow-up 160 weeks [range 108-221]). Serious adverse events occurred in 39 (13%) patients continuing natalizumab and in 24 (9%) patients initiating natalizumab. Two deaths occurred in part 1, neither of which was considered related to study treatment.

In patients with relapsing forms of MS, natalizumab therapy is known to significantly reduce intrathecal inflammatory responses which results in reductions in brain lesions and brain atrophy as well as beneficial effects on clinical measures, such as reduced frequency and severity of relapse and reduced accumulation of disability. Natalizumab treatment also reduces levels of cerebrospinal fluid chemokines and other biomarkers of intrathecal inflammation, axonal damage and demyelination, and has demonstrated the ability to reduce innate immune activation and intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis in patients with MS. The efficacy of natalizumab therapy in SPMS is currently being investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In contrast, the upstream nucleosome which covers the TATA box under repressed conditions is shifted approximately 50 bp further upstream by the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler RSC upon activation.

Hog1 targets the RSC chromatin remodeling complex to stress-responsive genes and rsc deficient cells display reduced induction of gene expression. Here we show that the absence of H3K4 methylation, either achieved by deletion of the SET1 methyltransferase or by amino acid substitution of H3K4, bypasses the requirement of RSC for stress-responsive gene expression. Monomethylation of H3K4 is specifically inhibiting RSC-independent chromatin remodeling and thus, it prevents osmostress-induced gene expression. The absence of H3K4 monomethylation permits that the association of alternative remodelers with stress-responsive genes and the Swr1 complex (SWR-C) is instrumental in the induction of gene expression upon stress. Accordingly, the absence of SWR-C or histone H2A.Z results in compromised chromatin remodeling and impaired gene expression in the absence of RSC and H3K4 methylation. These results indicate that expression of stress-responsive genes is controlled by two remodeling mechanisms: RSC in the presence of monomethylated H3K4, and SWR-C in the absence of H3K4 monomethylation.

Solid-state coating morphology of PTH(1-34) on microprojection arrays was determined by SEM, and stability on storage was assessed after dissolution and testing with stability indicating assays. Internal vapor analysis was performed to detect and quantify volatile organics released by patch components into the headspace inside the final package.RESULTS: Aggregation and oxidation were the primary degradation mechanisms for solid-state PTH(1-34) in this transdermal delivery system. Although these two degradation pathways can be retarded by appropriate stabilizers and use of foil pouch packaging (nitrogen purged and desiccant), the solid-state drug formulation's compatibility with patch components, particularly the plastic retainer ring, surprisingly dictated PTH(1-34) stability. Internal vapor analysis demonstrated that PTH(1-34) was particularly vulnerable to vapors such as moisture, oxygen, and outgassed formaldehyde, and each of these volatiles played a unique and significant role in PTH(1-34)'s degradation mechanism.CONCLUSIONS: Identifying degradation mechanisms of volatile compounds on solid-state PTH(1-34) peptide stability allowed for the rationale for selection of final formulation, system components and packaging conditions.

Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), one of the primary cardiovascular regulatory systems, has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disease. In particular, the RAS has been implicated as advances in the understanding of the multifunctionality of individual components of the system have been made, and by the fact that the RAS acts not only systemically, but also locally in a variety of tissues, including the lung. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a relatively new member of the RAS, has drawn extensive attention since 2003, because of the findings that ACE2 is the receptor for SARS Corona virus and that maintenance of normal ACE2 levels in the lung is beneficial for the host to combat inflammatory lung disease. Nevertheless, the mechanism through which ACE2 plays a role in inflammatory lung disease has not been clearly identified. In an attempt to summarize current literature findings and progress made in uncovering the role of ACE2 in inflammatory lung disease, this review will focus on recent studies examining pulmonary ACE2 biology, its roles in inflammatory lung disease pathogenesis and possible underlying mechanisms.

Hence, the role of the RBM is a bi-functional bioactive surface that can be demonstrated by antibodies such as the neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody (mAb) 80R which targets the RBM and competes with the ACE2 receptor for binding. Here, we employ phage-display peptide-libraries to reconstitute a functional RBM. This is achieved by generating a vast collection of candidate RBM peptides that present a diversity of conformations.

Consequently, misassembled viral complexes are redirected into the endocytic pathway where they are delivered to lysosomes for degradation. In this study, we demonstrate that autophagy is a critical mediator of the viral degradation pathway and that this pathway is not HIV-1 specific. Misassembled viral complexes were found to colocalize extensively with LC3 and p62 in late endosomes/lysosomes, demonstrating a convergence of autophagy with functional degradative compartments. Knocking down autophagosome formation machineries reduced this convergence, while treatment with autophagy-inducer rapamycin enhanced the convergence. Furthermore, similar autophagy-dependent nonspecific miRNA inhibition of murine leukemia virus (MLV) assembly was shown. Overall, these results reveal autophagy as a crucial regulator of the retroviral degradation pathway in host cells initiated by nonspecific miRNA-Gag interactions. These findings could have significant implications for understanding how cells may regulate retroviral complex assembly by miRNA expression and autophagy, and raise the possibility that similar regulations can occur in other biological contexts."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Autophagy is important in cellular homeostasis for the cell survival mechanism.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Autophagy is the process where a virus obtains nutrients from it's host, yes or no?", "id": "5e3d8edf48dab47f26000003_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Autophagy is important in cellular homeostasis for the cell survival mechanism.

Chromosomal imbalances have been reported in several patients presenting with gonadal dysgenesis as part of severe dysmorphic phenotypes.RESULTS: We screened for submicroscopic DNA copy number variations in two sisters with an apparent normal 46,XY karyotype and female external genitalia due to gonadal dysgenesis, and in which mutations in known candidate genes had been excluded. By high-resolution tiling bacterial artificial chromosome array comparative genome hybridization, a submicroscopic duplication at Xp21.2 containing DAX1 (NR0B1) was identified. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, multiple ligation probe amplification, and PCR, the rearrangement was further characterized. This revealed a 637-kb tandem duplication that in addition to DAX1 includes the four MAGEB genes, the hypothetical gene CXorf21, GK, and part of the MAP3K7IP3 gene. Sequencing and analysis of the breakpoint boundaries and duplication junction suggest that the duplication originated through a coupled homologous and nonhomologous recombination process.CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first duplication on Xp21.2 identified in patients with isolated gonadal dysgenesis because all previously described XY subjects with Xp21 duplications presented with gonadal dysgenesis as part of a more complex phenotype, including mental retardation and/or malformations.

We assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the GRADE approach. We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures. We reported findings narratively and in tables.MAIN RESULTS: We included nine Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions to treat symptoms in people with MND. Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non-RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. Drug therapy for painThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. Treatment for crampsThere is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo:- memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence);- vitamin E may have little or no effect (low-quality evidence); and- the effects of L-threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data.The review reported adverse effects of riluzole, but it is not clear whether other interventions had adverse effects. Treatment for spasticityIt is uncertain whether an endurance-based exercise programme improved spasticity or quality of life, measured at three months after the programme, as the quality of evidence is very low (1 RCT, comparison \"usual activities\", N = 25). The review did not evaluate other approaches, such as use of baclofen as no RCTs were available. Mechanical ventilation for supporting respiratory functionNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves median survival and quality of life in people with respiratory insufficiency and normal to moderately impaired bulbar function compared to standard care, and improves quality of life but not survival for people with poor bulbar function (1 RCT, N = 41, moderate-quality evidence; a second RCT did not provide data). The review did not evaluate other approaches such as tracheostomy-assisted ('invasive') ventilation, or assess timing of NIV initiation. Treatment for sialorrhoeaA single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands probably improves sialorrhoea and quality of life at up to 4 weeks compared to placebo injections, but not at 8 or 12 weeks after the injections (moderate-quality evidence from 1 placebo-controlled RCT, N = 20). The review authors found no trials of other approaches. Enteral tube feeding for supporting nutritionThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to support benefit or harms of enteral tube feeding in supporting nutrition in MND. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulationIt is uncertain whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves disability or limitation in activity in MND in comparison with sham rTMS (3 RCTs, very low quality evidence, N = 50). Therapeutic exerciseThere is evidence that exercise may improve disability in MND at three months after the exercise programme, but not quality of life, in comparison with \"usual activities\" or \"usual care\" including stretching (2 RCTs, low-quality evidence, N = 43). Multidisciplinary careThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to demonstrate any benefit or harm for multidisciplinary care in MND.None of the reviews, other than the review of treatment for cramps, reported that adverse events occurred. However, the trials were too small for reliable adverse event reporting.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview has highlighted the lack of robust evidence in Cochrane Systematic Reviews on interventions to manage symptoms resulting from MND. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention for reasons other than a true lack of efficacy, for example because of insufficient statistical power, the wrong choice of dose, insensitive outcome measures or inappropriate participant eligibility. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse effects of the treatments. The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a placebo-controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo-controlled RCTs in these areas.We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs-of people with MND and their caregivers-associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality of life)."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L-threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine.

Thus, specific inhibitors of these proteases block virus infection. However, it is unclear which of these pathways is actually utilized by HCoV-229E in the human respiratory tract. Here, we examined the mechanism of cell entry used by a pseudotyped virus bearing the HCoV-229E spike (S) protein in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. We found that, compared with a laboratory strain isolated in 1966 and passaged for a half century, clinical isolates of HCoV-229E were less likely to utilize cathepsin L; rather, they showed a preference for TMPRSS2. Two amino acid substitutions (R642M and N714K) in the S protein of HCoV-229E clinical isolates altered their sensitivity to a cathepsin L inhibitor, suggesting that these amino acids were responsible for cathepsin L use. After 20 passages in HeLa cells, the ability of the isolate to use cathepsin increased so that it was equal to that of the laboratory strain; this increase was caused by an amino acid substitution (I577S) in the S protein. The passaged virus showed a reduced ability to replicate in differentiated airway epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface. These results suggest that the endosomal pathway is disadvantageous for HCoV-229E infection of human airway epithelial cells; therefore, clinical isolates are less able to use cathepsin.IMPORTANCE: Many enveloped viruses enter cells through endocytosis. Viral spike proteins drive the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes to facilitate insertion of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) utilizes endosomal cathepsin L to activate the spike protein after receptor binding. Here, we found that clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferentially utilize the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin L. The endosome is a main site of Toll-like receptor recognition, which then triggers an innate immune response; therefore, HCoV-229E presumably evolved to bypass the endosome by entering the cell via TMPRSS2. Thus, the virus uses a simple mechanism to evade the host innate immune system. Therefore, therapeutic agents for coronavirus-mediated diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), should target cell surface TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Microbiology."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting investigations revealed the presence of cathepsin L in the nuclear compartment in addition to its expected endo-lysosomal localization in colorectal carcinoma cells.", "answer_start": 363}], "question": "Is cathepsin L active in endosomes?", "id": "5e8101e3835f4e477700002e_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Prominent tasks of cysteine cathepsins involve endo-lysosomal proteolysis and turnover of extracellular matrix constituents or plasma membrane proteins for maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.

Cathepsin L was represented as the full-length protein in the nuclei of HCT116 cells from which stefin B, a potent cathepsin L inhibitor, was absent. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analyses with synchronized cell cultures revealed deceleration of cell cycle progression of HCT116 cells upon inhibition of cathepsin L activity, while expression of cathepsin L-enhanced green fluorescent protein chimeras accelerated S-phase entry. We conclude that the activity of cathepsin L is high in the nucleus of colorectal carcinoma cells because of lacking stefin B inhibitory activity.

We examined the intracellular distribution of Hendra virus F following endocytosis and showed that it is primarily present in Rab5- and Rab4-positive endosomal compartments, suggesting that cathepsin L cleavage occurs in early endosomes. Hendra virus F transmembrane domain (TMD) residues S490 and Y498 were found to be important for correct Hendra virus F recycling, with the hydroxyl group of S490 and the aromatic ring of Y498 important for this process.

Several trials are planned or are in progress to assess whether minocycline slows human neurodegeneration. We aimed to test the efficacy of minocycline as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled phase III trial. After a 4-month lead-in phase, 412 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or minocycline in escalating doses of up to 400 mg/day for 9 months. The primary outcome measure was the difference in rate of change in the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R). Secondary outcome measures were forced vital capacity (FVC), manual muscle testing (MMT), quality of life, survival, and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat.

As on previous occasions, the results obtained in the laboratory are not reproduced in clinical practice. The reasons for this new disappointment in translational medicine are analysed by applying the successes obtained in the experimental animal model for ALS to humans. The most frequently suggested causes for explaining these continuous failures are unawareness of the correct dosage to be used, the ideal duration of the clinical trial in phase III, sample size, the search for a primary outcome for measurement other than survival, the need for biomarkers giving information on the progression of the disease and whether this is modified by the introduction of the drug for study. Debate focuses on whether the transgenic mouse model of ALS which expresses SOD1 mutations which we have been using for more than a decade is an exact reflection of the clinical profile and the physiopathogenic mechanisms present in patients with spo- radic ALS. There is the possibility that depending on the dose administered, minocycline can be a neuroprotector or a neurotoxin. In other words, at a dose of 200 mg/day, this drug behaves like <<Dr. Jekyll>> and like <<Mr. Hyde>> at doses of 400 mg. For the authors of the trial, this possibility does not seem to be the cause of the disappointing results obtained. However, they acknowledge that one of the limitations of their study was that it was impossible to compare the effects of minocycline in the patient after receiving 200 or 400 mg. For many other researchers running ongoing clinical trials in both ALS and other neurological diseases, the dose of 200 mg/day is chosen as ideal for testing the effectiveness of minocycline in patients. The strategy of administering the maximum dose of a drug to be tested may give rise to misleading results. We agree with the opinion of other authors, who say that minocycline should be given a second chance."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Despite discontinuation of the first inhalable insulin, Exubera®, due to suboptimal market acceptance, development of orally inhaled insulin delivery systems has been galvanized by the recent approval of Afrezza® and several others awaiting approval.", "answer_start": 196}], "question": "Is the drug Exubera currently (March 2020) available?", "id": "5e776a10835f4e477700000c_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "INTRODUCTION: Delivery of therapeutic insulin via the pulmonary route has been the most investigated non-invasive alternative to the commonly used subcutaneous (SC) route for diabetes management.

Faecal shedding lasted for 28-56 days, but virus shed during this stage was less infectious in enterocyte cultures and affected by mutations. Remarkably, in the other cat neither clinical signs nor acute shedding were seen, but virus was detected in blood cells from 3 dpi, and shedding of non-enterotropic, mutated viruses suddenly occurred from 14 dpi onwards. Neutralising antibodies arose from 21 dpi. Leukocyte numbers were not different compared to the other cats, except for the CD8(+) regulatory T cells. These data indicate that FECV can infect immune cells even in the absence of intestinal replication and raise the hypothesis that the gradual adaptation to these cells can allow non-enterotropic mutants to arise."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "At treatment end, no significant differences were seen for change in MADRS total score with TC-5214 versus placebo.

It is hypothesized that antibody capture of nicotine in the bloodstream would prevent it from crossing the blood-brain barrier and reaching the nicotinic receptors. The advantage of the approach includes the relatively gradual rise of antibody levels, which may reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and the possible persistence of the antibodies potentially provides long-term protection, possibly preventing relapse.

To identify any other material including reviews and papers potentially relevant to the background or discussion sections, we also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, combining terms for nicotine vaccines with terms for smoking and tobacco use, without design limits or limits for human subjects. We searched the Annual Meeting abstracts of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco up to 2012, using the search string 'vaccin'. We searched Google Scholar for 'nicotine vaccine'. We also searched company websites and Google for information related to specific vaccines. We searched clinicaltrials.gov in March 2012 for 'nicotine vaccine' and for the trade names of known vaccine candidates.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials of nicotine vaccines, at Phase II and Phase III trial stage and beyond, in adult smokers or recent ex-smokers. We included studies of nicotine vaccines used as part of smoking cessation or relapse prevention interventions.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data on the type of participants, the dose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, blinding of participants and personnel, reporting of outcomes, and completeness of follow-up.Our primary outcome measure was a minimum of six months abstinence from smoking. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred cessation rates at 12 months and biochemically validated rates where available. We have used the risk ratio (RR) to summarize individual trial outcomes. We have not pooled the current group of included studies as they cover different vaccines and variable regimens.MAIN RESULTS: There are no nicotine vaccines currently licensed for public use, but there are a number in development. We found four trials which met our inclusion criteria, three comparing NicVAX to placebo and one comparing NIC002 (formerly NicQbeta) to placebo. All were smoking cessation trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies as part of the drug development process, and all trials were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Overall, 2642 smokers participated in the included studies in this review. None of the four included studies detected a statistically significant difference in long-term cessation between participants receiving vaccine and those receiving placebo. The RR for 12 month cessation in active and placebo groups was 1.35 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.82 to 2.22) in the trial of NIC002 and 1.74 (95% CI 0.73 to 4.18) in one NicVAX trial. Two Phase III NicVAX trials, for which full results were not available, reported similar quit rates of approximately 11% in both groups. In the two studies with full results available, post hoc analyses detected higher cessation rates in participants with higher levels of nicotine antibodies, but these findings are not readily generalisable. The two studies with full results showed nicotine vaccines to be well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. In the study of NIC002, participants receiving the vaccine were more likely to report mild to moderate adverse events, most commonly flu-like symptoms, whereas in the study of NicVAX there was no significant difference between the two arms. Information on adverse events was not available for the large Phase III trials of NicVAX.Vaccine candidates are likely to undergo significant changes before becoming available to the general public, and those included in this review may not be the first to reach market; this limits the external validity of the results reported in this review in terms of both effectiveness and tolerability.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no evidence that nicotine vaccines enhance long-term smoking cessation. Rates of serious adverse events recorded in the two trials with full data available were low, and the majority of adverse events reported were at mild to moderate levels. The evidence available suggests nicotine vaccines do not induce compensatory smoking or affect withdrawal symptoms.

To identify any other material including reviews and papers potentially relevant to the background or discussion sections, we also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, combining terms for nicotine vaccines with terms for smoking and tobacco use, without design limits or limits for human subjects. We searched the Annual Meeting abstracts of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco up to 2012, using the search string 'vaccin'. We searched Google Scholar for 'nicotine vaccine'. We also searched company websites and Google for information related to specific vaccines. We searched clinicaltrials.gov in March 2012 for 'nicotine vaccine' and for the trade names of known vaccine candidates.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials of nicotine vaccines, at Phase II and Phase III trial stage and beyond, in adult smokers or recent ex-smokers. We included studies of nicotine vaccines used as part of smoking cessation or relapse prevention interventions.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data on the type of participants, the dose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, blinding of participants and personnel, reporting of outcomes, and completeness of follow-up.Our primary outcome measure was a minimum of six months abstinence from smoking. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred cessation rates at 12 months and biochemically validated rates where available. We have used the risk ratio (RR) to summarize individual trial outcomes. We have not pooled the current group of included studies as they cover different vaccines and variable regimens.MAIN RESULTS: There are no nicotine vaccines currently licensed for public use, but there are a number in development. We found four trials which met our inclusion criteria, three comparing NicVAX to placebo and one comparing NIC002 (formerly NicQbeta) to placebo. All were smoking cessation trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies as part of the drug development process, and all trials were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Overall, 2642 smokers participated in the included studies in this review. None of the four included studies detected a statistically significant difference in long-term cessation between participants receiving vaccine and those receiving placebo. The RR for 12 month cessation in active and placebo groups was 1.35 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.82 to 2.22) in the trial of NIC002 and 1.74 (95% CI 0.73 to 4.18) in one NicVAX trial. Two Phase III NicVAX trials, for which full results were not available, reported similar quit rates of approximately 11% in both groups. In the two studies with full results available, post hoc analyses detected higher cessation rates in participants with higher levels of nicotine antibodies, but these findings are not readily generalisable. The two studies with full results showed nicotine vaccines to be well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. In the study of NIC002, participants receiving the vaccine were more likely to report mild to moderate adverse events, most commonly flu-like symptoms, whereas in the study of NicVAX there was no significant difference between the two arms. Information on adverse events was not available for the large Phase III trials of NicVAX.Vaccine candidates are likely to undergo significant changes before becoming available to the general public, and those included in this review may not be the first to reach market; this limits the external validity of the results reported in this review in terms of both effectiveness and tolerability.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no evidence that nicotine vaccines enhance long-term smoking cessation. Rates of serious adverse events recorded in the two trials with full data available were low, and the majority of adverse events reported were at mild to moderate levels. The evidence available suggests nicotine vaccines do not induce compensatory smoking or affect withdrawal symptoms. No nicotine vaccines are currently licensed for use in any country but a number are under development.Further trials of nicotine vaccines are needed, comparing vaccines with placebo for smoking cessation. Further trials are also needed to explore the potential of nicotine vaccines to prevent relapse. Results from past, current and future research should be reported in full.

Current smoking cessation rates using behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapeutic interventions have had modest success, with ∼1:5 smokers remaining abstinent long-term. Nicotine vaccines are a new class of immunotherapeutics under development. It is believed that anti-nicotine antibodies arising from vaccination capture nicotine and prevent or reduce its entry into the brain, as the antibody-bound nicotine is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier. This in turn decreases the pleasurable effects of smoking, reducing or eliminating positive reinforcement, thereby making it easier for a smoker to quit smoking. Four vaccine candidates have advanced into clinical testing with mixed success. Proof-of-concept has been established in that individuals with higher levels of anti-nicotine antibodies were observed to have higher smoking cessation and abstinence rates. Recently, the most advanced candidate vaccine, NicVAX, failed to meet the primary endpoint in two large phase III studies, although the correlation of higher abstinence rates in subjects with higher immunity to nicotine was observed. Although the field has had setbacks, the magnitude of the tobacco epidemic and the positive pre-clinical research and observed clinical trends indicate continued research is warranted. Several avenues are being actively pursued: a) improving vaccine potency by introducing novel carriers and/or adjuvants to stimulate higher immune response b) targeting subjects who have a robust response (e.g. personalized medicine) c) combining vaccines with pharmacotherapy for maintenance of abstinence/relapse prevention.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00318383 NCT00598325 NCT00836199."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "There is a long standing perception that AhR ligands are automatically disqualified from pharmaceutical development due to their induction of Cyp1a1 as well as their potential for causing \"dioxin-like\" toxicities.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "AhR ligands are attractive drug targets for pharmaceutical development due to their induction of Cyp1a1, yes or no?", "id": "5e52c9266d0a27794100004e_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "There is a long standing perception that AhR ligands are automatically disqualified from pharmaceutical development due to their induction of Cyp1a1 as well as their potential for causing \"dioxin-like\" toxicities.

We investigated whether inhibition of the highly homologous insulin receptor (IR) in addition to the IGF1R would be more effective than inhibition of the IGF1R alone at preventing the proliferation of NSCLC cells. Signalling through IGF1R and IR in the NSCLC cell lines A549 and Hcc193 was stimulated by a combination of IGF1, IGF2 and insulin. It was inhibited by antibodies that block ligand binding, αIR3 (IGF1R) and IR47-9 (IR), and by the ATP-competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors AZ12253801 and NVPAWD742 which inhibit both IGF1R and IR tyrosine kinases. The effect of inhibitors was determined by an anchorage-independent proliferation assay and by analysis of Akt phosphorylation. In Hcc193 cells the reduction in cell proliferation and Akt phosphorylation due to anti-IGF1R antibody was enhanced by antibody-mediated inhibition of the IR whereas in A549 cells, with a relatively low IR:IGF1R expression ratio, it was not. In each cell line proliferation and Akt phosphorylation were more effectively inhibited by AZ12253801 and NVPAWD742 than by combined αIR3 and IR47-9. When the IGF1R alone is inhibited, unencumbered signalling through the IR can contribute to continued NSCLC cell proliferation.
