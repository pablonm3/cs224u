The pharmacokinetics of elagolix have been well-characterized in phase I studies; however, elagolix population pharmacokinetics have not been previously reported. Therefore, a robust model was developed to describe elagolix population pharmacokinetics and to evaluate factors affecting elagolix pharmacokinetic parameters.METHODS: The data from nine clinical studies (a total of 1624 women) were included in the analysis: five phase I studies in healthy, premenopausal women and four phase III studies in premenopausal women with endometriosis.RESULTS: Elagolix population pharmacokinetics were best described by a two-compartment model with a lag time in absorption. Of the 15 covariates tested for effect on elagolix apparent clearance (CL/F) and/or volume of distribution only one covariate, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 genotype status, had a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, effect on elagolix CL/F.CONCLUSION: Elagolix pharmacokinetics were not affected by patient demographics and were similar between healthy women and women with endometriosis.

Coprimary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of responders (clinically meaningful pain reduction and stable or decreased rescue analgesic use) based on average monthly dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain scores. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and endometrial and bone mineral density assessments. The power of Elaris EM-III and -IV was based on the comparison to placebo in Elaris EM-I and -II with an expected 25% dropout rate.RESULTS: Between December 28, 2012, and October 31, 2014 (Elaris EM-III), and between May 27, 2014, and January 6, 2016 (Elaris EM-IV), 569 participants were enrolled. After 12 months of treatment, Elaris EM-III responder rates for dysmenorrhea were 52.1% at 150 mg once daily (Elaris EM-IV 550.8%) and 78.2% at 200 mg twice daily (Elaris EMIV 575.9%). Elaris EM-III nonmenstrual pelvic pain responder rates were 67.5% at 150 mg once daily (Elaris EM-IV 566.4%) and 69.1% at 200 mg twice daily (Elaris EM-IV 567.2%).”After 12 months of treatment, Elaris EM-III dyspareunia responder rates were 45.2% at 150 mg once daily (Elaris EM-IV=45.9%) and 60.0% at 200 mg twice daily (Elaris EM-IV=58.1%).

Medical therapy is often the first line of management for women with endometriosis in order to ameliorate symptoms or to prevent post-surgical disease recurrence. Currently, there are several medical options for the management of patients with endometriosis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, being efficacious in relieving primary dysmenorrhea. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and progestins, available for multiple routes of administration, are effective first-line hormonal options. In fact, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that they succeed in improving pain symptoms in the majority of patients, are well tolerated and not expensive. Second-line therapy is represented by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Even if these drugs are efficacious in treating women not responding to COCs or progestins, they are not orally available and have a less favorable tolerability profile (needing an appropriate add-back therapy). The use of danazol is limited by the large availability of other better-tolerated hormonal drugs. Because few data are available on long-term efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors they should be administered only in women with symptoms refractory to other conventional therapies in a clinical research setting.

UV-DDB comprises two subunits, products of the DDB1 and DDB2 genes, respectively. Mutations in the DDB2 gene account for the underlying defect in XP-E. The UV-DDB complex is a component of the newly identified cullin 4A-based ubiquitin E3 ligase, DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2). The E3 ubiquitin ligases recognize specific substrates and mediate their ubiquitination to regulate protein activity or target proteins for degradation by the proteasomal pathway. In this study, we have addressed the role of the UV-DDB-based E3 in NER and sought a physiological substrate. We demonstrate that monoubiquitinated histone H2A in native chromatin coimmunoprecipitates with the endogenous DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2) complex in response to UV irradiation. Further, mutations in DDB2 alter the formation and binding activity of the DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2) ligase, accompanied by impaired monoubiquitination of H2A after UV treatment of XP-E cells, compared with repair-proficient cells. This finding indicates that DDB2, as the substrate receptor of the DDB1-CUL4A-based ligase, specifically targets histone H2A for monoubiquitination in a photolesion-binding-dependent manner. Given that the loss of monoubiquitinated histone H2A at the sites of UV-damaged DNA is associated with decreased global genome repair in XP-E cells, this study suggests that histone modification, mediated by the XPE factor, facilitates the initiation of NER."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The UV-damaged DNA binding protein complex (UV-DDB) is implicated in global genomic nucleotide excision repair (NER) in mammalian cells.","answer_start":0}],"question":"What is detected by the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) complex?","id":"5e46da9c3f5415952900000a_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"The UV-damaged DNA binding protein complex (UV-DDB) is implicated in global genomic nucleotide excision repair (NER) in mammalian cells.

The major form of XP is defective in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and comprises seven complementation groups (A-G). The genes defective in all groups have been identified unambiguously with the exception of group E. The cells of some XP-E patients are deficient in a protein complex (consisting of two subunits: p127/DDBI and p48/DDB2) which binds to UV-damaged DNA (UV-DDB) and is specifically involved in the removal of photoproducts from the non-transcribed regions of the genome. However, other XP-E patients have been reported not to lack UV-damaged DNA binding activity (DDB(+)). Here we describe several genetically unrelated XP-E patients, not previously analyzed in depth, each carrying two mutated alleles for DDB2, causing either a single amino acid change or a protein truncation or internal deletion. These defects result in a severe decrease of detectable p48 protein, abolish interaction with the p127 subunit, and produce a deficiency in UV-DDB binding activity (DDB(-)). The role of p48 in the repair defect of these patients was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. Investigation of four DDB(+) cell strains from patients previously assigned to XP-E, allowed us to reclassify all of them into other groups and to show that they do not share the molecular and biochemical features typical for XP-E. Besides confirming that the true XP-E phenotype is DDB(-), resulting from defects in a single gene, DDB2, our results identify the functional domains of the corresponding p48 protein."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"A recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a human IGF1R inhibiting antibody, in patients with moderate to severe, active TAO, indicates the potential effectiveness and safety of the drug.

In TAO, the orbit can become inflamed and undergo substantial remodeling that is disfiguring and can lead to loss of vision. There are currently no approved medical therapies for TAO, the consequence of its uncertain pathogenic nature. It usually presents as a component of the syndrome known as Graves' disease where loss of immune tolerance to the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) results in the generation of activating antibodies against that protein and hyperthyroidism. The role for TSHR and these antibodies in the development of TAO is considerably less well established. We have reported over the past 2 decades evidence that the insulin-like growth factorI receptor (IGF1R) may also participate in the pathogenesis of TAO. Activating antibodies against IGF1R have been detected in patients with GD. The actions of these antibodies initiate signaling in orbital fibroblasts from patients with the disease. Further, we have identified a functional and physical interaction between TSHR and IGF1R. Importantly, it appears that signaling initiated from either receptor can be attenuated by inhibiting the activity of IGF1R. These findings underpin the rationale for therapeutically targeting IGF1R in active TAO. A recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a human IGF1R inhibiting antibody, in patients with moderate to severe, active TAO, indicates the potential effectiveness and safety of the drug.

Discussions of its pathogenesis are generally focused on the thyrotropin receptor, the proposed role for which is supported by substantial evidence. Considerations of any involvement of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) in the disease are frequently contentious. In this brief, topically focused review, I have attempted to provide a balanced perspective based entirely on experimental results that either favor or refute involvement of IGF-IR in TAO. Discussion in this matter seems particularly timely since the currently available treatments of this disfiguring and potentially sight-threatening disease remain inadequate. Importantly, no medical therapy has thus far received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Results from a very recently published clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of teprotumumab, an inhibitory human anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibody, in active, moderate to severe TAO are extremely encouraging. That double-masked, placebo-controlled study involved 88 patients and revealed unprecedented clinical responses in the improvement of proptosis and clinical activity as well as a favorable safety profile.

Real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, reporter gene assays, cell transfections, mRNA stability assays, ELISA, and flow cytometry were performed.Results: We found that bTSH induces TNF-α dramatically in fibrocytes but is undetectable in GD-OF.

Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses are more effective and better tolerated than oral prednisone in the treatment of active, moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Rituximab has also been suggested as a possible replacement for intravenous corticosteroids. Two randomised controlled trials of rituximab reached seemingly contradictory conclusions-rituximab was not better with respect to the primary outcome (clinical activity score) than placebo in one trial (which, however, was confounded by rather long Graves' ophthalmopathy duration), but was slightly better than intravenous methylprednisolone pulses in the other (disease flare-ups occurred only in the latter group). On the basis of evidence published so far, rituximab cannot replace intravenous methylprednisolone pulses, but could have a role in corticosteroid-resistant cases.

A total of 88 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or active drug administered intravenously once every 3 weeks for a total of eight infusions. The primary end point was the response in the study eye. This response was defined as a reduction of 2 points or more in the Clinical Activity Score (scores range from 0 to 7, with a score of ≥3 indicating active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy) and a reduction of 2 mm or more in proptosis at week 24. Secondary end points, measured as continuous variables, included proptosis, the Clinical Activity Score, and results on the Graves' ophthalmopathy-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. Adverse events were assessed.RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat population, 29 of 42 patients who received teprotumumab (69%), as compared with 9 of 45 patients who received placebo (20%), had a response at week 24 (P<0.001). Therapeutic effects were rapid; at week 6, a total of 18 of 42 patients in the teprotumumab group (43%) and 2 of 45 patients in the placebo group (4%) had a response (P<0.001).

The combination of LB100 and radiation also induced accumulation at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, the stage most sensitive to radiation-induced damage. LB100 enhanced radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Animals implanted with chordoma cells and treated with the combination of LB100 and radiation demonstrated tumor growth delay.Conclusions: Combining LB100 and radiation enhanced DNA damage-induced cell death and delayed tumor growth in an animal model of chordoma.

Many classes of DNA lesions induced by chemical agents are eliminated via DNA repair mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER), for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Individuals with NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), in which bulky DNA lesions are not efficiently removed, are cancer-prone and suffer neurodegeneration. For research into cancer and neurological diseases, therefore, it might be important to identify DNA damage from agents that induce NER-repairable bulky DNA lesions. However, simple and quick assays to detect such damaging agents have not been developed using human cells. Here, we report a simple, non-isotopic assay for determining DNA damaging agents that induce NER-repairable DNA lesions by visualizing gene expression from treated fluorescent protein vectors in a mammalian cell system. This assay is based on a comparison of fluorescent protein expression in NER-proficient and NER-deficient cells. When we tested UV-irradiated fluorescent protein vectors, the fluorescent protein was observed in NER-proficient cells, but not in NER-deficient cells. Similar results were obtained for vectors treated with the anticancer drug, cisplatin. In contrast, when treated with the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, believed to cause BER-repairable damage, no difference in gene expression between NER-proficient and NER-deficient cells was observed. These results suggest that our assay can specifically detect DNA-damaging agents that induce NER-repairable DNA lesions, and could be used to analyze chemicals with the potential to cause cancer and neurological diseases. With further validation, the assay might be also applicable to XP diagnosis."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"mutations in the ERCC1 or ERCC4 genes cause a remarkable array of rare inherited human disorders.

ERCC1-XPF is a core component of nucleotide excision repair and also plays a role in interstrand crosslink repair, some pathways of double-strand break repair by homologous recombination and end-joining, as a backup enzyme in base excision repair, and in telomere length regulation. In many of these activities, ERCC1-XPF complex cleaves the 3' tails of DNA intermediates in preparation for further processing. ERCC1-XPF interacts with other proteins including XPA, RPA, SLX4 and TRF2 to perform its functions. Disruption of these interactions or direct targeting of ERCC1-XPF to decrease its DNA repair function might be a useful strategy to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to some DNA damaging agents.

The most energetic part of the solar spectrum at the Earth's surface (UVB, 280-320 nm) leads to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (64PPs). Less energetic but 20-times more intense UVA (320-400 nm) also induces the formation of CPDs together with a wide variety of oxidatively generated lesions such as single strand breaks and oxidized bases. Among those, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua) is the most frequent since it can be produced by several mechanisms. Data available on the respective yield of DNA photoproducts in cells and skin show that exposure to sunlight mostly induces pyrimidine dimers, which explains the mutational signature found in skin tumors, with lower amounts of 8-oxoGua and strand breaks. The present review aims at describing the basic photochemistry of DNA and discussing the quantitative formation of the different UV-induced DNA lesions reported in the literature. Additional information on mutagenesis, repair and photoprotection is briefly provided."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"UV-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) lesions such as a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and a (6-4) photoproduct ((6-4)pp),","answer_start":267}],"question":"List types of DNA lesions caused by UV light.","id":"5e46e8c13f5415952900000c_003","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Photolyases (PHRs) and cryptochromes (CRYs) belong to the same family known as blue-light photoreceptors. Although their amino acid sequences and corresponding structures are similar to each other, they exert different functions. PHRs function as an enzyme to repair UV-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) lesions such as a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and a (6-4) photoproduct ((6-4)pp), whereas CRYs are a circadian photoreceptor in plants and animals and at the same time they control the photoperiodic induction of flowering in plants. When a new type cryptochrome was identified, it was assumed that another type of CRYs, cryptochrome-DASH (CRY-DASH), which is categorized as a subfamily of photolyase/cryptochrome family, would possess the DNA photolyase activity. However, CRY-DASH had a weak DNA photolyase activity, but the reason for this is still unclear. To clarify the reason, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a complex of CPD-PHR or CRY-DASH with damaged double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and estimated the binding free energy, ΔGbind, between the protein and the damaged dsDNA by using a molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) method. ΔGbind for both proteins were -35 and 57 kcal mol-1, respectively, indicating that the structural stability of CRY-DASH was lower than that of CPD-PHR upon the damaged dsDNA binding. In particular, the number of amino acid residues relevant to the damaged dsDNA binding on the CRY-DASH surface was smaller than that on CPD-PHR. Therefore, the present result suggests that CRY-DASH has a weak DNA photolyase activity because it has a lower binding affinity than CPD-PHR."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"DNA lesions such as those generated by UV light: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PPs)","answer_start":285}],"question":"List types of DNA lesions caused by UV light.","id":"5e46e8c13f5415952900000c_004","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and Cockayne syndrome (CS) are rare genetic diseases characterized by a large range of clinical symptoms.

The mechanism of the action of the novel drugs is incompletely understood, but it seems to be based on the inactivation of soluble proteins of the transforming growth factor-ß (TGFß) family. This review considers pros and cons of the clinical use of the drugs in reference to the current therapy with recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).RECENT FINDINGS: One or more activin type-II receptor (ActRII) ligands appear to inhibit erythroid precursors, for example growth and differentiation factor 11. Trapping of these ligands by the recombinant ActRII fusion proteins, sotatercept and luspatercept increases red blood cell numbers and hemoglobin levels in humans. Reportedly, the novel compounds were well tolerated in trials on healthy volunteers and patients suffering from anemia due to chronic kidney disease or malignancies. On approval, the drugs may prove particularly useful in patients suffering from ineffective erythropoiesis, such as in myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma or ß-thalassemia, where ESAs are of little use. Independent of their effect on erythropoiesis, ActRII ligand traps were found to exert beneficial effects on renal tissue in experimental animals.SUMMARY: ESAs are likely to remain standard of care in renal anemia. There is a need for a better understanding of the effects of ActRII ligand traps on TGFß-like proteins. The novel drugs have not been approved for sale as therapeutics so far.

However, this puts lifelong demands not only on the patients but also on the health care systems that are tasked with delivering long-term treatment and comprehensive support. Prevention programs and curative approaches are therefore an important part of overall strategy. Curative treatments alter the dynamic of a patient's health care costs, from financial commitment over 50 years, into a potential \"one-off\" investment. Since the 1980s, this has usually been available only to the 30% or so of young children with matched sibling donors. By improving the safety of matched related donors and haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplants, the potential size of the donor pool for curative therapies may be increased. Recent advances in gene therapy demonstrate that even patients lacking a matched donor can be rendered transfusion independent with an autograft of genetically modified autologous stem cells, with a low short-term risk. Noncurative treatments are also of potential value by decreasing use of blood and chelators and decreasing hospital visits. An example is luspatercept, an activin-receptor trap that modifies transforming growth factor-β signaling, thereby increasing the efficiency of erythropoiesis. This has entered phase 3 clinical trials for TDT and non-TDT and, usefully increases in both Hb and quality of life in non-TDT as well as decreasing transfusion requirements in TDT.

Luspatercept (ACE-536) is a novel fusion protein that blocks transforming growth factor beta (TGF β) superfamily inhibitors of erythropoiesis, giving rise to a promising new investigative therapy. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of luspatercept in patients with anaemia due to lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.METHODS: In this phase 2, multicentre, open-label, dose-finding study (PACE-MDS), with long-term extension, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had International Prognostic Scoring System-defined low or intermediate 1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes or non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (white blood cell count <13 000/μL), and had anaemia with or without red blood cell transfusion support. Enrolled patients were classified as having low transfusion burden, defined as requiring less than 4 red blood cell units in the 8 weeks before treatment (and baseline haemoglobin <10 g/dL), or high transfusion burden, defined as requiring 4 or more red blood cell units in the 8 weeks before treatment. Patients received luspatercept subcutaneously once every 21 days at dose concentrations ranging from 0·125 mg/kg to 1·75 mg/kg bodyweight for five doses (over a maximum of 12 weeks). Patients in the expansion cohort were treated with 1·0 mg/kg luspatercept; dose titration up to 1·75 mg/kg was allowed, and patients could be treated with luspatercept for a maximum of 5 years. Patients in the base study were assessed for response and safety after 12 weeks in order to be considered for enrolment into the extension study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving modified International Working Group-defined haematological improvement-erythroid (HI-E), defined as a haemoglobin concentration increase of 1·5 g/dL or higher from baseline for 14 days or longer in low transfusion burden patients, and a reduction in red blood cell transfusion of 4 or more red blood cell units or a 50% or higher reduction in red blood cell units over 8 weeks versus pre-treatment transfusion burden in high transfusion burden patients. Patient data were subcategorised by: luspatercept dose concentrations (0·125-0·5 mg/kg vs 0·75-1·75 mg/kg); pre-study transfusion burden (high transfusion burden vs low transfusion burden, defined as ≥4 vs <4 red blood cell units per 8 weeks); pre-study serum erythropoietin concentration (<200 IU/L, 200-500 IU/L, and >500 IU/L); presence of 15% or more ring sideroblasts; and presence of SF3B1 mutations. Efficacy analyses were carried out on the efficacy evaluable and intention-to-treat populations. This trial is currently ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01749514 and NCT02268383.FINDINGS: Between Jan 21, 2013, and Feb 12, 2015, 58 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were enrolled in the 12 week base study at nine treatment centres in Germany; 27 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation cohorts (0·125-1·75 mg/kg) and 31 patients in the expansion cohort (1·0-1·75 mg/kg). 32 (63% [95% CI 48-76]) of 51 patients receiving higher dose luspatercept concentrations (0·75-1·75 mg/kg) achieved HI-E versus two (22% [95% CI 3-60]) of nine receiving lower dose concentrations (0·125-0·5 mg/kg). Three treatment-related grade 3 adverse events occurred in one patient each: myalgia (one [2%]), increased blast cell count (one [2%]), and general physical health deterioration (one [2%]). Two of these treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were reversible serious grade 3 adverse events: one patient (2%) had myalgia and one patient (2%) had general physical health deterioration.INTERPRETATION: Luspatercept was well tolerated and effective for the treatment of anaemia in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and so could therefore provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of anaemia associated with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes; further studies are ongoing.FUNDING: Acceleron Pharma.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have shown that LB100, a small-molecule inhibitor of PP2A, sensitizes cancer cells to radiation-mediated DNA damage. We hypothesized that LB100 could sensitize ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. We performed in vitro studies in SKOV-3, OVCAR-8, and PEO1, -4, and -6 ovarian cancer lines to assess cytotoxicity potentiation, cell-death mechanism(s), cell-cycle regulation, and DDR signaling. In vivo studies were conducted in an intraperitoneal metastatic mouse model using SKOV-3/f-Luc cells. LB100 sensitized ovarian carcinoma lines to cisplatin-mediated cell death. Sensitization via LB100 was mediated by abrogation of cell-cycle arrest induced by cisplatin. Loss of the cisplatin-induced checkpoint correlated with decreased Wee1 expression, increased cdc2 activation, and increased mitotic entry (p-histone H3). LB100 also induced constitutive hyperphosphorylation of DDR proteins (BRCA1, Chk2, and γH2AX), altered the chronology and persistence of JNK activation, and modulated the expression of 14-3-3 binding sites.

Several new studies added important insights on apoC-III and its physiological function confirming its promise as a valid therapeutic target.RECENT FINDINGS: APOC3 is expressed in liver and intestine and regulates triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) catabolism and anabolism. The transcriptional regulation in both organs requires different regulatory elements. Clinical and preclinical studies established that apoC-III raises plasma triglyceride levels predominantly by inhibiting hepatic TRL clearance. Mechanistic insights into missense variants indicate accelerated renal clearance of apoC-III variants resulting in enhanced TRL catabolism. In contrast, an APOC3 gain-of-function variant enhances de novo lipogenesis and hepatic TRL production. Multiple studies confirmed the correlation between increased apoC-III levels and cardiovascular disease. This has opened up new therapeutic avenues allowing targeting of specific apoC-III properties in triglyceride metabolism.SUMMARY: Novel in vivo models and APOC3 missense variants revealed unique mechanisms by which apoC-III inhibits TRL catabolism.

Controversies regarding hypertriglyceridaemia as an independent risk factor for CVD have occurred partly because elevated triglyceride levels are often a component of atherogenic dyslipidaemia - they are associated with decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and increased levels of small dense LDL particles, which are highly atherogenic. Findings from several large studies indicate that elevated levels of triglycerides (either fasting or nonfasting) or, more specifically, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, are independently associated with increased risk of CVD. Possible mechanisms for this association include excessive free fatty acid release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors, and impairment of fibrinolysis. Therapeutic targeting of hypertriglyceridaemia could, therefore, reduce CVD and cardiovascular events, beyond the reduction achieved by LDL-cholesterol lowering. Elevated triglyceride levels are reduced with lifestyle interventions and fibrates, which can be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. Some new drugs are on the horizon, such as volanesorsen (which targets apolipoprotein C-III), pemafibrate, and others.

Incidences of adverse events (AEs) were reported for the entire study period.RESULTS: The modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population comprised 998 patients. At baseline, 940 (94.2%) were female, mean (SD) age was 38.7 (11.49) years, and disease duration was 6.7 (6.24) years. The mean (SD) SELENA-SLEDAI and SDI scores were 8.2 (4.18) and 0.7 (1.19), respectively; 411 (41.2%) patients had organ damage (SDI = 1: 235 (23.5%); SDI ≥ 2: 176 (17.6%)) prior to belimumab. A total of 427 (42.8%) patients withdrew overall; the most common reasons were patient request (16.8%) and AEs (8.5%).The mean (SD) change in SDI was +0.2 (0.48) at study years 5-6 (n = 403); 343 (85.1%) patients had no change from baseline in SDI score (SDI +1: 46 (11.4%), SDI +2: 13 (3.2%), SDI +3: 1 (0.2%)). Of patients without organ damage at baseline, 211/241 (87.6%) had no change in SDI and the mean change (SD) in SDI was +0.2 (0.44). Of patients with organ damage at baseline, 132/162 (81.5%) had no change in SDI and the mean (SD) change in SDI was +0.2 (0.53). The probability of not having a worsening in SDI score was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.91) and 0.75 (0.67, 0.81) in those without and with baseline damage, respectively (post hoc analysis).Drug-related AEs were reported for 433 (43.4%) patients; infections/infestations (282, 28.3%) and gastrointestinal disorders (139, 13.9%) were the most common.CONCLUSION: Patients with SLE treated with long-term belimumab plus SoC had a low incidence of organ damage accrual and no unexpected AEs. High-risk patients with pre-existing organ damage also had low accrual, suggesting a favorable effect on future damage development.© The Author(s) 2016."}]},{"title":"summary","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"We show that nuclear depletion of the abundant HMGB2 protein occurs early on the path to senescence and coincides with the dramatic spatial clustering of CTCF.

NUCKS1 expression in UC tended to decrease with increasing grades of dysplasia, whereas γH2AX, hTERT, and TP53 expression tended to increase with increasing grades of dysplasia.

It is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In particular, PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is activated upon sensing nicked DNA. Once activated, PARP1 is responsible for the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage response mechanisms. This observation provided the rationale for developing PARP1 inhibitors for the treatment of human malignancies. Indeed, three PARP1 inhibitors (Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib) have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Moreover, in 2017, both Olaparib and Niraparib have also been approved for the treatment of fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Despite this very exciting progress in the clinic, the basic signaling mechanism that connects PARP1 to a diverse array of biological processes is still poorly understood. This is, in large part, due to the inherent technical difficulty associated with the analysis of protein PARylation, which is a low-abundance, labile, and heterogeneous PTM. The study of PARylation has been greatly facilitated by the recent advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies tailored to the analysis of this modification.

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has emerged as a principal alternative to microresection for small- and medium-sized CSHs. Resection is a reasonable option for large (3-4 cm in diameter) and giant (> 4 cm in diameter) CSHs. However, management of giant CSHs remains a challenge for neurosurgeons because of the high rates of morbidity and even death that stem from uncontrollable and massive hemorrhage during surgery. The authors report here the results of their study on the use of hypofractionated SRS (H-SRS) to treat giant CSH. METHODS Between January 2008 and April 2014, 31 patients with a giant CSH (tumor volume > 40 cm3, > 4 cm in diameter) treated using CyberKnife radiosurgery were enrolled in a cohort study. Clinical status and targeted reduction of tumor volume were evaluated by means of serial MRI. The diagnosis for 27 patients was determined on the basis of typical imaging features. In 4 patients, the diagnosis of CSH was confirmed histopathologically. The median CSH volume was 64.4 cm3 (range 40.9-145.3 cm3). Three or 4 sessions of CyberKnife radiosurgery were used with a prescription dose based on the intent to cover the entire tumor with a higher dose while ensuring dose limitation to the visual pathways and brainstem. The median marginal dose to the tumor was 21 Gy (range 19.5-21 Gy) in 3 fractions for 11 patients and 22 Gy (range 18-22 Gy) in 4 fractions for 20 patients. RESULTS The median duration of follow-up was 30 months (range 6-78 months) for all patients. Follow-up MRI scans revealed a median tumor volume reduction of 88.1% (62.3%-99.4%) at last examination compared with the pretreatment volume. Ten patients developed new or aggravated temporary headache and 5 experienced vomiting during the treatment; these acute symptoms were relieved completely after steroid administration. Among the 30 patients with symptoms observed before treatment, 19 achieved complete symptomatic remission, and 11 had partial remission. One patient reported seizures, which were controlled after antiepileptic drug administration. No radiation-induced neurological deficits or delayed complications were reported during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Hypofractionated SRS was an effective and safe modality for treating giant CSH. Considering the risks involved with microsurgery, it is possible that H-SRS might be able to serve as a definitive primary treatment option for giant CSH."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"CyberKnife® is a robotic stereotactic radiotherapy system.

Published evaluation tools, however, allow testing for predefined hypotheses only. Here, we present a novel method for annotation-independent exploration of epigenetic data and their inter-correlation with other genome-wide features. Our method is based on a combinatorial genome segmentation solely using information on combinations of epigenetic marks. It does not require prior knowledge about the data (e.g. gene positions), but allows integrating the data in a straightforward manner. Thereby, it combines compression, clustering and visualization of the data in a single tool. Our method provides intuitive maps of epigenetic patterns across multiple levels of organization, e.g. of the co-occurrence of different epigenetic marks in different cell types. Thus, it facilitates the formulation of new hypotheses on the principles of epigenetic regulation. We apply our method to histone modification data on trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, 9 and 27 in multi-potent and lineage-primed mouse cells, analyzing their combinatorial modification pattern as well as differentiation-related changes of single modifications. We demonstrate that our method is capable of reproducing recent findings of gene centered approaches, e.g. correlations between CpG-density and the analyzed histone modifications. Moreover, combining the clustered epigenetic data with information on the expression status of associated genes we classify differences in epigenetic status of e.g. house-keeping genes versus differentiation-related genes. Visualizing the distribution of modification states on the chromosomes, we discover strong patterns for chromosome X. For example, exclusively H3K9me3 marked segments are enriched, while poised and active states are rare. Hence, our method also provides new insights into chromosome-specific epigenetic patterns, opening up new questions how \"epigenetic computation\" is distributed over the genome in space and time."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a methodology for genome-wide quantitative mapping of mRNA 5' ends to precisely capture transcription start sites at a single nucleotide resolution.

The patient was diagnosed with an incarcerated right inguinal hernia and underwent emergent surgical repair. Intraoperatively a reactive fluid was found within the hernia sac that prompted an exploratory laparotomy for suspected bowel perforation. The hernia was then found to contain an inflamed gangrenous appendix with an inflamed and perforated cecum. An ileocecectomy and enteroenterostomy was performed and the hernia defect was repaired without mesh.DISCUSSION: With an estimated incidence of only 1%, Amyand's hernias are rare and lack a clear evidence-based management scheme. Moreover, they can contain a diverse range of pathologic features and presentations that can complicate diagnosis and treatment. To avoid potential morbidity and mortality, the surgeon must consider an Amyand's hernia on his or her differential when operating on inguinal hernias and be aware of the associated presentations, complications, and management schemes.CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of reports describing simultaneous appendicitis and cecal perforation within an Amyand's hernia.

Currently, little is known about the link between inflammatory stimulation and the pre-mRNA splicing process, although gene expression is changed in inflamed tissues. The present study was designed to investigate whether stimulation of human colonic epithelial cells (HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines) with NH2Cl affects nuclear speckles and their components. By indirect immunofluorescence, nuclear speckles have been shown to undergo rapid aggregation after NH2Cl stimulation. By utilizing Western blotting, SRp30 (a subset of SR proteins) in intestinal epithelial cells was found to be phosphorylated after NH2Cl treatment, whereas other SR proteins were not responsive to NH2Cl stimulation. The cytotoxic effect of NH2Cl was excluded by both negative lactate dehydrogenase assay and propidium iodide staining. Therefore, NH2Cl-induced morphological changes on nuclear speckles and phosphorylated SRp30 do not result from intestinal epithelial injury. Furthermore, the effect of NH2Cl on nuclear speckles and SRp30 was blocked by bisindolylmaleimide I, a selective PKC inhibitor. Together, the available data suggest that stimulation of intestinal epithelial cells with NH2Cl results in a consequent change on pre-mRNA splicing machinery via a distinctive signal pathway involving activation of PKC.

These results suggest that exosomal mRNA degradation mostly occurs outside of NSs. In support of this possibility, targeting exosome target mRNAs to NSs stabilizes them by preventing exosomal degradation. Furthermore, inhibiting mRNA release from NSs does not attenuate exosomal degradation in normal cells, and results in polyA RNA accumulation both inside and outside of NSs in exosome inactivated cells, suggesting that passage through NSs is not required for sorting mRNAs for degradation or export.

Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export. Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear pores, is not. Upon NXF1 depletion, the TREX protein UAP56 loses speckle concentration but coaccumulates with intronless mRNAs and polyA RNAs in the nucleoplasm, and these RNAs are trapped in NSs upon UAP56 codepletion.

A colour Doppler ultrasound test and magnetic resonance angiography revealed a high-flow scalp arteriovenous fistula with a feeder vessel from the distal superficial temporal artery, which drained into the corresponding, dilated, tortuous vein. The patient underwent diagnostic digital subtraction angiography. This was followed by transarterial embolisation of the fistula using a 50 per cent mixture of n-butyl cyanoacrylate glue and Lipiodol®, with manual distal venous occlusion. A successful outcome was achieved with instant relief of symptoms.CONCLUSION: Cirsoid aneurysms of the facial region, an uncommon cause of tinnitus, can be effectively managed by endovascular embolisation.

All except one patient were males who were in the second and third decades of life. History of trauma was present in 6 patients. In one patient, the lesion had been present since birth. Occipital and frontal regions were the sites commonly involved. Superficial temporal, occipital and posterior auricular arteries were the most frequent feeding arteries. The size ranged from 3 cms to 12 cms. Following investigations were done: CT, MRI, MRA, angiography and Doppler studies.FINDINGS: Excision of the lesion was done in 8 patients and en bloc resection of the lesion with the scalp with reconstruction was done in the remaining three. One among the three patients who underwent en bloc resection had undergone prior surgery. None of the patients underwent preoperative endovascular treatment. One patient had undergone intralesional injection of sclerosing agents twice. Superficial scalp necrosis occurred in two patients but was treated successfully.

Control and stressed cells were double stained with FUS and the stress marker TIA-R.RESULTS: Fibroblasts from healthy controls and sporadic ALS cases showed a prominent nuclear FUS expression. In the 2 FUS P525L mutation carriers, instead, most cells showed a protein localization in both nucleus and cytoplasm, or exclusively in the cytoplasm. Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic FUS was recruited into stress granules, which showed a time-dependent decrease in all subjects. However, in the FUS P525L fibroblasts, the granules persisted longer, and they were more numerous than those detected in the cells from controls and sporadic ALS patients.CONCLUSIONS: We show that in fibroblasts of FUS P525L mutation carriers, FUS mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it redistributed into stress granules with likely a dose effect, i.e. a higher number of cells with granules, which persist longer, than in controls and ALS cases.

Sam68, belongs to the KH domain family of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), was then confirmed that its KH domain was essential for this recruitment. Nevertheless, Knockdown of Sam68 expression using ShRNA had no effects on SGs assembly, indicating that Sam68 is not a constitutive component of the SGs during EV71 infection. Lastly, we investigated the importance of microtubulin transport to SGs aggregation, and revealed that microtubule depolymerization inhibited SGs formation, suggesting that EV71-induced SGs move throughout the cytoplasm in a microtubule-dependent manner. Taken together, these results illuminated that EV71 infections can induce SGs formation, and Sam68, as a SGs component, migrates alone with SGs dependent on intact microtubule upon the viral infections.

The L02 cell line was treated with LB100 and free fatty acids (FFAs) for 24 h. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil red O staining were performed for histological examination. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expression of Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), total and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), and the proteins involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. The mRNA levels were determined by qPCR. Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK was performed to further examine the exact mechanism of LB100 in NAFLD.RESULTS: LB100 significantly ameliorated HFD-induced obesity, hepatic lipid accumulation and hepatic injury in mice. In addition, LB100 significantly downregulated the protein levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and its lipogenesis target genes, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and fatty acid synthase, and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α, acyl-CoA oxidase 1 and uncoupling protein 2, as well as the upstream mediators Sirt1 and AMPKα in the livers of HFD-fed mice.

Studies have shown that early planning of discharge is essential in reducing length of stay and achieving financial benefit; tools that can help predict discharge disposition would therefore be of use. The Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool (RAPT) is a preoperative survey constructed to predict discharge disposition after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The RAPT was developed and tested on a population of Australian patients undergoing joint replacement, but its validity in other populations is unknown. A low RAPT score is reported to indicate a high risk of needing any form of inpatient rehabilitation after TJA, including short-term nursing facilities.QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: This study attempts (1) to assess predictive accuracy of the RAPT on US patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA); and (2) to determine predictive accuracy of each individual score (1-12).METHODS: Between June 2006 and December 2011, RAPT scores of 3213 patients (1449 THAs; 1764 TKAs) were prospectively captured during the preoperative clinical visit. Scores were stored along with other clinical data, including discharge disposition, in a dedicated database on a secure server. The database was queried by the nursing case manager to retrieve the RAPT scores of all patients captured during this time period. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the scores and determine predictive accuracy.RESULTS: Overall predictive accuracy was 78%. RAPT scores<6 and >10 (of 12) predicted with >90% accuracy discharge to inpatient rehabilitation and home, respectively. Predictive accuracy was lowest for scores between 7 and 10 at 65.2% and almost 50% of patients received scores in this range. Based on our findings, the risk categories in our populations should be high risk<7, intermediate risk 7 to 10, and low risk>10.CONCLUSIONS: The RAPT accurately predicted discharge disposition for high- and low-risk patients in our cohort. Based on our data, intermediate-risk patients should be defined as those with scores of 7 to 10. Predictive accuracy for these patients could potentially be improved through the identification and addition of other factors correlated to discharge disposition. The RAPT allows for identification of patients who are likely to be discharged home or to rehabilitation, which may facilitate preoperative planning of postoperative care.

In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs). We demonstrated that disruption of motifs responsible for RNA recognition and binding not only prevents SG recruitment, but also dramatically increases the protein propensity to aggregate in the cell cytoplasm with formation of juxtanuclear structures displaying typical features of aggresomes. Functional RNA-binding domains from TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) fused to highly aggregation-prone C-terminally truncated FUS protein restored the ability to enter SGs and prevented aggregation of the chimeric protein. Truncated FUS was also able to trap endogenous FUS molecules in the cytoplasmic aggregates.

The Chernobyl accident confirmed that the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer is much higher for foetuses and children and adolescents under 18 years. An epidemiological study showed that intake of iodine tablets could reduce the risk for thyroid cancer by a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other radionuclides that may be released.

The LACE index is one of the most popular predictive tools among hospitals in the United States. The LACE index is a simple tool with 4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency visits in the previous 6 months. The authors applied logistic regression to develop a predictive model for a medium-sized not-for-profit community hospital in California using patient-level data with more specific patient information (including 13 explanatory variables). Specifically, the logistic regression is applied to 2 populations: a general population including all patients and the specific group of patients targeted by the CMS penalty (characterized as ages 65 or older with select conditions). The 2 resulting logistic regression models have a higher sensitivity rate compared to the sensitivity of the LACE index. The C statistic values of the model applied to both populations demonstrate moderate levels of predictive power. The authors also build an economic model to demonstrate the potential financial impact of the use of the model for targeting high-risk patients in a sample hospital and demonstrate that, on balance, whether the hospital gains or loses from reducing readmissions depends on its margin and the extent of its readmission penalties."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"he objective of this study was to calculate the rate of 30-day readmissions and evaluate the accuracy of the LACE index (length of stay, acuity of admission, co-morbidities, and emergency department visits within the last 6 months) for 30-day readmissions in a general hospital population of COPD patients.","answer_start":395}],"question":"What is included in the LACE Index?","id":"5e2b109cfbd6abf43b000002_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Background and objective: Patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a high 30-day hospital readmission rate, which has a large impact on the health care system and patients' quality of life.

A LACE index score was calculated for each patient and assessed using receiver operator characteristic curves.Results: During the study period, 2,662 patients had 5,979 hospitalizations for COPD. Four percent of patients died in hospital and 25% were readmitted within 30 days; 56% of all 30-day readmissions were again due to COPD. The most common reasons for readmission, following COPD, were heart failure, pneumonia, and chest pain. The LACE index had moderate discriminative ability to predict 30-day readmission (C-statistic =0.63).Conclusion: The 30-day hospital readmission rate was 25% following hospitalization for COPD in an Australian tertiary hospital and as such comparable to international published rates.

Recent studies suggest that PD-L1 expression in malignant tumors contributes to an immunosuppressive microenvironment and disruption of antitumoral immune response. Drugs targeting this pathway are already tested in clinical trials against several tumor entities with promising results. However, until now comprehensive data with regard to PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is still lacking.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression via immunohistochemistry in two independent cohorts of 293 HNSCC patients.RESULTS: A significant subset of HNSCC showed high expression levels of PD-L1. Most remarkable, we detected a strong correlation between PD-L1 expression and overall survival time in both HNSCC cohorts. Further, in multivariate cox proportional hazard models, PD-L1 dominates as the strongest prognostic factor of patient's outcome in HNSCC, leaving even tumor stage and distant metastasis behind. Moreover, strong PD-L1 expression was associated with the presence of distant metastases in a subset of cases.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, while the significance of PD-L2 in HNSCC seems to minor, we show that PD-L1 expression is common in HNSCC and, more importantly, a both robust and strong prognostic biomarker. In this respect, our results provide hints on further application of therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in HNSCC. Investigation of response and outcome of patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 containing therapies in correlation with PD-L1 expression analysis should be an important task for the future.STATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: In spite of improved treatment options and increasing knowledge of molecular alterations in HNSCC, the survival rate has not been dramatically changed in the past decades. Pies are missing in HNSCC. One promising candidate in cancer immune therapy is PD-L1. Drugs targeting PD-L1 or its receptor PD-1 are subject of several clinical studies in different cancer entities. However, comprehensive data about PD-L1 expression in HNSCC and therefore a rational basis for anti PD-L1/PD-1 therapy in HNSCC is lacking. Here, we provide wide-ranging data about PD-L1 expression in HNSCC of all major localizations. We observed a strong correlation between expression of PD-L1 and reduced overall survival time.

Similar to several other tumors, NENs possess immune-escape mechanisms, but very little has yet been done to characterize this crucial aspect. There are no available data describing PD-L1 expression in these tumors. Here we provide, for the first time, evidence of PD-L1 tissue expression in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs). PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with a high-grade WHO classification (G3) (P<0.001) but not with gender, primary site, or lymph node status. The PD-L1 positivity rate and signal intensity are directly correlated (P<0.001) with a grade increase from G1 to G3. In particular in G3 cases, we observed a dichotomy between the morphology (WD- and PD-NENs) and Ki67. Moreover, our study demonstrated a significant association with the grade and PD-L1 expression levels in immune-infiltrating cells (P<0.001). In particular, G3 tumors are characterized by strong PD-L1 expression in both the tumor and infiltrating immune cells (P<0.001), reflecting an unfavorable environment for T-cell-mediated tumor aggression. These findings suggest that NENs might acquire resistance to immune surveillance by upregulating PD-L1 and inhibiting peritumoral and intratumoral infiltrating lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate that PD-L1 is currently the best-known biomarker for G3 NENs, becoming the new gold standard for G3 NEN discrimination. Furthermore, pharmacological approaches using anti-PD-1 antibodies may become the logical choice for the treatment of G3 cases with a poor prognosis."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is a validated biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is often also used to select patients for CIT in the context of gastroesophageal cancer, although this marker has not been validated for this purpose.

Most recently, two phase III first-line NSCLC studies have provided evidence that tumour mutational burden (TMB) correlates with the clinical response to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (CheckMate-227; NCT02477826), whereas atezolizumab response was correlated with T effector gene signature expression (IMPower 150; NCT02366143). Both studies demonstrated a significant primary endpoint [progression-free survival (PFS)] benefit in the TMB group and in the group of patients expressing a T effector cell signature, respectively. However, PFS benefit in both studies was seen regardless of the PD-L1 status of all patients suggesting that TMB and T effector cell signatures may be more robust to predict clinical response following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors.

Despite advances in adjuvant therapies in recent years, the prognosis of these tumors has not improved. In fact, there are currently no consensus guidelines for the treatment of these neoplasms and the search for targetable biomarkers has not been successful so far. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. In normal conditions, PD-L1 is thought to promote immune homeostasis via a number of pathways, but mainly through downregulation of cytotoxic T cells. In some human neoplasms, however, overexpression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been observed, which can modulate the immune system to allow cancer cells to evade host response. As this marker could potentially be a therapeutic target for these tumors, the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in a group of carcinosarcomas was evaluated in the present study.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine cases of gynecologic carcinosarcomas were analyzed, corresponding to tumors originating from the uterus (25), ovary (2), fallopian tube (1), and pelvic epithelium (1). Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 was performed on paraffin sections and the staining results were assessed semiquantitatively in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of each tumor.RESULTS: Positive membranous staining for PD-L1 was detected in 25/29 tumors (86%). The epithelial components were strongly positive in 19/29 (65%) and weakly positive in 6/29 tumors (21%). The mesenchymal elements were strongly positive in 8/29 (27%) and weakly positive in 3/29 tumors (10%). With exception of 1, all tumors with positive sarcomatous components had staining of the carcinomatous element. Four tumors were negative for PD-L1 in both components.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PD-L1 is expressed by the majority of carcinosarcomas, predominantly in the epithelial components. This is particularly important as most locoregional recurrences and distant metastases are of epithelial origin. This finding may serve as a basis for possible therapeutic approaches using antibodies that have already shown significant value in a number of other malignant tumors."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"This is becoming a much debated issue, and the immunohistochemical detection of Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), the ligand for the inhibitory Programmed Death receptor 1 (PD-1) checkpoint, is one possible biomarker.","answer_start":545}],"question":"Which are the problems associated with the use of PD-L1 as immunotherapy biomarker?","id":"5c7a4a31d774d04240000006_021","is_impossible":false}],"context":"CONTEXT: Although most primary cancers of the lung carry a heavy mutational load and will potentially present many \"nonself\" antigens to the immune system, there are a wide range of possible mechanisms for tumors to avoid so-called immune surveillance.

Significant increases of intracellular symbionts were common to both models and to reported changes in rodents suggesting universality of these findings post-radiation. Remarkably, opposite dynamics were observed for the main phyla, with increase of Firmicutes and decrease of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in minipigs but with enrichment of Bacteroidetes in rhesus macaques.

Here, we show that a shift in the gut bacterial composition and structure by sterilizing irradiation, characterized by a decrease in the major gut microbiota community Enterobacteriaceae, an expansion of the minor members (e.g., Bacillaceae) and a higher richness and diversity, is tightly linked to radiation-induced ecological fitness (male mating competitiveness, flight capacity, survival rate and life span) decline in Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) sterile males. Function prediction of gut microbiota indicated that changes in microbiome taxonomy tend to drive microbiome functional shifts. A higher nutrient consumption of the flourishing minor gut microbiota may cause a decline in nutrients and energy metabolic activity of host and then result in the reduced ecological fitness of irradiated flies.

Postoperative side effects were also recorded. Results: The mean age at disease onset was 42.31 ± 7.29 years [28-58] and the mean age at surgery was 54.66 ± 8.51 years [34-70]. The median disease duration was 11.95 ± 4.28 years [5-22]. Sixty-three percentage of patients were male. 11.4% of patients were tremor dominant while 45.71 showed akinetic-rigid form and 42.90 were classified as mixed phenotype. The LEDD before surgery was 1200 mg/day [800-1500]. All patients had motor fluctuations whereas non-motor fluctuations were present in 61.80% of cases. STN DBS decreased the LEDD by 51.72%, as the mean LEDD post-surgery was 450 [188-800]. The UPDRS-III was improved by 52.27%, dyskinesia score by 66.70% and motor fluctuations by 50%, whereas QOL improved by 27.12%. Post-operative side effects were hypophonia (2 cases), infection (3 cases), and pneumocephalus (2 cases). Conclusion: Our results showed that STN DBS is an effective treatment in Moroccan Parkinsonian patients leading to a major improvement of the most disabling symptoms (dyskinesia, motor fluctuation) and a better QOL."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The total K-SCOPA-AUT score showed a positive correlation with other non-motor symptoms [the Korean version of non-motor symptom scale (K-NMSS)], activities of daily living (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II) and quality of life [the Korean version of Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life 39 (K-PDQ39)].","answer_start":1235}],"question":"PDQ39 questionnaires is design for which disease?","id":"5e2b1ed9fbd6abf43b000005_007","is_impossible":false}],"context":"OBJECTIVE: Autonomic symptoms are commonly observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and often limit the activities of daily living.

The four sessions at this meeting were focused on: (1) molecular and immune advances; (2) combination therapies; (3) news in immunotherapy; and 4) tumor microenvironment and biomarkers. Recent advances in tumor biology and immunology has led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic agents that prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of cancer patients. Immunotherapies in particular have emerged as highly successful approaches to treat patients with cancer including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and Hodgkin's disease. Specifically, many clinical successes have been using checkpoint receptor blockade, including T cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. Despite demonstrated successes, responses to immunotherapy interventions occur only in a minority of patients. Attempts are being made to improve responses to immunotherapy by developing biomarkers. Optimizing biomarkers for immunotherapy could help properly select patients for treatment and help to monitor response, progression and resistance that are critical challenges for the immuno-oncology (IO) field. Importantly, biomarkers could help to design rational combination therapies. In addition, biomarkers may help to define mechanism of action of different agents, dose selection and to sequence drug combinations. However, biomarkers and assays development to guide cancer immunotherapy is highly challenging for several reasons: (i) multiplicity of immunotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action including immunotherapies that target activating and inhibitory T cell receptors (e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.); adoptive T cell therapies that include tissue infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and T cell receptor (TCR) modified T cells; (ii) tumor heterogeneity including changes in antigenic profiles over time and location in individual patient; and (iii) a variety of immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) including T regulatory cells (Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and immunosuppressive cytokines. In addition, complex interaction of tumor-immune system further increases the level of difficulties in the process of biomarkers development and their validation for clinical use. Recent clinical trial results have highlighted the potential for combination therapies that include immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Agents targeting other immune inhibitory (e.g., Tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., CD137) receptors on T cells and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer are tested for clinical efficacy in melanoma as well. These agents are also being tested in combination with targeted therapies to improve upon shorter-term responses thus far seen with targeted therapy. Various locoregional interventions that demonstrate promising results in treatment of advanced melanoma are also integrated with immunotherapy agents and the combinations with cytotoxic chemotherapy and inhibitors of angiogenesis are changing the evolving landscape of therapeutic options and are being evaluated to prevent or delay resistance and to further improve survival rates for melanoma patients' population. This meeting's specific focus was on advances in immunotherapy and combination therapy for melanoma. The importance of understanding of melanoma genomic background for development of novel therapies and biomarkers for clinical application to predict the treatment response was an integral part of the meeting. The overall emphasis on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward integrating biomarkers into personalized-medicine approach for treatment of patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. Translation of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across different tumors represents a bridge to impact on prognosis and response to therapy in melanoma. We also discussed the requirements for pre-analytical and analytical as well as clinical validation process as applied to biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. The concept of the fit-for-purpose marker validation has been introduced to address the challenges and strategies for analytical and clinical validation design for specific assays."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"We found immune activation coexistent with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, TIM-3, B7-H3, BTLA, and CTLA-4, along with increases in tumor infiltration by CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in lung adenocarcinomas that displayed an EMT phenotype","answer_start":1181}],"question":"Is TIM-3 a target for cancer immunotherapy in NSCLC?","id":"5c7a4c35d774d04240000007_005","is_impossible":false}],"context":"PURPOSE: Promising results in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been seen with agents targeting immune checkpoints, such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1).

The identification of biomarkers that predict clinical benefit to immune checkpoint blockade is critical to successful clinical translation of these agents.METHODS: We conducted an integrated analysis of three independent large datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas of lung adenocarcinoma and two datasets from MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), Profiling of Resistance Patterns and Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Evaluation of Cancers of the Thorax (named PROSPECT) and Biomarker-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination (named BATTLE-1). Comprehensive analysis of mRNA gene expression, reverse-phase protein array, IHC, and correlation with clinical data were performed.RESULTS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is highly associated with an inflammatory tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma, independent of tumor mutational burden. We found immune activation coexistent with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, TIM-3, B7-H3, BTLA, and CTLA-4, along with increases in tumor infiltration by CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in lung adenocarcinomas that displayed an EMT phenotype.

We performed comprehensive flow cytometric immunoprofiling on both tumor and immune cells from 51 NSCLCs and integrated this analysis with clinical and histopathologic characteristics, next-generation sequencing, mRNA expression, and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS. Cytometric profiling identified an immunologically \"hot\" cluster with abundant CD8+ T cells expressing high levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 and an immunologically \"cold\" cluster with lower relative abundance of CD8+ T cells and expression of inhibitory markers. The \"hot\" cluster was highly enriched for expression of genes associated with T cell trafficking and cytotoxic function and high PD-L1 expression by IHC. There was no correlation between immunophenotype and KRAS or EGFR mutation, or patient smoking history, but we did observe an enrichment of squamous subtype and tumors with higher mutation burden in the \"hot\" cluster.

Our previous work has identified a novel ligand/receptor pair, LLT1/CD161, that modulates immune responses. Here, we extensively characterize its expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We show that LLT1 expression is restricted to germinal center (GC) B cells within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), representing a new hallmark of the presence of active TLS in the tumor microenvironment. CD161-expressing immune cells are found at the vicinity of these structures, with a global enrichment of NSCLC tumors in CD161+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as compared to normal distant lung and peripheral blood. CD161+ CD4+ T cells are more activated and produce Th1-cytokines at a higher frequency than their matched CD161-negative counterparts.

A half century ago, suggestions had already been made to use protons themselves to develop images of tumors and surrounding tissue, to be used for treatment planning. The recent global expansion of hadron therapy, coupled with modern advances in computation and particle detection, has led several collaborations around the world to develop prototype detector systems and associated reconstruction codes for proton computed tomography (pCT), as well as more simple proton radiography, with the ultimate intent to use such systems in clinical treatment planning and verification.

This review introduces hadron therapy and the perceived advantages of pCT and proton radiography for treatment planning, reviews its historical development, and discusses the physics related to proton imaging, the associated experimental and computation issues, the technologies used to attack the problem, contemporary efforts in detector and computational development, and the current status and outlook."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"INTRODUCTION: Grade IV vestibular schwannoma (Koos classification) is generally considered to be an indication for microsurgical resection or combined radiosurgery-microsurgery.","answer_start":0}],"question":"Which disease can be classified using the Koos Classification?","id":"5e2b2c85fbd6abf43b000007_001","is_impossible":false}],"context":"INTRODUCTION: Grade IV vestibular schwannoma (Koos classification) is generally considered to be an indication for microsurgical resection or combined radiosurgery-microsurgery. However, the place of Gamma Knife stereotactic surgery (GK-SRS), either as first-line treatment or when progression of residual tumor compresses the brainstem, has not been clearly evaluated. This article reports the results of a large case series of patients with grade 4 vestibular schwannoma treated by GK-SRS.MATERIAL AND METHOD: All consecutive patients with grade IV vestibular schwannoma treated by GK-SRS in our department between 1996 and 2011 with a minimum follow-up of 3 years were included in this study.RESULTS: 86 patients were treated by GK-SRS with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Mean follow-up was 6.2 years (3-16 years). The mean age of the patients at the time of GK-SRS was 54.6 years (range: 23-84) and the sex ratio was 0.6. At the time of radiosurgery, no patient presented brainstem dysfunction prior to GK-SRS. 38 patients had functional hearing before treatment. One patient presented mild trigeminal neuralgia before GK-SRS. Tumor control with no clinical deterioration was obtained in 78 patients (90.7%). No radiation-induced brainstem or cranial nerve toxicity was observed in any of these patients. Functional hearing was maintained in 25 patients. 8 (9.3%) patients presented tumor growth and required microsurgical resection in 7 cases and ventricular shunt in 1 case.CONCLUSION: On the basis of this large series, GK-SRS appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for grade IV vestibular schwannoma for patients with no signs of brainstem dysfunction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Microsurgery, radiotherapy and observation groups comprised 43, 46 and 53 patients, respectively. All patients completed four QOL (questionnaires: Short-Form Health Survey 36, Hearing Handicap Inventory, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Dizziness Handicap Inventory Short-Form). Clinical symptoms and QOL were compared among groups.RESULTS: The average time interval between management and filling in the questionnaires was 66 months. There was no difference in QOL between the three groups on any of the four questionnaires. The most debilitating symptom was vertigo for all three groups. Tinnitus was a pejorative factor in the surgery group. Hearing level was deteriorated after microsurgery but there was no significant difference between the radiotherapy group and the middle fossa approach.CONCLUSION: Patients with small VS stage 1 and 2 had similar QOL, irrespective of management by observation, radiotherapy or microsurgery. The overall predictor for long-term reduced QOL was vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation could improve QOL in symptomatic patients.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"BACKGROUND: The Koos classification of vestibular schwannomas is designed to stratify tumors based on extrameatal extension and compression of the brainstem.

The deletion eliminates a genome topological domain boundary, allowing normally forbidden interactions between at least three forebrain-directed enhancers and the LMNB1 promoter, in line with the observed mainly cerebral localization of lamin B1 overexpression and myelin degeneration.

Using multi-parametric photoacoustic microscopy, we show that intradermal injection of AZD8601 formulated in a biocompatible vehicle results in pronounced, sustained and dose-dependent vasodilation, blood flow upregulation, and neovessel formation, in striking contrast to those induced by recombinant human VEGF-A protein, a non-translatable variant of AZD8601, and citrate/saline vehicle. Moreover, we evaluate the bioactivity of AZD8601 in a mouse model of diabetic wound healing in vivo. Using a boron nanoparticle-based tissue oxygen sensor, we show that sequential dosing of AZD8601 improves vascularization and tissue oxygenation of the wound bed, leading to accelerated re-epithelialization during the early phase of diabetic wound healing."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"An important effort to advance radiobiology in the genomic era was establishment of the Radiogenomics Consortium to enable the creation of the large radiotherapy cohorts required to exploit advances in genomics.","answer_start":1167}],"question":"What is the aim of the \"Radiogenomics Consortium\"?","id":"5e48efd9f8b2df0d49000004_001","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Radiobiology research is building the foundation for applying genomics in precision radiation oncology. Advances in high-throughput approaches will underpin increased understanding of radiosensitivity and the development of future predictive assays for clinical application. There is an established contribution of genetics as a risk factor for radiotherapy side effects. An individual's radiosensitivity is an inherited polygenic trait with an architecture that includes rare mutations in a few genes that confer large effects and common variants in many genes with small effects. Current thinking is that some will be tissue specific, and future tests will be tailored to the normal tissues at risk. The relationship between normal and tumor cell radiosensitivity is poorly understood. Data are emerging suggesting interplay between germline genetic variation and epigenetic modification with growing evidence that changes in DNA methylation regulate the radiosensitivity of cancer cells and histone acetyltransferase inhibitors have radiosensitizing effects. Changes in histone methylation can also impair DNA damage response signaling and alter radiosensitivity. An important effort to advance radiobiology in the genomic era was establishment of the Radiogenomics Consortium to enable the creation of the large radiotherapy cohorts required to exploit advances in genomics. To address challenges in harmonizing data from multiple cohorts, the consortium established the REQUITE project to collect standardized data and genotyping for ~5,000 patients. The collection of detailed dosimetric data is important to produce validated multivariable models.

In this study, noncontact co-cultures of rat primary BMSCs and VECs were employed to interrogate paracrine cell-to-cell communications in response to tension. Exposure of VECs to 6% tension for 48 h elicited neither ALP activity nor mRNA expression of OCN and OPN in BMSCs incubated in a shared culture medium. Instead, BMSCs subjected to tension induced robust VEGF release, and its conditioned medium enhanced the proliferation and tubular formation of VECs with a concurrent increase in BMP-2 and IGF-1 production. Conditioned medium from activated VECs in turn promoted expression of osteogenic genes in BMSCs, followed by an increase in matrix mineralization. The addition of VEGF-R inhibitor Tivozanib to these systems abrogated the tension-induced paracrine effects on VECs and subsequently impaired BMSC osteogenesis.

Here we show that expression of the VEGF family is higher in therapy-resistant EOC cells compared to sensitive ones.

However, largely because of the extremely low number of CTCs (as low as 1 in 10(9) hematologic cells) in the blood of patients, effective detection and separation of the rare cells remain a tremendous challenge. Cell rolling is known to play a key role in physiological processes such as the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation and selectin-mediated CTC metastasis. Furthermore, because CTCs typically express the epithelial-cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on the surface whereas normal hematologic cells do not, substrates with immobilized antibody against EpCAM may specifically interact with CTCs. In this article, we created biomimetic surfaces functionalized with P- and E-selectin and anti-EpCAM that induce different responses in HL-60 (used as a model of leukocytes in this study) and MCF-7 (a model of CTCs) cells. HL-60 and MCF-7 cells showed different degrees of interaction with P-/E-selectin and anti-EpCAM at a shear stress of 0.32 dyn/cm(2). HL-60 cells exhibited rolling on P-selectin-immobilized substrates at a velocity of 2.26 +/- 0.28 microm/s whereas MCF-7 cells had no interaction with the surface. Both cell lines, however, had interactions with E-selectin, and the rolling velocity of MCF-7 cells (4.24 +/- 0.31 microm/s) was faster than that of HL-60 cells (2.12 +/- 0.15 microm/s). However, only MCF-7 cells interacted with anti-EpCAM-coated surfaces, forming stationary binding under flow. More importantly, the combination of the rolling (E-selectin) and stationary binding (anti-EpCAM) resulted in substantially enhanced separation capacity and capture efficiency (more than 3-fold enhancement), as compared to a surface functionalized solely with anti-EpCAM that has been commonly used for CTC capture.

Here, we described a ratiometric fluorescent probe for the efficient capture and accurate determination of CTCs by conjugating graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g-CNQDs) with gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and further linking with anti-EpCAM antibody to acquire the CTC-specific immune probe. In this probe, AuNCs protected by albumin V bovine played the role as the fluorophore reference and anti-EpCAM-attached g-CNQDs acted as both the response signal and specific recognition element for sensing CTCs. In the presence of CTCs, the quenched fluorescence of the immune probe at 500 nm was recovered due to the detachment of anti-EpCAM from the probe, whereas the intensity at 650 nm was essentially unchanged. This strategy realized the highly sensitive detection of CTCs in whole blood down to one CTC. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the designed probe allowed capturing living CTCs with minimal cell damage. The subsequent reculture of captured cells for proliferation revealed that after a 7 day proliferation, almost 28 MCF-7 cells were obtained from one target cell.

Maximal Digestive toxicity (MDT) and maximal urinary toxicity (MUT) were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v3.0 scale. RILA was assessed using flow cytometry.Results: 245 patients were included in our study. After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the MDT and MUT reached grade 3-4 in 37 patients and 56 patients, respectively. Patients with prostatectomy exhibited a statistically higher grade of MUT compared with those treated with definitive radiotherapy (p=0.03). The median RILA values were 11.8% and 15.3% for CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes, respectively. We found no significant correlation between CD4 or CD8 RILA and either MDT or MUT.Conclusion: RILA does not correlate with the inter-individual variation in MDT or MUT in the largest cohort of patients overexposed to radiation.

In contrast to these observations there are now numerous examples to suggest that a number of tumours escape this CTL-mediated control either by down-regulating accessory molecules or by blocking the intracellular processing of tumour-specific antigens. Recently a number of tumour cell lines have been identified which display a transcriptional deficiency of transporters associated with antigen processing (also referred to as TAP). The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumour, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), is a classic example in this category. In the present study we have restored class I-restricted antigen processing in a BL cell line by transfecting a minigene expression vector encoding a CTL epitope derived from EBV linked to an endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal sequence. These minigene transfected BL cells were not only susceptible to lysis by virus-specific CTL but were also capable of efficiently activating an antigen-specific CTL response. Interestingly, the immunogenicity of these BL cells was not affected by the significantly down-regulated expression of adhesion molecules such as LFA1 alpha, LFA1 beta and LFA3.

The first true clinical progress with immunotherapy developed from the application of recombinant DNA technology for the large scale production of immunostimulant cytokines. Clinical trials demonstrated that the systemic administration of recombinant high-dose bolus intravenous interleukin-2 (IL-2; 720 000 IU/kg every 8 hours) mediated objective tumour progression in 20% of patients with metastatic renal cancer and in 17% of patients with metastatic melanoma, with complete responses of 9% and 7%, respectively. The use of adoptive immunotherapy (the transfer of immune cells with anti-tumour activity to the tumour-bearing host) focused interest on T lymphocyte-mediated tumour recognition. Clinical trials described the systemic administration of lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells and subsequently tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) to patients with advanced cancer. Although able to kill tumour targets in vitro, LAK cells did not prove useful for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cancer. A randomised trial, in which IL-2 was administered alone or with LAK cells, failed to show a difference in response rate or survival. In contrast, the treatment of 86 patients with metastatic melanoma using TIL plus IL-2 resulted in a 34% objective response rate, which included patients who had previously failed treatment with high-dose IL-2 alone. The focus on cellular immune responses, combined with rapid biotechnological advances, resulted in the identification of tumour specific antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, that could be recognised by autologous TIL. This provided fundamental evidence of the existence of melanoma-associated antigens that were recognised in vivo by effector cells of the immune system. In vitro studies demonstrated immunodominant epitopes from MART-1 and gp100 that could induce in vitro-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte reactivity. To enhance in vitro immunogenicity, single amino acid substitutions were made to identify peptides with higher affinity for HLA-A*0201. Modified peptides from gp100 were compared with the parental peptide for increased immunogenicity based on their ability to induce anti-tumour lymphocytes in vitro. From these studies, a candidate peptide was identified (G9-209-2M) which had increased immunogenic reactivity in vitro. Clinical trials demonstrated that the modified G9-209-2M peptide was more effective. Unfortunately, objective tumour regression was still low. However, when high-dose IL-2 was combined with G9-209-2M objective clinical responses increased to 42%. Efforts to find better ways to immunise against self antigens are ongoing and involve further peptide immunisations, as well as recombinant viral vectors, adjuvant cytokine therapy and cellular adjuvants such as dendritic cells."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":" Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity, because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system.","answer_start":800}],"question":"Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?","id":"5c7f806d617e120c34000001_005","is_impossible":false}],"context":"The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed.

Most cancer cells lack major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and cannot present tumour-specific antigens (TSA) directly to CD4(+) T cells. We have reported that tumour-specific CD4(+) T cells collaborate with macrophages and dendritic cells. These professional antigen-presenting cells endocytose and process TSA to display antigenic peptides on their MHC class II molecules for indirect cancer cell recognition by CD4(+) T cells. We hypothesized that this critical step may depend on secretion of TSA by cancer cells. This was investigated in a mouse model for myeloma immunosurveillance mediated by CD4(+) T cells. From this study, several conclusions could be drawn. First, TSA secretion facilitates cancer immunosurveillance. Second, TSA secretion results in stronger activation of naïve tumour-specific CD4(+) T cells in lymph nodes. Third, TSA concentration within the tumour extracellular matrix must reach a certain threshold to allow successful cancer immunosurveillance. Fourth, treatment by local injection of purified TSA enhances immunity against cancer cells that do not secrete TSA. Fifth, secretion of TSA by at least some cancer cells within a tumour favours antitumour immunity. Therefore, we propose that CD4(+) T cells that recognize secreted TSA may be superior for immunotherapy by T cell transfer, because the local extracellular antigen concentration will be higher for secreted TSA. Thus, it is anticipated that secreted TSA will be more readily detected in vivo by transferred CD4(+) T cells, resulting in more efficient tumour eradication."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":" Here, we wondered whether these frame-shifted peptide (FSP) sequences represent tumour-specific antigens also for MSI(+) leukaemia and lymphomas (L/L).","answer_start":305}],"question":"Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?","id":"5c7f806d617e120c34000001_009","is_impossible":false}],"context":"PURPOSE: Microsatellite instability (MSI) resulting from loss of functional DNA mismatch repair was recently found in various haematological disorders.

Forty-two cortical tissue specimens were excised from three bovine femurs and irradiated to 35 and 70 kGy gamma rays in the presence of 5, 50, and 100 mM concentrations of NAC. The localized variations in microhardness were evaluated via indentation in the radial and longitudinal directions to examine different regions of the microstructures of the specimens, including the osteonal and interstitial tissues. A significant increase was observed in the hardness of osteonal, interstitial, and longitudinal combined microstructures exposed to 35 and 70 kGy radiations (P < 0.05), whereas a relative reduction of the hardness was observed in the radial direction. Furthermore, it was found that the application of 50 and 100 mM NAC during gamma irradiation significantly subsided the hardening in longitudinal combined microstructure. Moreover, the reduction of hardness in radial direction was suppressed in the presence of 100 mM of NAC.

This effect, which is attributed to the formation of free radicals through radiolysis of the water content of collagen, can lead to post-implantation difficulties such as pre-failure and/or secondary fractures of bone allografts. Recently, treatment of irradiated allografts with free radical scavengers is used to protect them against radiation-induced damages. This study aimed to investigate the radioprotective role of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) during the gamma sterilization of the cortical bone of bovine femurs using the compressive test. Totally, 195 cubic specimens with a dimension of 5 × 5 × 3 cubic mm were divided into 13 groups including a control and 12 experimental groups exposed to 18, 36, and 70 kGy at three different NAC concentrations (1.25, 12.5, and 25 mM for 18 kGy; 5, 50, and 100 mM for 36 kGy; 10, 100, and 200 mM for 70 kGy). The mechanical behavior of the sterilized specimens was studied using the uniaxial compressive test. The results indicated a concentration-dependent radioprotection effect of NAC on the plastic properties of the cortical bones. The concentration dependency of NAC was in turn related to radiation dose levels. In conclusion, treatment of bone specimens with a characteristic concentration of NAC during exposure to specific radiation dose levels can provide an efficient radioprotection window for preserving the mechanical stability of gamma sterilized allografts."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"It was determined that gamma sterilization was the preferred sterilization method of choice for this device.

Estimates of whole-body effective dose are based on the assumptions that the radiation is incident from the front and in a uniform beam. We sought to investigate these assumptions and also to quantify doses associated with different activities.METHODS: A single technologist wore 3 electronic dosimeters for 3 mo, at the front waist, the back waist, and the front collar. The technologist also recorded her activities throughout the day.RESULTS: We found that the assumption of an anterior beam held about two thirds of the time, breaking down only when the technologist was receiving lower doses. Overall, the average whole-body dose was estimated correctly by assuming an anterior beam. We also found that irradiation was uniform (i.e., waist and collar badges gave equivalent readings) except when the technologist was performing injections. Then, the collar readings were 1.7 times the waist readings. Finally, average doses were measured for different types of activities. Performing injections registered a dose rate of approximately 2 microSv/h. Doses received while scanning ranged from 0.2 to 2 microSv/h. The average dose for a scan depended not only on the administered activity and isotope but also on the amount of patient contact required. Even for high activities, such as patients who had already received therapy, the dose to the technologist was low for patients requiring little assistance.CONCLUSION: The assumption of anterior irradiation correctly estimates whole-body effective dose. The assumption of a uniform beam is good except when injections are being performed, when the upper torso receives a much higher dose than the waist. Overall, doses to the technologist were found to be 5.4 microSv/d for scanning and 12 microSv/d for injections. These correspond to 1.4 mSv/y and 3.2 mSv/y, respectively, which are comparable to naturally occurring radiation levels and are much lower than regulatory limits. However, if the dose to a particular technologist needs to be minimized (e.g., for a pregnant worker), the most effective strategy is for the technologist to be assigned patients requiring little contact or assistance and, in particular, to avoid administering injections."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":" The reconstruction of lifetime radiation doses for medical workers presents special challenges not commonly encountered for the other worker cohorts comprising the Million Worker Study (MWS)","answer_start":11}],"question":"Who should wear dosimeters?","id":"5e49032df8b2df0d49000008_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"BACKGROUND: The reconstruction of lifetime radiation doses for medical workers presents special challenges not commonly encountered for the other worker cohorts comprising the Million Worker Study (MWS).METHODS: The selection of approximately 175,000 medical radiation workers relies on using estimates of lifetime and annual personal monitoring results collected since 1977.

Only a few cohorts have been reported. The objective of the present study was to characterize the various spectra of adrenal function in Triple-A patients.METHODS: A retrospective clinical and biological monitoring of 14 patients (10 families) was done in a single multidisciplinary French center. All had AAAS gene sequenced and adrenal function evaluation.RESULTS: Nine different AAAS mutations were found, including one new mutation: c.755G>C, p.(Trp252Ser). Regarding adrenal function, defects of the zona fasciculata and reticularis were demonstrated by increased basal ACTH levels and low DHEAS levels in all cases regardless of the degree of glucocorticoid deficiency. In contrast, mineralocorticoid function was always conserved: i.e., normal plasma renin level associated with normal aldosterone level.

Between 2006 and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids.

The proteins that tether Tpr to this location are unknown. Moreover, the question whether Tpr itself might act as a scaffold onto which other NPC components need to be assembled has not been answered to date. To assess Tpr's role as an architectural element of the NPC, we have studied the sequential disassembly and reassembly of NPCs in mitotic cells, paralleled by studies of cells depleted of Tpr as a result of posttranscriptional tpr gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi). NPC assembly and recruitment of several nucleoporins, including Nup50, Nup93, Nup96, Nup98, Nup107, and Nup153, in anaphase/early telophase is shown to precede NPC association of Tpr in late telophase. In accordance, cellular depletion of Tpr by RNAi does not forestall binding of these nucleoporins to the NPC. In a search for proteins that moor Tpr to the NPC, we have combined the RNAi approach with affinity-chromatography and yeast two-hybrid interaction studies, leading to the identification of nucleoporin Nup153 as the binding partner for Tpr. The specificity of this interaction is demonstrated by its sensitivity to Tpr amino acid substitution mutations that abolish Tpr's ability to adhere to the NPC and affect the direct binding of Tpr to Nup153. Accordingly, cellular depletion of Nup153 by RNAi is shown to result in mislocalization of Tpr to the nuclear interior. Nup153 deficiency also causes mislocalization of Nup50 but has no direct effect on NPC localization of the other nucleoporins studied in this investigation.

We hypothesise that interleukins play a role in initiation and progression of ochronotic osteoarthropathy. C20/A4 cells were cultured and maintained in 9-cm petri dishes containing either HGA at 0.33 mM, a single interleukin (IL-1β, IL-6 or IL-10) at 1 ng/ml or a combination of HGA and a single interleukin. Statistical analysis of pigment deposits and cell viability was performed using analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls post-test. All cultures containing HGA showed a significant increase in pigment deposition compared to control and IL cultures alone. The cultures containing HGA and IL-6 showed a significant increase in pigment deposits compared to HGA alone. The cell viability counts across all cultures on day 10 demonstrated a significant decrease in cultures containing HGA compared to those which did not. There was no significant difference between cultures containing just HGA or those combined with an interleukin. This work demonstrates a role for cytokines present in the joint(s) in the pigmentation process, particularly IL-6, and that the presence of HGA in joint tissues appears more detrimental to chondrocytes than the presence of any of the interleukins found in response to joint injury, trauma and osteoarthritis (OA).

Detection rates were estimated by meta-analysis and modeling. The marginal cost associated with the detection of additional cases using cfDNA was estimated from the difference in average costs divided by the difference in detection.RESULTS: The main factor was the unit cost of cfDNA testing. For example, replacing a combined test costing $150 with 3% false-positive rate and invasive testing at $1000, by cfDNA tests at $2000, $1500, $1000, and $500, the marginal cost is $8.0, $5.8, $3.6, and $1.4m, respectively. Costs were lower when replacing a quadruple test and higher for a 5% false-positive rate, but the relative importance of cfDNA unit cost was unchanged. A contingent policy whereby 10% to 20% women were selected for cfDNA testing by conventional screening was considerably more cost-efficient. Costs were sensitive to cfDNA uptake.CONCLUSION: Universal cfDNA screening for Down syndrome will only become affordable by public health purchasers if costs fall substantially.

A number of recent technological developments in this area has increased the level of clinical interest, particularly as one approach does not require customized reagents per mutation. The mutational status of the fetus can be assessed by determining which parental haplotype that fetus has inherited based on the detection of haplotype-associated SNP alleles in maternal plasma. Such relative haplotype dosage analysis requires the input of the parental haplotype information for interpretation of the fetal inheritance pattern from the maternal plasma DNA data. The parental haplotype information can be obtained by direct means, reducing the need to infer haplotypes using DNA from other family members. The technique also allows the assessment of complex mutations and has multiplexing capabilities where a number of genes and mutations can be assessed at the same time.

Amantadine is an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that can be effective against postoperative pain.OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the efficacy of amantadine in alleviating the postoperative pain of mandibular fracture surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this double-blind study, 60 patients (ASA physical status I-II) were randomly divided into two groups. The mean ages of the participants were 31.2 ± 13.1 years and 32.3 ± 18.1 years, respectively. The male/female ratios were 24/6 and 26/4, respectively, in the case and control groups. Randomization was based on a single sequence of random assignments using computer-generated random numbers. Group I was given oral amantadine 100 mg 1 hour before surgery, and group II received a placebo at the identical time. Through PCA pumps, patients received a bolus dose of morphine at 0.02 mg/kg body weight, to a maximum of 1.5 mg. PCA pumps were set at 6 minutes lockout intervals and a maximum dose of 0.15 mg/kg/h, to a maximum of 10 mg/h. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months after surgery. The amounts of analgesic consumed were recorded for the first 24 hours, and for 6 months after surgery.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to age, gender, nausea and vomiting, sleep quality, blood pressure, and heart rate. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in pain scores (P = 0.39) and analgesic consumption (P = 0.78).CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a single dose of preoperative oral amantadine did not reduce acute or chronic postoperative pain, nor analgesic consumption."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Molecular radiotherapy with tumor-targeted radionuclides may overcome some of these challenges","answer_start":311}],"question":"What is molecular radiotherapy?","id":"5e499c636d0a27794100000a_001","is_impossible":false}],"context":"External-beam radiotherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of most pediatric solid tumors. Particularly in children, achieving an optimal therapeutic index to avoid damage to normal tissue is extremely important. Consequently, in metastatic disease, the utility of external-beam radiotherapy is limited. Molecular radiotherapy with tumor-targeted radionuclides may overcome some of these challenges, but to date there exists no single cancer-selective agent capable of treating various pediatric malignancies independently of their histopathologic origin. We tested the therapeutic potential of the clinical-grade alkyl-phospholipid ether analog CLR1404, 18-(p-iodophenyl)octadecyl phosphocholine, as a scaffold for tumor-targeted radiotherapy of pediatric malignancies. Methods: Uptake of CLR1404 by pediatric solid tumor cells was tested in vitro by flow cytometry and in vivo by PET/CT imaging and dosimetry. The therapeutic potential of 131I-CLR1404 was evaluated in xenograft models. Results: In vitro, fluorescent CLR1404-BODIPY showed significant selective uptake in a variety of pediatric cancer lines compared with normal controls. In vivo tumor-targeted uptake in mouse xenograft models using 124I-CLR1404 was confirmed by imaging. Single-dose intravenous injection of 131I-CLR1404 significantly delayed tumor growth in all rodent pediatric xenograft models and extended animal survival while demonstrating a favorable side effect profile. Conclusion:131I-CLR1404 has the potential to become a tumor-targeted radiotherapeutic drug with broad applicability in pediatric oncology.

Sections were examined blinded to clinical information and scored for the percentage and intensity of tumour cells stained. These data were analysed in conjunction with clinical data.RESULTS: Tissue from 75 patients was examined. Target expression scores varied widely between patients: NAT median 45%, inter-quartile range 25% - 65%; and SSTR2 median 55%, interquartile range 30% - 80%; and in some cases heterogeneity of expression between different parts of a tumour was observed. A weak positive correlation was observed between the expression scores of the different targets: correlation coefficient = 0.23, p = 0.05. MYCN amplified tumours had lower SSTR2 scores: mean difference 23% confidence interval 8% - 39%, p < 0.01.

We examined the incremental effects of 2 (full dose) plus K(+) supplementation versus single polycap (low dose) on risk factors and tolerability.METHODS AND RESULTS: After a run-in period, 518 individuals with previous vascular disease or diabetes mellitus from 27 centers in India were randomly assigned to a single-dose polycap or to 2 capsules of the polycap plus K(+) supplementation for 8 weeks. The effects on BP, heart rate (HR), serum lipids, serum and urinary K(+), and tolerability were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis. The full-dose polycap (plus K(+) supplementation) reduced BP by a further 2.8 mm Hg systolic and 1.7 mm Hg diastolic, compared with that observed with the low-dose polycap (P=0.003; P=0.001), but there were no differences in HR (0.1 bpm). The differences in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol between the full-dose and low-dose polycap was 7.2 mg/dL (P=0.014) and 6.6 mg/dL (P=0.006), respectively, but there were no differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides.

Plasma concentrations of each drug and, where applicable, its active metabolite were measured using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters and their standard deviations were computed for each analyte.RESULTS: Comparative bioavailability was computed and no drug-drug interactions and no difference in comparative bioavailability were concluded for each ingredient based on point estimates of the T/R ratio of the geometric means falling within 80-125% for peak plasma concentration (C(max)), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC(t)), and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)). The T/R ratio for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) was within 80-125% for atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, ramiprilat and dose-normalized salicylic acid. However, for simvastatin, the T/R point estimates for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) for Ln-transformed data were significantly lower ( approximately 3-4%) than the lower bound of 80%. For its active metabolite, simvastatin acid, these estimates were significantly higher ( approximately 25-35%) than the higher bound of 125%.

When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population.FINDINGS: SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and divergence patterns consistent with selection sweeps by evaluating allele frequencies in windows, including neighboring loci from two or more populations of a diploid species against the genome-wide neutral expectation. The program calculates the mean of heterozygosity and FST in a set of sliding windows of incrementally increasing sizes, and then builds a resampled distribution (the baseline) of random multi-locus sets matched to the sizes of sliding windows, using an unrestricted sampling. Percentiles of the values in the sliding windows are derived from the superimposed resampled distribution. The resampling can easily be scaled from 1 K to 100 M; the higher the number, the more precise the percentiles ascribed to the extreme observed values.CONCLUSIONS: The output from SmileFinder can be used to plot percentile values to look for population diversity and divergence patterns that may suggest past actions of positive selection along chromosome maps, and to compare lists of suspected candidate genes under random gene sets to test for the overrepresentation of these patterns among gene categories. Both applications of the algorithm have already been used in published studies.

The model of genetic hitchhiking predicts that strong positive selection affects the patterns of linkage disequilibrium around the site of a beneficial allele, resulting in specific motifs of correlation between neutral polymorphisms that surround the fixed beneficial allele. Increased levels of linkage disequilibrium are observed on the same side of a beneficial allele, and diminish between sites on different sides of a beneficial mutation. This specific pattern of linkage disequilibrium occurs more frequently when positive selection has acted on the population rather than under various neutral models. Thus, detecting such patterns could accurately reveal targets of positive selection along a recombining chromosome or a genome. Calculating linkage disequilibria in whole genomes is computationally expensive because allele correlations need to be evaluated for millions of pairs of sites. To analyze large datasets efficiently, algorithmic implementations used in modern population genetics need to exploit multiple cores of current workstations in a scalable way. However, population genomic datasets come in various types and shapes while typically showing SNP density heterogeneity, which makes the implementation of generally scalable parallel algorithms a challenging task.FINDINGS: Here we present a series of four parallelization strategies targeting shared-memory systems for the computationally intensive problem of detecting genomic regions that have contributed to the past adaptation of the species, also referred to as regions that have undergone a selective sweep, based on linkage disequilibrium patterns. We provide a thorough performance evaluation of the proposed parallel algorithms for computing linkage disequilibrium, and outline the benefits of each approach. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of our open-source sweep-detection software OmegaPlus, which implements all four parallelization strategies presented here, with a variety of neutrality tests.CONCLUSIONS: The computational demands of selective sweep detection algorithms depend greatly on the SNP density heterogeneity and the data representation. Choosing the right parallel algorithm for the analysis can lead to significant processing time reduction and major energy savings. However, determining which parallel algorithm will execute more efficiently on a specific processor architecture and number of available cores for a particular dataset is not straightforward."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons among four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, and OmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times.

The frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use combinations of statistics, maximum likelihood, machine learning etc. In this survey, we present and discuss summary statistics and software tools, and classify them based on the selective sweep signature they detect, i.e., SFS-based vs. LD-based, as well as their capacity to analyze whole genomes or just subgenomic regions. Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons among four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, and OmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times. In equilibrium neutral models or mild bottlenecks, both SFS- and LD-based methods are able to detect selective sweeps accurately. Methods and tools that rely on LD exhibit higher true positive rates than SFS-based ones under the model of a single sweep or recurrent hitchhiking. However, their false positive rate is elevated when a misspecified demographic model is used to represent the null hypothesis. When the correct (or similar to the correct) demographic model is used instead, the false positive rates are considerably reduced. The accuracy of detecting the true target of selection is decreased in bottleneck scenarios. In terms of execution time, LD-based methods are typically faster than SFS-based methods, due to the nature of required arithmetic."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"We present RAiSD (Raised Accuracy in Sweep Detection), an open-source software that implements a novel, to our knowledge, and parameter-free detection mechanism that relies on multiple signatures of a selective sweep via the enumeration of SNP vectors.","answer_start":254}],"question":"Which software are used for the detection of selective sweeps?","id":"5cd96eb2a49efeb44c000003_010","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Selective sweeps leave distinct signatures locally in genomes, enabling the detection of loci that have undergone recent positive selection.

ADS-5102 is a high-dose, ER formulation of amantadine, administered orally once daily at bedtime, that achieves high plasma drug concentrations throughout the day.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we present pooled results from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III ADS-5102 trials.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The two studies in PD patients with dyskinesia shared design and eligibility criteria, differing only in treatment duration. Results from common assessment time points were pooled.RESULTS: At 12 weeks, the least squares (LS) mean change in total score on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale among 100 patients randomized to ADS-5102 and 96 patients randomized to placebo was - 17.7 (standard error [SE] 1.3) vs. - 7.6 (1.3) points, respectively (- 10.1 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 13.8, - 6.5; p < 0.0001). The relative treatment difference between groups was 27.3% (p < 0.0001). At 12 weeks, the LS mean change in OFF time was - 0.59 (0.21) vs. +0.41 (0.20) h/day, a difference of - 1.00 h/day (95% CI - 1.57, - 0.44; p = 0.0006). For both efficacy measures, a significant difference from placebo was attained by two weeks, the first post-baseline assessment, and was maintained throughout 12 weeks. In the pooled ADS-5102 group, the most common adverse events were hallucination, dizziness, dry mouth, peripheral edema, constipation, falls, and orthostatic hypotension.CONCLUSIONS: These analyses provide further evidence supporting ADS-5102 as an adjunct to levodopa for treating both dyskinesia and OFF time in PD patients with dyskinesia.

Subjects received either two injections of MVA (MM group) or one injection of Placebo and one injection of MVA (PM group) four weeks apart. Safety was evaluated by assessment of adverse events (AE), focused physical exams, electrocardiogram recordings and safety laboratories. Solicited AEs consisted of a set of pre-defined expected local reactions (erythema, swelling, pain, pruritus, and induration) and systemic symptoms (body temperature, headache, myalgia, nausea and fatigue) and were recorded on a memory aid for an 8-day period following each injection. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was evaluated in terms of humoral immune responses measured with a vaccinia-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) before and at different time points after vaccination.RESULTS: Vaccinations were well tolerated by all subjects. No serious adverse event related to MVA and no case of myopericarditis was reported. The overall incidence of unsolicited AEs was similar in both groups.

An 87-bp segment (87MBR) immediately 3' to breakpoint cluster 3 was essential for DNA-protein interaction monitored with mobility shift assays.

SATB1 expression profiles were evaluated in well-differentiated NPC cell line CNE1, poorly-differentiated CNE2Z, undifferentiated C666-1 and immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelia NP-69 cells using quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting and fluorescent staining.

In this article, we comprehensively analyze the cellular and molecular role of SATB1 in CRC cell lines with different SATB1 expression levels by using RNAi-mediated knockdown. Using siRNAs with different knockdown efficacies, we demonstrate antiproliferative, cell cycle-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of SATB1 knockdown in a SATB1 gene dose-dependent manner. Tumor growth inhibition is confirmed in vivo in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model using stable knockdown cells. The in-depth analysis of cellular effects reveals increased activities of caspases-3, -7, -8, -9 and other mediators of apoptotic pathways. Similarly, the analysis of E- and N-cadherin, slug, twist, β-catenin and MMP7 indicates SATB1 effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and matrix breakdown. Our results also establish SATB1 effects on receptor tyrosine kinases and (proto-)oncogenes such as HER receptors and Pim-1.

We also describe a new labeling feature that presents additional efficacy data to clinicians.DATA SOURCES: Data sets for all relevant clinical trials of pimavanserin and the Applicant's and FDA's analyses of these data were considered in this review. Data were available from 616 patients with Parkinson's disease with hallucinations and delusions who received at least 1 dose of pimavanserin, with a total exposure of 825 patient-years in the Parkinson's disease psychosis population.RESULTS: Pimavanserin 34 mg/d was effective in treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease.

We describe the regulatory and clinical issues important to the FDA's approval of this New Drug Application, with special focus on the risk-benefit balance. We also describe a new labeling feature that presents additional efficacy data to clinicians.DATA SOURCES: Data sets for all relevant clinical trials of pimavanserin and the Applicant's and FDA's analyses of these data were considered in this review. Data were available from 616 patients with Parkinson's disease with hallucinations and delusions who received at least 1 dose of pimavanserin, with a total exposure of 825 patient-years in the Parkinson's disease psychosis population.RESULTS: Pimavanserin 34 mg/d was effective in treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease. In the Applicant's single pivotal trial, 80.5% of pimavanserin patients experienced at least some improvement in symptoms compared to 58.1% of patients taking placebo. Pimavanserin did not worsen motor function, an adverse effect commonly observed with other antipsychotics, probably because of a lack of consequential dopamine binding.CONCLUSIONS: Pimavanserin is the only FDA-approved treatment for the hallucinations and delusions seen in patients with psychosis of Parkinson's disease.

The most known genes in these islands are cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene (VacA). Most studies demonstrated various frequency of CagA and VacA in patient with peptic ulcer or gastritis in different countries. This variation in CagA and VacA frequency may be due to the capability of this bacterium to be genetically versatile and can alter the expression of these genes with geographic diversity. Although H. pylori infection is not usually associated with any clinical symptoms, but sometimes leads to inflammation in gastrointestinal system and resulted in peptic ulcer and gastric cancer.

Spiral-shaped H. pylori undergo morphologic conversion to a viable but not culturable coccoid form when they transit from the microaerobic stomach into the anaerobic intestinal tract. However, little is known about the morphological and pathogenic characteristics of H. pylori under prolonged anaerobic conditions. In this study, scanning electron microscopy was used to document anaerobiosis-induced morphological changes of H. pylori, from helical to coccoid to a newly defined fragmented form. Western blot analysis indicated that all three forms express certain pathogenic proteins, including the bacterial cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), components of the cag-Type IV secretion system (TFSS), the blood group antigen-binding adhesin BabA, and UreA (an apoenzyme of urease), almost equally. Similar urease activities were also detected in all three forms of H. pylori. However, in contrast to the helical form, bacterial motility and TFSS activity were found to have been abrogated in the anaerobiosis-induced coccoid and fragmented forms of H. pylori. Notably, it was demonstrated that some of the anaerobiosis-induced fragmented state cells could be converted to proliferation-competent helical bacteria in vitro.

CagY is an ortholog of VirB10 that, unlike other VirB10 orthologs, has a large middle repeat region (MRR) with extensive repetitive sequence motifs, which undergo CD4+ T cell-dependent recombination during infection of mice. Recombination in the CagY MRR reduces T4SS function, diminishes the host inflammatory response, and enables the bacteria to colonize at a higher density. Since CagY is known to bind human α5β1 integrin, we tested the hypothesis that recombination in the CagY MRR regulates T4SS function by modulating binding to α5β1 integrin. Using a cell-free microfluidic assay, we found that H. pylori binding to α5β1 integrin under shear flow is dependent on the CagY MRR, but independent of the presence of the T4SS pili, which are only formed when H. pylori is in contact with host cells. Similarly, expression of CagY in the absence of other T4SS genes was necessary and sufficient for whole bacterial cell binding to α5β1 integrin. Bacteria with variant cagY alleles that reduced T4SS function showed comparable reduction in binding to α5β1 integrin, although CagY was still expressed on the bacterial surface. We speculate that cagY-dependent modulation of H. pylori T4SS function is mediated by alterations in binding to α5β1 integrin, which in turn regulates the host inflammatory response so as to maximize persistent infection.IMPORTANCE Infection with H. pylori can cause peptic ulcers and is the most important risk factor for gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The major H. pylori virulence factor that determines whether infection causes disease or asymptomatic colonization is the type IV secretion system (T4SS), a sort of molecular syringe that injects bacterial products into gastric epithelial cells and alters host cell physiology. We previously showed that recombination in CagY, an essential T4SS component, modulates the function of the T4SS. Here we found that these recombination events produce parallel changes in specific binding to α5β1 integrin, a host cell receptor that is essential for T4SS-dependent translocation of bacterial effectors. We propose that CagY-dependent binding to α5β1 integrin acts like a molecular rheostat that alters T4SS function and modulates the host immune response to promote persistent infection."}]},{"title":"list","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Only two radioprotective compounds, amifostine and palifermin, currently have the US FDA approval for use in radiation therapy.","answer_start":0}],"question":"List approved radioprotective compounds","id":"5e5cbf4e1af46fc130000004_001","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Only two radioprotective compounds, amifostine and palifermin, currently have the US FDA approval for use in radiation therapy.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and, subsequently, the effect of metformin in regressing angiotensin II (Ang-II)-mediated atheromatous plaque formation in ApoE(-/-) mice. AMPK activity was dose and time dependently downregulated during phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, which was accompanied by an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production. Of note, AMPK activators metformin and AICAR significantly attenuated PMA-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and proinflammatory cytokine production. However, inhibition of AMPK activity alone by compound C was ineffective in promoting monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation in the absence of PMA. On the other hand, inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity inhibited PMA-induced inflammation but not differentiation, suggesting that inflammation and differentiation are independent events. In contrast, inhibition of STAT3 activity inhibited both inflammation and monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. By decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation, metformin and AICAR through increased AMPK activation caused inhibition of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Metformin attenuated Ang-II-induced atheromatous plaque formation and aortic aneurysm in ApoE(-/-) mice partly by reducing monocyte infiltration. We conclude that the AMPK-STAT3 axis plays a pivotal role in regulating monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and that by decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation through increased AMPK activity, AMPK activators inhibit monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, was reported to possess anti-atherosclerotic effects.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and its inhibition restores the insulin resistance. This study investigated the antitumor effect of metformin on endometrial cancer with a focus on PP2A.METHODS: Metformin (1,500-2,250 mg/day) was preoperatively administered to patients with endometrial cancer for 4 to 6 weeks. Expression of the PP2A regulatory subunits, 4 (PPP2R4) and B (PP2A-B), was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using paired specimens obtained before and after metformin treatment. The effect of PPP2R4 inhibition with small interfering RNA was evaluated in the endometrial cancer cell lines HEC265 and HEC1B. P values of < .05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTS: Preoperative metformin treatment significantly reduced the expression of PP2A-B, as determined using IHC, and the mRNA expression of PPP2R4, as determined using RT-PCR, in the patients with endometrial cancer. However, metformin could not directly alter the PPP2R4 mRNA levels in the endometrial cancer cell lines in vitro. PPP2R4 knockdown reduced the proliferation and induced the apoptosis by activating caspases 3/7 in HEC265 and HEC1B cells.CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of the PP2A-B subunit, including PPP2R4, is an important indirect target of metformin.

In patients with WG, high expression of PR3 on the surface of nonprimed neutrophils is associated with an increased incidence and rate of relapse. In this study, we analyzed the functional significance of constitutive PR3 expression for neutrophil activation as induced by anti-PR3 antibody. Therefore, primed and nonprimed neutrophils were stimulated with the monoclonal anti-PR3 antibody PR3G-3. Activation was measured as actin polymerization by the phalloidin assay as an early, detectable activation event and oxidative burst by the dihydrorhodamine assay, as a late, detectable activation event. In contrast to the oxidative burst, we found that anti-PR3 antibody-induced actin polymerization could be triggered in neutrophils without priming with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In addition, a correlation was found between the level of PR3 expression on the surface of these nonprimed neutrophils and the degree of actin polymerization. However, after priming with TNF-alpha, no correlation was found between membrane expression of PR3 and the level of actin polymerization or respiratory burst as induced by anti-PR3 antibody. These data suggest that the presence of PR3 on the surface of nonprimed neutrophils has consequences for their susceptibility to the initial activation step by anti-PR3 antibodies.

Recent studies have shown that membrane-bound PR3 (mPR3) is differentially expressed and colocalizes with CD177/NB1 on circulating neutrophils. We undertook this study to assess the differential expression of CD177 on neutrophils from patients with ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis (ASV) in comparison with patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and healthy individuals, and to investigate whether colocalization of mPR3 and CD177 affects anti-PR3-mediated neutrophil activation.METHODS: Expression of CD177 and mPR3 was analyzed by flow cytometry on isolated neutrophils from patients with ASV (n=53), those with SLE (n=30), those with RA (n=26), and healthy controls (n=31). Neutrophil activation mediated by anti-PR3 antibodies was assessed by measuring the oxidative burst with a dihydrorhodamine assay.RESULTS: Percentages of CD177-expressing neutrophils were significantly higher in patients with ASV and those with SLE than in healthy controls. In 3 healthy donors, CD177 expression was not detected. After priming with tumor necrosis factor alpha, neutrophils remained negative for CD177 while mPR3 expression was induced. Neutrophils from CD177-negative donors or CD177- neutrophils sorted from donors with bimodal expression were susceptible to anti-PR3-mediated oxidative burst. Variation in the extent of anti-PR3-mediated neutrophil activation among different donors occurred independent of the percentage of CD177-expressing neutrophils.CONCLUSION: Membrane expression of CD177 on circulating neutrophils is increased in patients with ASV and in those with SLE, but not in RA patients. However, primed neutrophils from CD177-negative individuals also express mPR3 and are susceptible to anti-PR3-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting that recruitment of CD177-independent mPR3 is involved in anti-PR3-induced neutrophil activation."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The dihydrorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometry assay is a useful diagnostic tool for CGD that can detect absent or reduced NADPH oxidase activity in stimulated phagocytes.","answer_start":473}],"question":"What is the purpose of the 123 dihydrorhodamine assay?","id":"5d387aa8a1e159510500000f_003","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare genetic disease, which is caused by defects in the NADPH oxidase complex (gp91(phox), p22(phox), p40(phox), p47(phox), and p67(phox)) of phagocytes.

We have previously reported that PDT induces apoptotic cell death in glioma cells when the photosensitizer talaporfin sodium (NPe6) is used. Here, we investigated the combined effect of NPe6-PDT with temozolomide, a DNA-alkylating drug used in glioma therapy.METHODS: Human glioblastoma T98G cells and human glioma U251 cells were used as glioma cells. Cell viability was evaluated by WST-8 assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by measurement of caspase-3 activity and DNA-fragmentation. Intracellular reactive oxygen species were evaluated by dihydrorhodamine assay.RESULTS: While the degree of NPe6-PDT induced cell death unchanged in T98G and U251 cells when temozolomide treatment was adjuvant, it was dose-dependently increased by concomitant treatment with temozolomide. Further, concomitantly administered temozolomide dose-dependently increased caspase-3 activity and DNA-fragmentation, while adjuvant-temozolomide did not. These results are suggesting that concomitantly administered temozolomide potentiates the effect of NPe6-PDT to facilitate apoptotic cell death. Additionally, concomitantly administered temozolomide increased intracellular NPe6-fluorescence and reactive oxygen species, suggesting that the augmentation effect of combined treatment may be due to increased intracellular accumulation of NPe6.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that concomitant treatment with NPe6-PDT and temozolomide is a potentially useful therapy for glioma.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is inherited in either X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive pattern. Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus species are the most common organisms reported. Infections with Burkholderia, Serratia, and Nocardia warrant a screen for CGD. Suppurative lymphadenitis, cutaneous abscesses, pneumonia and diarrhea constitute the most common problems in children with CGD. A small percentage of children develop autoimmune manifestations (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, colitis, autoimmune hepatitis) and warrant immunosuppression. X-linked carriers of CGD are at an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases. Nitroblue-tetrazolium dye reduction test and dihydro-rhodamine assay by flow cytometry are the screening tests for this disorder.

We also describe a new labeling feature that presents additional efficacy data to clinicians.DATA SOURCES: Data sets for all relevant clinical trials of pimavanserin and the Applicant's and FDA's analyses of these data were considered in this review. Data were available from 616 patients with Parkinson's disease with hallucinations and delusions who received at least 1 dose of pimavanserin, with a total exposure of 825 patient-years in the Parkinson's disease psychosis population.RESULTS: Pimavanserin 34 mg/d was effective in treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease.

Formation of chromatin generally limits accessibility of specific DNA sequences and inhibits progression of polymerases as they copy information from the DNA. The processes that select sites for initiating either transcription or replication are therefore strongly influenced by factors that modulate the properties of chromatin proteins. Further, in order to elongate their products, both DNA and RNA polymerases must be able to overcome the inhibition presented by chromatin (Lipford and Bell 2001; Workman and Kingston 1998). One way to adjust the properties of chromatin proteins is to covalently modify them by adding or removing chemical moieties. Both histone and non-histone chromatin proteins are altered by acetylation, methylation, and other changes, and the 'nucleosome modifying' complexes that perform these reactions are important components of pathways of transcriptional regulation (Cote 2002; Orphanides and Reinberg 2000; Roth et al. 2001; Strahl and Allis 2000; Workman and Kingston 1998). Another way to alter the effects of nucleosomes is to change the position of the histone octamers relative to specific DNA sequences (Orphanides and Reinberg 2000; Verrijzer 2002; Wang 2002; Workman and Kingston 1998). Since the ability of a sequence to be bound by specific proteins can vary significantly whether the sequence is in the linkers between nucleosomes or at various positions within a nucleosome, 'nucleosome remodeling' complexes that rearrange nucleosome positioning are also important regulators of transcription. Since the DNA replication machinery has to encounter many of the same challenges posed by chromatin, it seems likely that modifying and remodeling complexes also act during duplication of the genome, but most of the current information on these factors relates to regulation of transcription. This chapter describes the factor known variously as FACT in humans, where it promotes elongation of RNA polymerase II on nucleosomal templates in vitro (Orphanides et al. 1998, 1999), DUF in frogs, where it is needed for DNA replication in oocyte extracts (Okuhara et al. 1999), and CP or SPN in yeast, where it is linked in vivo to both transcription and replication (Brewster et al. 2001; Formosa et al. 2001). Like the nucleosome modifying and remodeling complexes, it is broadly conserved among eukaryotes, affects a wide range of processes that utilize chromatin, and directly alters the properties of nucleosomes. However, it does not have nucleosome modifying or standard ATP-dependent remodeling activity, and therefore represents a third class of chromatin modulating factors. It is also presently unique in the extensive connections it displays with both transcription and replication: FACT/DUF/CP/SPN appears to modify nucleosomes in a way that is directly important for the efficient functioning of both RNA polymerases and DNA polymerases. While less is known about the mechanisms it uses to promote its functions than for other factors that affect chromatin, it is clearly an essential part of the complex mixture of activities that modulate access to DNA within chromatin. Physical and genetic interactions suggest that FACT/DUF/CP/SPN affects multiple pathways within replication and transcription as a member of several distinct complexes. Some of the interactions are easy to assimilate into models for replication or transcription, such as direct binding to DNA polymerase alpha (Wittmeyer and Formosa 1997; Wittmeyer et al. 1999), association with nucleosome modifying complexes (John et al. 2000), and interaction with factors that participate in elongation of RNA Polymerase II (Gavin et al. 2002; Squazzo et al. 2002). Others are more surprising such as an association with the 19S complex that regulates the function of the 20S proteasome (Ferdous et al. 2001; Xu et al. 1995), and the indication that FACT/DUF/CP/SPN can act as a specificity factor for casein kinase II (Keller et al. 2001). This chapter reviews the varied approaches that have each revealed different aspects of the function of FACT/DUF/CP/SPN, and presents a picture of a factor that can both alter nucleosomes and orchestrate the assembly or activity of a broad range of complexes that act upon chromatin."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":" We suggest a three-step model in which nucleosome remodelers, general transcription factors, and the transcriptional elongation machinery are primarily involved in generating the nucleosome positioning pattern in vivo.","answer_start":847}],"question":"How is transcriptional elongation affected by nucleosome positioning?","id":"5d3883a0a1e1595105000017_008","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Although the genomic pattern of nucleosome positioning is broadly conserved, quantitative aspects vary over evolutionary timescales.

TFIIS acts in the chromatin context, but its contribution to the chromatin landscape has not yet been investigated. Co-transcriptional chromatin alterations include subtle changes in nucleosome positioning, like those expected to be elicited by TFIIS, which are elusive to detect. The most popular method to map nucleosomes involves intensive chromatin digestion by micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Maps based on these exhaustively digested samples miss any MNase-sensitive nucleosomes caused by transcription. In contrast, partial digestion approaches preserve such nucleosomes, but introduce noise due to MNase sequence preferences. A systematic way of correcting this bias for massively parallel sequencing experiments is still missing.RESULTS: To investigate the contribution of TFIIS to the chromatin landscape, we developed a refined nucleosome-mapping method in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on partial MNase digestion and a sequence-bias correction derived from naked DNA cleavage, the refined method efficiently mapped nucleosomes in promoter regions rich in MNase-sensitive structures. The naked DNA correction was also important for mapping gene body nucleosomes, particularly in those genes whose core promoters contain a canonical TATA element. With this improved method, we analyzed the global nucleosomal changes caused by lack of TFIIS. We detected a general increase in nucleosomal fuzziness and more restricted changes in nucleosome occupancy, which concentrated in some gene categories. The TATA-containing genes were preferentially associated with decreased occupancy in gene bodies, whereas the TATA-like genes did so with increased fuzziness. The detected chromatin alterations correlated with functional defects in nascent transcription, as revealed by genomic run-on experiments.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of partial MNase digestion and naked DNA correction of the sequence bias is a precise nucleosomal mapping method that does not exclude MNase-sensitive nucleosomes. This method is useful for detecting subtle alterations in nucleosome positioning produced by lack of TFIIS. Their analysis revealed that TFIIS generally contributed to nucleosome positioning in both gene promoters and bodies. The independent effect of lack of TFIIS on nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness supports the existence of alternative chromatin dynamics during transcription elongation."}]},{"title":"yesno","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with hereditary predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer.

Moreover, immunomodulatory drugs Lenalidomide and Pomalidomide, indirectly inhibited MAIT cell activation. We further show that cell lines can be pulsed with vitamin-B derivative Ags and that these can be presented via MR1 to MAIT cells in vitro, to induce cytotoxic activity comparable to that of natural killer (NK) cells. Thus, MAIT cells are reduced in MM patients, which may contribute to disease in these individuals, and moreover, MAIT cells may represent new immunotherapeutic targets for treatment of MM and other malignancies."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"We describe recent observations with regard to functional exhaustion of iNKT and MAIT cells in MM pathology and discuss the potential application of checkpoint inhibition as an attractive target for prolonged activation of these immunomodulatory T cells in the treatment of MM.","answer_start":1141}],"question":"Do MAIT cells have a role in multiple myeloma?","id":"5e2e1d6afbd6abf43b000026_004","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a progressive monoclonal B cell malignancy, for which survival and progression largely relies on the crosstalk of tumor cells with the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, inducing immune escape, angiogenesis, bone destruction and drug resistance. Despite great therapeutic advances, most of the MM patients still relapse and remain incurable. Over the past years, immunotherapy has emerged as a new field in cancer therapy. Here, the immune cells of the patients themselves are activated to target the tumor cells. In MM, several effector cells of the immune system are present in the BM microenvironment; unfortunately, they are mostly all functionally impaired. In this review, we focus on the role of innate-like T cells in MM, particularly CD1d- and MR1- restricted T cells such as respectively invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. These cells have the capacity upon activation to rapidly release copious amounts of cytokines affecting a wide range of innate and adaptive immune responses, and could therefore play a key protective role in anti-tumor immunity. We describe recent observations with regard to functional exhaustion of iNKT and MAIT cells in MM pathology and discuss the potential application of checkpoint inhibition as an attractive target for prolonged activation of these immunomodulatory T cells in the treatment of MM."}]},{"title":"list","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The known serious side effects of radiation therapy on the head or central nervous system are uncommon and include radiation necrosis, microangiopathy, and progressive leukencephalopathy.

Radiation damage can be transient or persistent.OBJECTIVE: This article gives an overview of the most important signs of radiation-induced radiogenic alterations to tissue in various organ systems.FINDINGS: Frequent radiation-induced tissue alterations found by imaging are pneumonitis, disturbance of the blood-brain barrier, radionecrosis of brain tissue, radiogenic liver damage, mucositis, colitis, osteitis, osteoradionecrosis and myositis. The combination with systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy can increase the severity of radiogenic reactions of normal tissue.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AFTERCARE: The most important differential diagnosis for radiogenic alterations to normal tissue is post-therapeutic tumor recurrence. Besides typical latency periods, location and matching with the radiation field are important differentiation criteria, depending on the tumor biology and the radiation technique. The follow-up schedule should follow the current guidelines and the clinical condition of the patient should be additionally considered.

The grades of fibrosis vary between mild to severe depending on individual radiosensitivity. In this study, we have investigated the molecular pathways that influence RIF and have correlated data from immunohistochemistry (IHC) for von -Willebrand Factor (vWF) and from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) concerning markers such as Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β 1, and vWF, with clinical data concerning the occurrence of WHD during follow-up.METHODS: Expression profiles of the genes encoding TGF-β 1, vWF, and α-procollagen (PC) were analyzed, by RT-PCR, in specimens from patients with (n = 20; 25.6 %) and without (n = 58; 74.4 %) a history of previous RT to the head and neck. Moreover, IHC against vWF was performed. Clinical data on the occurrence of cervical WHDs were analyzed and correlated.RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in the expression profiles of α-PC and TGF-β 1 was observed in previously irradiated skin samples (occurrence of RT >91 days preoperatively). vWF showed a statistically significant increase in non-irradiated tissue. Moreover, analysis of expression profiles in patients with and without WHDs during follow-up was performed. IHC showed a reduced amount of vessels and structural changes in epidermal tissue post-RT.CONCLUSIONS: The expression of markers of fibrosis and angiogenesis was analyzed in order to gain insight into molecular pathways that account for structural changes in irradiated skin and that eventually lead to WHDs. The results are congruent with reports from the literature and are a possible starting point for further research, as anti-TGF-β 1 treatment, for example, could represent new therapeutic opportunities in the management of previously irradiated patients."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Acute skin reactions are one of the most common side effects of radiation therapy,","answer_start":143}],"question":"List side effects of radiation therapy?","id":"5e46f9683f54159529000010_006","is_impossible":false}],"context":"BACKGROUND: Breast neoplasms are the second most common type of cancer worldwide, and radiation therapy is a key component of their treatment. Acute skin reactions are one of the most common side effects of radiation therapy, and prevention of this adverse event has been investigated in several studies. However, a clinically applicable, preventative treatment remains unavailable. It has been demonstrated that application of a low-power laser can promote tissue repair. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an indium gallium aluminum phosphorus (InGaAIP) laser operated at 660 nm in preventing radiodermatitis in women undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial. A total of 52 patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer (stages I to III) will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group to receive laser therapy (n = 26) or a control group to receive a placebo (n = 26). The laser or placebo will be applied five days a week, immediately before each radiotherapy session. Skin reactions will then be graded weekly by a nurse, a radiotherapist, and an oncologist (all of whom will be blinded) using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) developed by the National Cancer Institute and the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria developed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Patients will also answer a modified visual analogue scale for pain (a self-evaluation questionnaire). Primary and secondary outcomes will be the prevention of radiodermatitis and pain secondary to radiodermatitis, respectively.DISCUSSION: The ideal tool for preventing radiodermatitis is an agent that mediates DNA repair or promotes cell proliferation. Application of a low-power laser has been shown to promote tissue repair by reducing inflammation and inducing collagen synthesis. Moreover, this treatment approach has not been associated with adverse events and is cost-effective. Thus, the results of this ongoing trial may establish whether use of a low-power laser represents an ideal treatment option for the prevention of radiodermatitis.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02003599.

While less selective JAK inhibitors have shown long-term efficacy in treating inflammatory conditions, this was accompanied by dose-limiting side effects. Here, we describe the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib and its active metabolite in healthy volunteers and the use of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation to support dose selection for phase IIB in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.METHODS: Two trials were conducted in healthy male volunteers. In the first trial, filgotinib was administered as single doses from 10 mg up to multiple daily doses of 200 mg. In the second trial, daily doses of 300 and 450 mg for 10 days were evaluated. Non-compartmental analysis was used to determine individual pharmacokinetic parameters for filgotinib and its metabolite. The overall pharmacodynamic activity for the two moieties was assessed in whole blood using interleukin-6-induced phosphorylation of signal-transducer and activator of transcription 1 as a biomarker for JAK1 activity. These data were used to conduct non-linear mixed-effects modeling to investigate a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship.RESULTS: Modeling and simulation on the basis of early clinical data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib are dose proportional up to 200 mg, in agreement with observed data, and support that both filgotinib and its metabolite contribute to its pharmacodynamic effects. Simulation of biomarker response supports that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect is reached at a daily dose of 200 mg filgotinib.CONCLUSION: Based on these results, a daily dose range up to 200 mg has been selected for phase IIB dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01179581 NCT01384422 NCT01419990."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor filgotinib (GLPG0634), which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease, demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy profiles in RA patients after 4 weeks of daily dosing.

We undertook this study to test our hypothesis that selective inhibition of JAK-1 would combine good efficacy with a better safety profile compared with less selective JAK inhibitors.METHODS: In two 4-week exploratory, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa trials, 127 RA patients with an insufficient response to methotrexate (MTX) received filgotinib (GLPG0634, GS-6034) oral capsules (100 mg twice daily or 30, 75, 150, 200, or 300 mg once daily) or placebo, added onto a stable regimen of MTX, to evaluate safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of filgotinib. The primary efficacy end point was the number and percentage of patients in each treatment group meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) at week 4.RESULTS: Treatment with filgotinib at 75-300 mg met the primary end point and showed early onset of efficacy. ACR20 response rates progressively increased to week 4, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein (CRP) level decreased. Marked and sustained improvements were observed in serum CRP level and other PD markers. The PK of filgotinib and its major metabolite was dose proportional over the 30-300 mg range. Early side effects seen with other less selective JAK inhibitors were not observed (e.g., there was no worsening of anemia [JAK-2 inhibition related], no effects on liver transaminases, and no increase in low-density lipoprotein or total cholesterol). A limited decrease in neutrophils without neutropenia was consistent with immunomodulatory effects through JAK-1 inhibition. There were no infections. Overall, filgotinib was well tolerated. Events related to study drug were mild or moderate and transient during therapy, and the most common such event was nausea.CONCLUSION: Selective inhibition of JAK-1 with filgotinib shows initial efficacy in RA with an encouraging safety profile in these exploratory studies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01384422 NCT01668641.© 2017 The Authors.

The impact of RI was investigated in three groups of subjects with mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 6) and severe (n = 3) RI [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60-89, 30-59 and 15-29 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 , respectively] and a control group (n = 9) with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ).

Primers and probes that target the conserved spike S2 region of human SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and their related bat CoVs were designed. The results of real-time RT-PCR showed specific reactions for each virus with adequate detection limits of 50-100 copies/mL and 5-100 copies/mL using pUC57-SARS-pS2 (a template for SARS-CoV) and pGEM-MERS-S2 (a template for MERS-CoV), respectively. In addition, this real-time RT-PCR system was able to detect the target viruses SARS-like bat CoV and MERS-CoV in bat fecal samples and sputum of MERS patients, respectively.

This paper explores how, and to what extent, New Zealand adolescents are typically using and exposed to active cellphones and cordless phones, and considers implications of this in relation to brain tumour risk, with reference to current research findings.METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 373 Year 7 and 8 school students with a mean age of 12.3 years (range 10.3-13.7 years) from the Wellington region of New Zealand. Participants completed a questionnaire and measured their normal body-to-phone texting distances. Main exposure-metrics included self-reported time spent with an active cellphone close to the body, estimated time and number of calls on both phone types, estimated and actual extent of SMS text-messaging, cellphone functions used and people texted. Statistical analyses used Pearson Chi2 tests and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Analyses were undertaken using SPSS version 19.0.RESULTS: Both cellphones and cordless phones were used by approximately 90% of students. A third of participants had already used a cordless phone for ≥ 7 years. In 4 years from the survey to mid-2013, the cordless phone use of 6% of participants would equal that of the highest Interphone decile (≥ 1640 hours), at the surveyed rate of use. High cellphone use was related to cellphone location at night, being woken regularly, and being tired at school.

This type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of ETV for treatment of patients with iNPH compared to conservative therapy, or shunting of CSF using VP or VA shunts.To assess the perioperative and postoperative complication rates in patients with iNPH after ETV compared to conservative therapy, VP or VA shunting.SEARCH METHODS: We searched for eligible studies using ALOIS: a comprehensive register of dementia studies, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and several bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME).We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) to identify potentially relevant reviews. The search strategy was adapted for other databases, using the most appropriate controlled vocabulary for each. We did not apply any language or time restrictions. The searches were performed in August 2014.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ETV treatment of iNPH. Patients had to have at least two symptoms of the Hakim-Adams triad. Exclusion criteria were obstructive causes of hydrocephalus, other significant intracranial pathology and other confirmed causes of dementia. The eligible comparators were conservative treatment or shunting using VP and VA shunts.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened search results, selected eligible studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for additional data.MAIN RESULTS: Only one study met the inclusion criteria: an RCT comparing effectiveness of ETV and non-programmable VP shunts in 42 patients with iNPH. The study was conducted in Brazil between 2009 and 2012. The overall study risk of bias was high. The primary outcome in the study was the proportion of patients with improved symptoms one year after surgery, determined as a change of at least two points on the Japanese NPH scale. Due to imprecision in the results, it was not possible to determine whether there was any difference between groups in the proportion of patients who improved 3 or 12 months after surgery (3 months: odds ration (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.76, n = 42; 12 months: OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.62 to 10.11, n = 38). We were unable to estimate the effect of treatment on other efficacy outcomes (cognition, balance, function, gait and mobility) because they were inadequately reported. Of the 26 patients in the VP shunting group, 5 developed subdural hematoma postoperatively, while there were no complications among the 16 patients in the ETV group (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.3, n = 42), but the estimate was too imprecise to determine whether this was likely to reflect a true difference in complication rates. This was also the case for rates of further surgical intervention (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.31 to 6.24, n = 42). There were no deaths during the trial. We judged the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be very low because of a high risk of selection, attrition and reporting bias and serious imprecision in the results.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The only randomised trial of ETV for iNPH compares it to an intervention which is not a standard practice (VP shunting using a non-programmable valve). The evidence from this study is inconclusive and of very low quality. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the evidence. There is a need for more robust research on this topic to be able to determine the effectiveness of ETV in patients with iNPH."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The definition of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), in adults, associates clinical signs (Adams and Hakim triad) involving gait disorders, urinary incontinence and dementia, associated with aspects on brain imaging that are consistent with this hypothesis and also normal or slightly increased intracranial pressure.","answer_start":0}],"question":"List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?","id":"5e2f9e0dfbd6abf43b000034_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"The definition of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), in adults, associates clinical signs (Adams and Hakim triad) involving gait disorders, urinary incontinence and dementia, associated with aspects on brain imaging that are consistent with this hypothesis and also normal or slightly increased intracranial pressure.

From the 43 initially sorted, only 13 have been selected using exclusion criteria. The proposed methods are very sparse and focused on the improvement after surgical shunt. This focus is independent from the diagnosis criteria proposed in 2005. This introduces an ambiguity in the interpretation of the results. In practice, the diagnosis of NPH is more difficult in the elderly population where differential diagnoses are frequent, particularly vascular lesions (notably microangiopathy) and Alzheimer's disease. The more invasive techniques as continuous spinal drainage (usually during 3 days) or some features of CSF dynamics (Rout, compliance) seem to be the best predictors of after shunt improvement. However, these techniques are difficult to use in routine in the elderly. The combination of Evans index and corpus callosum angle on MRI is very useful to improve the differential diagnosis with cerebral atrophy. Spinal tap test (lumbar puncture with the removal of 40 mL of CSF) can be repeated two or three times for consecutive days to improve the predictive value before shunting. Gait and balance often improve after shunt, more than cognition and bladder disorders. In the elderly population, the prognosis after 3 years is non conclusive despite initial improvement. Poor prognosis seems to be due to associated pathologies in particular neurodegenerative diseases. This should be considered in decision-making of CSF shunt."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a clinical triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence combined with radiographic findings of ventriculomegaly and laboratory findings of normal cerebrospinal fluid pressures.

However, only a small subset of potentially druggable targets has attracted significant research and development resources. The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project develops resources to catalyze the development of likely targetable, yet currently understudied prospective drug targets. A central component of the IDG program is a comprehensive knowledge resource of the druggable genome.RESULTS: As part of that effort, we have developed a framework to integrate, navigate, and analyze drug discovery data based on formalized and standardized classifications and annotations of druggable protein targets, the Drug Target Ontology (DTO). DTO was constructed by extensive curation and consolidation of various resources. DTO classifies the four major drug target protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors, based on phylogenecity, function, target development level, disease association, tissue expression, chemical ligand and substrate characteristics, and target-family specific characteristics. The formal ontology was built using a new software tool to auto-generate most axioms from a database while supporting manual knowledge acquisition. A modular, hierarchical implementation facilitate ontology development and maintenance and makes use of various external ontologies, thus integrating the DTO into the ecosystem of biomedical ontologies. As a formal OWL-DL ontology, DTO contains asserted and inferred axioms. Modeling data from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target disease relationships.CONCLUSIONS: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene, protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models, drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug discovery.

Nevertheless, the molecular features remain largely unknown.Objective: To investigate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in a large series of peritoneal mesothelioma and characterize the mutational landscape of these tumors.Design, Setting, and Participants: We studied 88 consecutive patients (39 men, 49 women; median age 61, range 17-84 years) with peritoneal mesotheliomas diagnosed at a single institution between 2005 and 2015. We identified ALK-positive mesotheliomas by immunohistochemistry and confirmed ALK rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In ALK-rearranged cases, we characterized the fusion partners using targeted next-generation sequencing of both tumor DNA and RNA. In select cases, we quantified asbestos fibers by combined scanning electron microscopy and x-ray spectroscopy. We also explored ALK rearrangement in a separate series of 205 patients with pleural mesothelioma.Main Outcomes and Measures: Identification and characterization of novel ALK rearrangements and correlations with clinicopathologic characteristics.Results: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase was positive by immunohistochemistry in 11 (13%) peritoneal mesotheliomas (focal weak in 8, diffuse strong in 3). In focal weak ALK-positive cases, no ALK rearrangement was detected by FISH or next-generation sequencing. In strong diffuse ALK-positive cases, FISH confirmed ALK rearrangements, and next-generation sequencing identified novel fusion partners ATG16L1, STRN, and TPM1. Patients with ALK-rearranged peritoneal mesotheliomas were women and younger than patients without ALK rearrangement (median age 36 vs 62; Mann-Whitney test, P = .02), but all other clinicopathologic characteristics (size of tumor nodules, histology, treatment, and survival) were not different. No asbestos fibers were detected in ALK-rearranged cases. Furthermore, loss of chromosomal region 9p or 22q or genetic alterations in BAP1, SETD2, or NF2 typically present in peritoneal mesothelioma were absent in the ALK-rearranged cases. All pleural mesotheliomas were ALK-negative by immunohistochemistry.Conclusions and Relevance: We identified unique ALK rearrangements in a subset of patients with peritoneal mesothelioma, each lacking asbestos fibers, therapeutic radiation, and cytogenetic and molecular alterations typically found in these tumors. Identification of clinically actionable ALK rearrangements may represent a novel pathogenetic mechanism of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma with promise for targeted therapy."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"According to global estimates, at least 107,000 people die each year from asbestos-related lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis resulting from occupational exposure","answer_start":0}],"question":"Is mesothelioma caused by asbestos exposure?","id":"5e31c4adfbd6abf43b00004d_006","is_impossible":false}],"context":"According to global estimates, at least 107,000 people die each year from asbestos-related lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis resulting from occupational exposure.

But only a few researchers focused on their genetic effects and mutagenicity information which is useful in evaluating the carcinogenicity of chemicals. In this study, chrysotile from Mangnai, Qinghai, China, and an artificial substitute, rock wool fiber were prepared as suspensions and were tested at concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml in V79 lung fibroblasts. Chromosome aberrations were detected by micronucleus assay after exposure for 24 h, and DNA damage were estimated by single cell gel electrophoresis after exposure for 12, 24, or 48 h. According to the results, chrysotile and rock wool fibers caused micronuclei to form in a dose-dependent manner in V79 cells; olive tail moment values increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When V79 cells were exposed to a concentration of 200 μg/ml, the degree of DNA damage induced by chrysotile fibers was greater than rock wool fibers.

My topics are etiology, herniosis, diverticulosis coli, and cancer. Hippocrates blamed wear and tear for herniation. Russell's (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) explanation was congenital peritoneal \"buds\" extending down to the pelvis. Harrison (Arch Surg 4:680-689, 1922) attributed herniae to transversalis fascial degradation. Keith (Lancet 2(17):1398-1399, 1906) concluded that pathology was involved, even though Russell (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) had denied it. Nevertheless, the congenital theory prevailed. According to McVay (Christopher's textbook of surgery, W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1960, p. 159), defects arise in normal musculo-aponeurotic structures. Research showed that atrophy was caused by damaged fibroblasts producing less collagen, which was abnormal (having a reduced I/III ratio). The disease was systemic, later named herniosis. Nicotine addiction increased the incidence of herniation by an inflammatory process named metastatic emphysema. In 1948, Saint's Triad, an aggregation of hiatus hernia (later, any primary hernia), gallstones, and diverticulosis coli, was introduced. This association occurred eight times more often than expected, with herniosis appearing to be its cause, abetted by high blood cholesterol causing gallstones. In 2006, Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) provided evidence that colon cancer is accompanied by a reduction in diverticula. Klinge et al. (Hernia 8(4):300-301, 2004) showed that these entities require different extracellular matrices (ECMs). Ghajar and Bissell (Histochem Cell Biol 130:1105-1118, 2008) pointed out that the ECM, which comprises 80% of the breast, influences its epithelial genetic expression, likewise with other organs (kidney, skin, lung, colon, and ovaries). Recently, a fundamental change in our understanding of cancer growth and metastasis has taken place. Whereas the degradation of connective tissue was thought to encourage invasion, eliciting concern for the herniated, now, investigators report the reverse, a reactive vascularized stroma resembling wound healing with an increase in fibroblasts and collagen I. Words such as desmoplasia, fibrosis, and stiffening abound. In conclusion, degradation of the ECM may be why herniosis appears to be hostile to the development of cancer throughout the body. Studies are needed of patients with and without a history of hernia to determine their incidence of cancer. Data from smokers should be separated, since they carry their own high risk of malignancy."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Remarkably, clinical studies of Saint's triad extending over the past 60 years have repeatedly demonstrated a highly significant relationship between colonic diverticula and abdominal herniae.

Wound healing may be affected, leading to recurrences after hernia repair or primary incisional herniation. Women with genitourinary prolapse show signs of herniosis in the pelvis. Diverticulosis coli, commonly seen in the elderly, like hernia, was once attributed to stress and strain from constipation. It is now suspected that herniosis weakens the colonic ECM, allowing the mucosa to form diverticula by herniating alongside the vasa recta. Remarkably, clinical studies of Saint's triad extending over the past 60 years have repeatedly demonstrated a highly significant relationship between colonic diverticula and abdominal herniae. Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) reported that diverticula and cancer are rarely coincident in the colon, despite aging. Their data indicate that the two pathologies arise in different ECMs. Klinge et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 22:515-520, 2007), quoting Paget (Lancet 1:571-573, 1889), \"Tumor cells can like seeds only grow if they fall on congenial soil,\" suggested that certain genes prevent stromal malignancy by influencing the microenvironment to stop epithelia from becoming cancerous. Thus, damage to the colonic ECM from hernial disease is conducive to diverticulosis, but hostile for cancer. Hernial disease being systemic, a similar ECM should be present throughout the body. Coincident diverticulosis and herniae support this hypothesis. Its validation requires further research involving the lifetime risk of cancer in patients with and without hernia.

The NIPBL protein is required for the loading of cohesin onto chromatin, but how and where cohesin is loaded in vertebrate cells is unclear. Heterozygous mutations of NIPBL were found in 50% of the cases of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), a human developmental syndrome with a complex phenotype. However, no defects in the mitotic function of cohesin have been observed so far and the links between NIPBL mutations and the observed developmental defects are unclear. We show that NIPBL binds to chromatin in somatic cells with a different timing than cohesin. Further, we observe that high-affinity NIPBL binding sites localize to different regions than cohesin and almost exclusively to the promoters of active genes. NIPBL or cohesin knockdown reduce transcription of these genes differently, suggesting a cohesin-independent role of NIPBL for transcription. Motif analysis and comparison to published data show that NIPBL co-localizes with a specific set of other transcription factors. In cells derived from CdLS patients NIPBL binding levels are reduced and several of the NIPBL-bound genes have previously been observed to be mis-expressed in CdLS.

It has been proposed that the effects of Nipbl-haploinsufficiency result from disruption of long-range communication between DNA elements. Here we use zebrafish and mouse models of CdLS to examine how transcriptional changes caused by Nipbl deficiency give rise to limb defects, a common condition in individuals with CdLS. In the zebrafish pectoral fin (forelimb), knockdown of Nipbl expression led to size reductions and patterning defects that were preceded by dysregulated expression of key early limb development genes, including fgfs, shha, hand2 and multiple hox genes. In limb buds of Nipbl-haploinsufficient mice, transcriptome analysis revealed many similar gene expression changes, as well as altered expression of additional classes of genes that play roles in limb development. In both species, the pattern of dysregulation of hox-gene expression depended on genomic location within the Hox clusters. In view of studies suggesting that Nipbl colocalizes with the mediator complex, which facilitates enhancer-promoter communication, we also examined zebrafish deficient for the Med12 Mediator subunit, and found they resembled Nipbl-deficient fish in both morphology and gene expression. Moreover, combined partial reduction of both Nipbl and Med12 had a strongly synergistic effect, consistent with both molecules acting in a common pathway. In addition, three-dimensional fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that Nipbl and Med12 are required to bring regions containing long-range enhancers into close proximity with the zebrafish hoxda cluster.

However, it is possible that the stimulation of cohesin's ATPase by Scc2 also has a post-loading function, for example driving loop extrusion. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single-molecule tracking in human cells, we show that Scc2 binds dynamically to chromatin, principally through an association with cohesin. Scc2's movement within chromatin is consistent with a 'stop-and-go' or 'hopping' motion.

NIPBL loads cohesin onto chromatin. Cohesin mediates sister chromatid cohesion important for mitosis but is also increasingly recognized as a regulator of gene expression. In CdLS patient cells and animal models, expression changes of multiple genes with little or no sister chromatid cohesion defect suggests that disruption of gene regulation underlies this disorder. However, the effect of NIPBL haploinsufficiency on cohesin binding, and how this relates to the clinical presentation of CdLS, has not been fully investigated. Nipbl haploinsufficiency causes CdLS-like phenotype in mice. We examined genome-wide cohesin binding and its relationship to gene expression using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Nipbl+/- mice that recapitulate the CdLS phenotype.RESULTS: We found a global decrease in cohesin binding, including at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites and repeat regions. Cohesin-bound genes were found to be enriched for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at their promoters; were disproportionately downregulated in Nipbl mutant MEFs; and displayed evidence of reduced promoter-enhancer interaction. The results suggest that gene activation is the primary cohesin function sensitive to Nipbl reduction. Over 50% of significantly dysregulated transcripts in mutant MEFs come from cohesin target genes, including genes involved in adipogenesis that have been implicated in contributing to the CdLS phenotype.CONCLUSIONS: Decreased cohesin binding at the gene regions is directly linked to disease-specific expression changes.

Targeting the onset as well as progression of HD by small molecules could be a potent therapeutic approach. We have screened a set of small molecules to target this transcript and found Myricetin, a flavonoid, as a lead molecule that interacts with the CAG motif and thus prevents the translation of mutant huntingtin protein as well as sequestration of MBNL1. Here, we report the first solution structure of the complex formed between Myricetin and RNA containing the 5'CAG/3'GAC motif. Myricetin interacts with this RNA via base stacking at the AA mismatch. Moreover, Myricetin was also found reducing the proteo-toxicity generated due to the aggregation of polyglutamine, and further, its supplementation also improves neurobehavioral deficits in the HD mouse model.

The sudden increase in ROS shifts the natural balance toward a pro-oxidative state, resulting in oxidative stress. The detrimental effects of oxidative stress occur through multiple mechanisms that involve alterations to proteins and lipids, induction of inflammation, immunosuppression, DNA damage, and activation of signaling pathways that affect gene transcription, cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. All of these alterations promote carcinogenesis and therefore, regulation of ROS levels is critical to the maintenance of normal skin homeostasis. Several botanical products have been found to exhibit potent antioxidant capacity and the ability to counteract UV-induced insults to the skin. These natural products exert their beneficial effects through multiple pathways, including some known to be negatively affected by solar UVR. Aging of the skin is also accelerated by UVR exposure, in particular UVA rays that penetrate deep into the epidermis and the dermis where it causes the degradation of collagen and elastin fibers via oxidative stress and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Because natural compounds are capable of attenuating some of the UV-induced aging effects in the skin, increased attention has been generated in the area of cosmetic sciences. The focus of this review is to cover the most prominent phytoproducts with potential to mitigate the deleterious effects of solar UVR and suitability for use in topical application."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Studies have shown that skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) results in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus altering the cellular function.

The antioxidants, SOD and GPx activities were significantly high in neferine pretreated UV-B groups. Mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum damage were less evident in neferine-pretreated UV-B groups as compared with the control group, which might be associated with reduced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that neferine can prevent UV-B-induced oxidative damage and may thus be a potential agent for prevention and treatment of skin damage and photoaging."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure causes various injurious effects to human skin by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS).

UVR from sun exposure and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known to be a pivotal factor in the aetiology of skin cancer. The pineal hormone melatonin is recognized as the most potent endogenous antioxidant. Melatonin conducts its antioxidant effects acting directly as a radical scavenger and indirectly by up regulation of antioxidant enzymes. It has been proposed, that melatonin may have a protective effect against UVR-induced skin damage. The aim of this thesis was to: - Clarify melatonin's protective effect against UVR-induced skin damage in laboratory and clinical settings trough a systematic review of the literature. - To clinically assess the protective effect of topical treatment with melatonin against natural sun exposure, and determine the optimal concentration. - To clinically evaluate the degree of cognitive dysfunction with full body application of topical melatonin. Study 1: This was a systematic review using the databases Pubmed, EM-BASE and Cinahl. The databases were searched up to January 2013 to identify studies evaluating melatonin's protective effect against UVR-induced erythema in humans, and damage on a cellular level. Twenty studies were included, four human and 16 experimental. The results indicated that melatonin had a protective effect against UVR-induced erythema if applied before exposure, and this effect was probably obtained by melatonin acting directly as an antioxidant, and indirectly by regulating gene expression and inducing a DNA stabilizing effect. As these results were obtained using artificial UVR-sources and without investigating possible side effects, studies using natural sunlight and evaluating possible side effects of topical melatonin administration were warranted. Study 2: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We evaluated the protective effect of three different doses of topical melatonin against erythema induced by natural sun-light. The primary outcome was reduction in erythema, evaluated by chromatography, after sun exposure, when treated with topi-cal melatonin (0.5%, 2.5%, 12.5%) versus placebo and no treatment. A significant difference in erythema formation was found between areas treated with melatonin 12.5% and areas receiving placebo or no treatment. However, this was only seen in participants with an erythema reaction to the sun exposure. Further-more, the treated skin areas were very small and studies assessing any potential adverse effects were necessary. Study 3: This also was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. We assessed the degree of cognitive dysfunction with full body application of topical melatonin 12.5%. Cognition was evaluated using a neuropsychological test battery consisting of Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS), finger tapping test (FTT) and continuous reaction time (CRT). The impact on KSS was the primary outcome. We found no significant effect on cognition, however, large inter-individual variation was observed. These results support that melatonin is a safe drug for dermal application. The studies in this thesis may be valuable in the research field of melatonin's protective potential against UVR-induced oxidative skin damage. Increasing incidence of skin cancer is reported worldwide, and experts have suggested that the problem will only increase further, due to depletion of the ozone layer and the aging population. Furthermore, high-risk patient groups are emerging with the widely use of immunosuppressive medicine in various diseases, and this high-risk is in spite of use of protective measures known today. Therefore, development of new and more effective sun protective agents, with other qualities than simple chemical reflection of the UVR, is more important than ever. We have supported the suggestion of melatonin as a sun protective agent, and added the clinical relevant feature, that melatonin also has a protective effect against natural sunlight. Furthermore, we have supported the idea of melatonin being a safe drug for topical treatment, even in previous unknown high dosages. However, before any clinical implementation of melatonin as a sun protective agent can take place, further studies evaluating the long-term effects are warranted."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) derived from solar light causes skin damage by causing DNA lesions and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in keratinocytes and other epidermal cells.","answer_start":12}],"question":"What is known about ROS production in relation to UVR?","id":"5e481b2cd14c9f295d00000a_006","is_impossible":false}],"context":"BACKGROUND: Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) derived from solar light causes skin damage by causing DNA lesions and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in keratinocytes and other epidermal cells. The type 2 transmembrane serine protease matriptase has characteristics that allow keratinocytes to respond to/recover from, environmental insults to the skin. This response may depend on its roles in epidermal proliferation and early differentiation, and its rapid activation in response to changes in the cellular chemical milieu, including increased oxidative stress.OBJECTIVE: We investigate the regulation of matriptase activation and its role in the response of the skin to exposure to different parts of the UV spectrum including UVA UVB, and UVR.METHODS: The activation state and distribution of matriptase in ex vivo UV exposed human skin specimens and sun damaged skin samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. HaCaT immortalized human keratinocytes were also used to investigate the mechanism of matriptase zymogen activation induced by UV irradiation. Levels of cytosolic ROS were determined by H2DCF assay. Activated matriptase, PARP and caspase 3 cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting, and the apoptotic ratio was measured by Hoechst 33258 staining.RESULTS: UVB exposure rapidly increased matriptase zymogen activation in the basal keratinocytes of skin samples. Activated matriptase was also detected at much higher levels in both the basal and spinous layer keratinocytes in sun damaged skin with actinic elastosis. UVB and solar light-induced matriptase zymogen activation likely results from UV-induced ROS generation, given that UVR, UVA, and UVB irradiation induced HaCaT human keratinocytes to activate matriptase in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and that this was suppressed by the ROS scavenger N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone and reducing agent dithiothreitol. Matriptase deficient HaCaT keratinocytes were more susceptible to UV-induced apoptosis than control cells, suggesting a protective role for matriptase in UV exposed keratinocytes.CONCLUSION: UV irradiation/ROS induced matriptase proteolysis may have short term protective effects and contribute to the recovery from acute epidermal damage and/or pathology of skin with chronic sun damage.Copyright © 2016 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

To investigate these sex-dependent differences, we performed western blot analyses of striatal tissue. We measured equal mutant huntingtin protein expression in both sexes and found evidence of aggregation. We found the expected decrease of DARPP-32 expression only in female HdhQ350/+ mice. Remarkably, we found no evidence of reduction in synaptophysin or CB1 receptors in HdhQ350/+ tissue of either sex.

Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited NDD caused by autosomal-dominant expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat mutation in the gene coding for Huntingtin (Htt). Previous studies have suggested the coexistence of phosphorylated-Tau, α-synuclein (α-Syn) and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions in HD. However, definite evidence that HD pathology in humans can be accompanied by other proteinopathies is still lacking. Using human post-mortem putamen samples from 31 controls and 56 HD individuals, we performed biochemical analyses of the expression, oligomerization and aggregation of Tau, α-Syn, TDP-43, and Amyloid precursor protein (APP)/Aβ. In HD brain, we observed reduced soluble protein (but not mRNA) levels of Htt, α-Syn, and Tau. Our results also support abnormal phosphorylation of Tau in more advanced stages of disease. Aberrant splicing of Tau exons 2, 3 (exclusion) and 10 (inclusion) was also detected in HD patients, leading to higher 0N4R and lower 1N3R isoforms. Finally, following formic acid extraction, we observed increased aggregation of TDP-43, α-Syn, and phosphorylated-Tau during HD progression. Notably, we observed that 88% of HD patients with Vonsattel grade 4 neuropathology displayed at least one non-Htt proteinopathy compared to 29% in controls. Interestingly, α-Syn aggregation correlated with Htt, TDP-43 and phosphorylated-Tau in HD but not in controls. The impact of this work is twofold: (1) it provides compelling evidences that Tau, α-Syn and TDP-43 proteinopathies are increased in HD, and (2) it suggests the involvement of common mechanisms leading to abnormal accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins in NDD. Further studies will be needed to decipher the impact of these proteinopathies on clinical manifestation of HD."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":" Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by movement disorder, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline.","answer_start":176}],"question":"Is Huntington's disease caused by a dominate or recessive gene?","id":"5e31cbd4fbd6abf43b00004f_003","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Sirtuins and their pharmacological activators/inhibitors have been associated with a range of neuroprotective effects or disease modifying influences in neurological disorders. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by movement disorder, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline. The monogenic mutation in HD encodes a variant of the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The disease is a consequence of a CAG repeat extension leading to an abnormally long polyglutamine (Q) stretch at HTT's N-terminus, which likely confers a toxic gain of function to the mutant polypeptide. HD has currently no effective disease-modifying therapy or preventive measures. In the past 2decades, a sizable body of work on Sirtuins' modification of HD pathology using HD cell and animal models has accumulated. In this chapter, evidence for Sirtuin activities as potential modifiers of HD pathology is reviewed. The conflicting findings of the impacts of mammalian Sirtuin paralogs on HD pathogenesis and disease progression are highlighted. The possible cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Sirtuin activities in HD are discussed with reference to pathophysiological mechanisms of transcription perturbation, proteostasis, mitochondrial function, and microtubule dynamics.

We show that NUAK1 is activated by oxidative stress and that this activation is required to facilitate nuclear import of the antioxidant master regulator NRF2: Activation of NUAK1 coordinates PP1β inhibition with AKT activation in order to suppress GSK3β-dependent inhibition of NRF2 nuclear import.

One of the major shared features among AID is the predominance in the female sex which in some cases changes with the age at disease diagnosis. Numerous hypotheses have been formulated based on intuitive scientific backgrounds to justify this sex imbalance, i.e. sex hormones and reproductive factors, fetal microchimerism, other sex-related environmental factors, a skewing of the X-chromosome inactivation patterns, and major defects in sex chromosomes. Nevertheless, none of these hypotheses has thus far gathered enough convincing evidence and in most cases data are conflicting, as well illustrated by the reports on fetal microchimerism in systemic sclerosis or primary biliary cirrhosis. The present article will critically discuss the main hypotheses (loss of mosaicism, reactivation, and haploinsufficiency) that have been proposed based on findings in female patients with specific AID along with two additional mechanisms (X-chromosome vulnerability and X-linked polyamine genes) that have been observed in AID models. Further, recent data have significantly shifted the paradigm of X chromosome inactivation by demonstrating that a large number of genes can variably escape silencing on one or both chromosomes.

However, the vast majority of SLC40A1 mutations are rare missense variations, with only a few showing strong evidence of causality. The present study reports the results of an integrated approach collecting genetic and phenotypic data from 44 suspected hemochromatosis type 4 patients, with comprehensive structural and functional annotations. Causality was demonstrated for 10 missense variants, showing a clear dichotomy between the two hemochromatosis type 4 subtypes. Two subgroups of loss-of-function mutations were distinguished: one impairing cell-surface expression and one altering only iron egress. Additionally, a new gain-of-function mutation was identified, and the degradation of ferroportin on hepcidin binding was shown to probably depend on the integrity of a large extracellular loop outside of the hepcidin-binding domain.

Management of these conditions therefore relies on controlling serum uric acid levels. ATP-binding cassette transporter, sub-family G, member 2 (ABCG2/BCRP) is a well-studied urate transporter expressed on apical membranes in several tissues, including the intestine, liver, and kidney. Here, we discuss the potential of future gout therapies targeting ABCG2. Areas covered: ABCG2 regulates serum uric acid via physiologically important roles in both renal and extra-renal urate excretion. ABCG2 dysfunction, which promotes onset of hyperuricemia, often results in decreased urate excretion through the extra-renal (principally intestinal), rather than the renal pathway. This review covers recent attempts to establish the basis of ABCG2 function according to genetic diathesis, its molecular structure, and the effects of medication. Furthermore, the possibility of treating gout and hyperuricemia by upregulating intestinal ABCG2 expression is examined. Expert opinion: ABCG2 holds great promise as a therapeutic target for these conditions, particularly considering its involvement in extra-renal urate excretion. Manipulation of ABCG2, including controlling the level and location of its expression, has the potential to prevent gout by promoting uric acid excretion as effectively as general uricosuric drugs.ABBREVIATIONS: ATP-binding cassette (ABC), transmembrane domain (TMD), nucleotide binding domain (NBD), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"the discovery that ABCG2 plays a central role on extra-renal uric acid excretion,","answer_start":248}],"question":"Is the protein ABCG2 (ATP-Binding Cassette, subfamily G, member 2, transporter) excreting uric acid?","id":"5e5b5c6fb761aafe0900000a_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Over the last decade, there have been major advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of hyperuricaemia and gout as well as of the pharmacogenetics of urate-lowering therapy.

These advances, together with the reducing cost of whole genome sequencing, mean that integrated personalised medicine approaches may soon be possible in clinical practice. Genetic data may inform assessment of disease prognosis in individuals with hyperuricaemia or established gout, personalised lifestyle advice, selection and dosing of urate-lowering therapy, and prevention of serious medication adverse effects.

Background - CGRP was proposed as a target for primary headache therapies. Translational research involved moving from delineating the relationships between CGRP and primary headaches and the clinical development of anti-CGRP treatments. The first anti-CGRP treatment, an intravenous CGRP-receptor antagonist or gepant, olcegepant, was described as effective in terminating migraines in humans in 2004. Methods - The author briefly reviews some of the pathophysiology and translational research that led to the development of the gepants initially and then subsequently to the anti-CGRP and anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibodies. All accessible randomized controlled trials, abstracts, platform presentations, and press releases on the monoclonal antibody trials are summarized. The trajectory from bench research to the approval of the first anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody for clinical use in migraine prevention, erenumab, is discussed, as well as potential clinical uses of the anti-CGRP treatments. Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018. At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine, galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.

How DNA binding domains and cis-regulatory DNA binding sequences have co-evolved to allow the expansion of transcriptional networks and how this contributes to cellular fitness remains unclear. Here we experimentally explore how the complex G1/S transcriptional network evolved in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by examining different chimeric transcription factor (TF) complexes. Over 200 G1/S genes are regulated by either one of the two TF complexes, SBF and MBF, which bind to specific DNA binding sequences, SCB and MCB, respectively. The difference in size and complexity of the G1/S transcriptional network across yeast species makes it well suited to investigate how TF paralogs (SBF and MBF) and DNA binding sequences (SCB and MCB) co-evolved after gene duplication to rewire and expand the network of G1/S target genes. Our data suggests that whilst SBF is the likely ancestral regulatory complex, the ancestral DNA binding element is more MCB-like. G1/S network expansion took place by both cis- and trans- co-evolutionary changes in closely related but distinct regulatory sequences. Replacement of the endogenous SBF DNA-binding domain (DBD) with that from more distantly related fungi leads to a contraction of the SBF-regulated G1/S network in budding yeast, which also correlates with increased defects in cell growth, cell size, and proliferation."}]},{"title":"summary","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Scc2 (Nipbl) stimulates cohesin's ABC-like ATPase and is essential for loading cohesin onto chromosomes.

After checking whether the disease expression was delayed in women than in men in our study, the association between pregnancy and iron overload was assessed using multivariable regression analysis.RESULTS: Our study confirms that women with HFE hemochromatosis were diagnosed later than men cared for during the same period (52.6 vs. 47.4 y., P < 0.001). Compared to no pregnancy, having at least one pregnancy was not associated with lower iron markers. In contrast, the amount of iron removed by phlebotomies appeared significantly higher in women who had at least one pregnancy (eβ = 1.50, P = 0.047). This relationship disappeared after adjustment for confounding factors (eβ = 1.35, P = 0.088).CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that pregnancy status has no impact on iron markers level, and is not in favour of pregnancy being a protective factor in progressive iron accumulation.

Classic HH type 1, which is common in Caucasians, is caused by bi-allelic mutations of HFE. Severe types of HH are caused by either bi-allelic mutations of HFE2 that encodes hemojuvelin (type 2A) or HAMP that encodes hepcidin (type 2B). HH type 3, which is of intermediate severity, is caused by bi-allelic mutations of TFR2 that encodes transferrin receptor 2. Mutations of SLC40A1 that encodes ferroportin, the only cellular iron exporter, causes either HH type 4A (loss-of-function mutations) or HH type 4B (gain-of-function mutations). Studies on these gene products uncovered a part of the mechanisms of the systemic iron regulation; HFE, hemojuvelin, and TFR2 are involved in iron sensing and stimulating hepcidin expression, and hepcidin downregulates the expression of ferroportin of the target cells. Phlebotomy is the standard treatment for HH, and early initiation of the treatment is essential for preventing irreversible organ damage. However, because of the rarity and difficulty in making the genetic diagnosis, a large proportion of patients with non-HFE HH might have been undiagnosed; therefore, awareness of this disorder is important."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"hereditary hemochromatosis, an autosomal dominant iron overload condition with variable phenotypic manifestations.

Treatment of HH involves regular phlebotomy to reduce the systemic iron burden. In many countries-including the United States-numerous blood centers do not accept donated blood obtained from HH patients during therapeutic phlebotomy and there are inconsistent positions regarding this globally. This refusal of blood is borne out of a few concerns. First, there is a theoretical increase in the infectious risk of these blood products, particularly by siderophilic organisms such as Yersinia enterocolitica. Second, given the increased incidence of hepatitis C infection from nonvoluntary donors in the 1970s, there is a concern that blood units from HH donors may harbor additional risk given the nonvoluntary nature of their presentation. In this review, we examine the existing biological and clinical data concerning infectious risk and summarize clinical experience from centers allowing HH donors, and demonstrate that blood from HH patients is safe and should be allowed into the donor pool.

Adult intestinal mal-rotation is a rare condition of deviation from the normal 270° counter clockwise rotation of the midgut resulting in, not only mal-position of the small intestine, but also mal-fixation of the mesentery. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a rare complication of pelvic inflammatory disease; it involves liver capsule inflammation associated with genital tract infection, which is usually caused by Neisseria gonorrhoea and Chlamydia trachomatis. Neuroendocrine tumors are enterochromaffin cell neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems; the appendicular one is the most common primary malignant lesion of these tumors, it's incidence is about 0.3 - 0.9% of appendectomies done. Just for knowledge, this is the first described case of concomitant presence of all these diseases with clinical symptoms attributable to each one.CASE PRESENTATION: 40-years-old woman suffers from acute abdominal pain, predominantly on the right quadrants, without abdominal distension, no guarding nor rigidity and normal intestinal peristalsis. She has a long history of abdominal intermittent pain, with cramps every 30-40 min, resolving spontaneously. She was diagnosed as intestinal mal-rotation through computed tomography scan which has evidenced a mobilized intra--peritoneal duodenum with cecum/ascending colon predominately lying on the left side and the small intestine almost entirely lying on the right side of abdomen, without evidence of effusion, edema or signs of intestinal ischemia or infarction. Exploratory laparoscopy demonstrated an inflammatory process in the hepatic-renal space, with bloody adhesions above the liver capsule; this is additional to the typical pelvic inflammatory disease signs (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome). Appendectomy was performed with histological analysis resulting in appendicular neuroendocrine tumor.CONCLUSIONS: Although the patient has an intestinal mal-rotation which could explain the abdominal painful symptoms, it is not possible to exclude other concomitant causes, such as perihepatitis on pelvic inflammatory disease or neuroendocrine tumors.

Thyroid hormone T3 stimulation to human hepatocyte models showed direct transcriptional activation of ABCB4 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To determine whether THRβ1 (the main THR isoform of the liver) is involved in regulation, we tested THRβ1-specific agonists (e.g., GC-1, KB-141); these agonists resulted in greater stimulation than the native hormone. KB-141 activated hepatic ABCB44 expression in mice, which enhanced biliary PC secretion in vivo. We also identified THR response elements 6 kb upstream of the ABCB4 locus that were conserved in humans and mice. Thus, T3-via THRβ1 as a novel transcriptional activator regulates ABCB4 to increase ABCB4 protein levels at the canalicular membrane and promote PC secretion into bile.

We developed Promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) to enable the genome-wide detection of distal promoter-interacting regions (PIRs), for all promoters in a single experiment. In PCHi-C, highly complex Hi-C libraries are specifically enriched for promoter sequences through in-solution hybrid selection with thousands of biotinylated RNA baits complementary to the ends of all promoter-containing restriction fragments. The aim is to then pull-down promoter sequences and their frequent interaction partners such as enhancers and other potential regulatory elements. After high-throughput paired-end sequencing, a statistical test is applied to each promoter-ligated restriction fragment to identify significant PIRs at the restriction fragment level. We have used PCHi-C to generate an atlas of long-range promoter interactions in dozens of human and mouse cell types. These promoter interactome maps have contributed to a greater understanding of mammalian gene expression control by assigning putative regulatory regions to their target genes and revealing preferential spatial promoter-promoter interaction networks. This information also has high relevance to understanding human genetic disease and the identification of potential disease genes, by linking non-coding disease-associated sequence variants in or near control sequences to their target genes."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Here, we use Capture Hi-C (CHi-C) to annotate 63 loci; we identify 110 putative target genes at 33 loci.

Ube2W is the only ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) known to ubiquitinate substrates at their amino (N)-termini, likely favoring substrates with disordered N-termini.

In studies employing immortalized cells, primary neurons and a knock-in (KI) mouse model of HD, we tested the effect of Ube2W deficiency on mHTT levels, aggregation and neurotoxicity. In cultured cells, deficiency of Ube2W activity markedly decreases mHTT aggregate formation and increases the level of soluble monomers, while reducing mHTT-induced cytotoxicity.

The demonstration of harmful effects from widely used IPF therapies has been equally important. Pirfenidone and nintedanib are emerging agents that exert pleiotropic effects, reflective of the multiple mechanistic pathways of IPF. Treatment may necessitate a similarly multifaceted approach using combination regimens of antifibrotic and antioxidant agents in order to be effective. In other ILDs, including systemic sclerosis, other connective tissue diseases and pulmonary sarcoidosis, the inflammatory/fibrotic model remains appropriate. Studies in systemic sclerosis have provided 'proof of concept' data for immunosuppressive therapy in the prevention of disease progression but there is a continuing need for controlled clinical trials in the more prevalent ILDs.EXPERT OPINION: In IPF, significant treatment effects have been reported with pirfenidone, nintedanib and N-acetylcysteine. Combinations of these pleiotropic agents, along with future monotherapies, in 'oncological regimens' may hold the key to more effective IPF treatment. In disorders other than IPF, there is an ongoing need for the controlled evaluation of traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies.

Because adenine methylation does not occur endogenously in most eukaryotes, it provides a unique tag to mark protein interaction sites. The adenine-methylated DNA fragments are isolated by selective polymerase chain reaction amplification and can be identified by microarray hybridization. We and others have successfully applied DamID to the genome-wide identification of interaction sites of several transcription factors and other chromatin-associated proteins.

The initial diagnosis of SARS was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. During the outbreak, molecular and serologic tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) became available. However, without a \"gold standard,\" it was impossible to determine the usefulness of these tests. We describe how these tests were used during the first phase of the SARS outbreak in Toronto and offer some recommendations that may be useful if SARS returns.METHODS: We examined the results of all diagnostic laboratory tests used in 117 patients admitted to hospitals in Toronto who met the Health Canada criteria for suspect or probable SARS. Focusing on tests for SARS-CoV, we attempted to determine the optimal specimen types and timing of specimen collection.RESULTS: Diagnostic test results for SARS-CoV were available for 110 of the 117 patients. SARS-CoV was detected by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in at least one specimen in 59 (54.1%) of 109 patients. Serologic test results of convalescent samples were positive in 50 (96.2%) of 52 patients for whom paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. Of the 110 patients, 78 (70.9%) had specimens that tested positive by means of RT-PCR, serologic testing or both methods. The proportion of RT-PCR test results that were positive was similar between patients who met the criteria for suspect SARS (50.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.4%-63.2%) and those who met the criteria for probable SARS (58.0%, 95% CI 44.2%-70.7%). SARS-CoV was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs in 33 (32.4%) of 102 patients, in stool specimens in 19 (63.3%) of 30 patients, and in specimens from the lower respiratory tract in 10 (58.8%) of 17 patients.INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that the rapid diagnostic tests in use at the time of the initial outbreak lack sufficient sensitivity to be used clinically to rule out SARS. As tests for SARS-CoV continue to be optimized, evaluation of the clinical presentation and elucidation of a contact history must remain the cornerstone of SARS diagnosis. In patients with SARS, specimens taken from the lower respiratory tract and stool samples test positive by means of RT-PCR more often than do samples taken from other areas."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Encorafenib (LGX818) is a promising BRAFV600E inhibitor that has efficacy against metastatic melanoma.

In polarized MDCK-II cells, encorafenib was efficiently transported by canine and human ABCB1 and ABCG2 and by mouse Abcg2. Upon oral administration to wild-type, Abcb1a/1b-/-, Abcg2-/-, and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2-/- mice, encorafenib was absorbed very quickly and to very high plasma levels, but without clear changes in oral availability between the strains.

Here, we show the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) panobinostat overcomes BRAFi resistance in melanoma, but this is dependent on the resistant cells showing a partial response to BRAFi treatment. Using patient- and in vivo-derived melanoma cell lines with acquired BRAFi resistance, we show that combined treatment with the BRAFi encorafenib and HDACi panobinostat in 2D and 3D culture systems synergistically induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. Key changes induced by HDAC inhibition included decreased PI3K pathway activity associated with a reduction in the protein level of a number of receptor tyrosine kinases, and cell line dependent upregulation of pro-apoptotic BIM or NOXA together with reduced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Independent of these changes, panobinostat reduced c-Myc and pre-treatment of cells with siRNA against c-Myc reduced BRAFi/HDACi drug-induced cell death.

Inhibitors selective for the BRAFV600E oncoprotein, the most common BRAF mutant, elicit only poor response rates in BRAF-mutant CRC as single agents. This unresponsiveness was mechanistically attributed to the loss of negative feedbacks on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and initiated clinical trials that combine BRAF (and MEK) inhibitors, either singly or in combination, with the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab. First results of these combinatorial studies demonstrated improved efficacy, however, the response rates still were heterogeneous. Here, we show that BRAF inhibition leads to the upregulation of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in CRC cell lines, including not only the EGFR, but also human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER3. Importantly, combination of the BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) vemurafenib (PLX4032), dabrafenib, or encorafenib with inhibitors dually targeting the EGFR and HER2 (such as lapatinib, canertinib, and afatinib) significantly reduced the metabolic activity and proliferative potential of CRC cells. This re-sensitization was also observed after genetic depletion of HER2 or HER3. Interestingly, BRAF inhibitors did not only upregulate RTKs, but also increased the abundance of the GRB2-associated binders (Gab) 1 and Gab2, two important amplifiers of RTK signaling. An allele-specific shRNA-mediated knockdown of BRAFV600E revealed that Gab2 upregulation was directly dependent on the loss of the oncoprotein and was not caused by an \"off-target\" effect of these kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, Gab2 and Gab2-mediated Shp2 signaling were shown to be functionally important in BRAFi resistance.

This result provides strong support for recent studies that have suggested that transcription at low levels does not displace nucleosomes, while transcription at high levels does, and adds the idea that Spt6 is required for restoration of nucleosomes at the highly transcribed genes. Unexpectedly, our studies have also suggested that the spt6 effects on nucleosome levels across coding regions do not cause the spt6 effects on mRNA levels, suggesting that the role of Spt6 across coding regions is separate from its role in transcriptional regulation. In the case of the CHA1 gene, regulation by Spt6 likely occurs by controlling the position of the +1 nucleosome.

HTA1-lacZ transcription was reduced in each spt mutant background, an effect that required a negative site in the HTA1 promoter. The transcriptional effect could be reversed by the overproduction of histones H2A and H2B in an spt4 mutant and histones H3 and H4 in all three spt mutants.

This often occurs in response to injury or inflammation, leading to joint immobilization and significant disability. There are currently no definitive treatment options for this devastating disease. Although the most dramatic phenotype in FOP is the episodic and progressive heterotopic ossification, patients report a number of symptoms that affect other organ systems. Post-mortem examination of FOP patients may contribute to our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and complications of this disease. Here, we present the autopsy findings from three patients with FOP.FINDINGS: Autopsy findings in two of the three patients confirmed that the cause of death was cardiorespiratory failure in the setting of severe thoracic insufficiency from heterotopic ossification. Both of these patients also had evidence of right ventricular dilatation likely secondary to thoracic insufficiency. The third patient died from complications of a traumatic head injury after a fall but also had post-mortem evidence of thoracic insufficiency syndrome. All three patients had extensive, widespread heterotopic ossification and joint deformities consistent with FOP. There was extensive ossification of the spinal ligament in these patients, which may contribute to cervical spine rigidity. One patient was diagnosed post-mortem with a brainstem malformation. No additional significant abnormalities were noted in the other organ systems. Finally, we also demonstrate that cadaveric skin fibroblasts can be isolated for use as a potential source for future in vitro cell culture studies.CONCLUSIONS: This autopsy case series provides valuable information about the underlying complications of FOP and contributes significantly to our knowledge of this rare yet debilitating disorder. Thoracic insufficiency syndrome, right heart dysfunction, widespread heterotopic ossification, spinal ligament ossification, and CNS malformations were clearly evident; however, most other non-bone tissues appeared to be spared from gross malformations. Finally, the ability to isolate live cells from cadaveric skin is an important technique that will facilitate future studies, particularly as induced pluripotent stem cells and other cell-based technologies evolve. This case series highlights the importance of post-mortem examinations and their contribution to our current knowledge of disease pathophysiology and comorbidities.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Metaphyseal exostoses were present in all the 17 cases of FOP studied. Although most often arising from the distal femoral (where metaphyseal exostoses adopt a peculiar not yet reported appearance) and proximal tibial bones, we have found that they are not restricted to these areas, but rather can be seen scattered at a variety of other skeletal sites. Using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, we show that these exophytic outgrowths are true osteochondromas. As a whole, these results are in agreement with data coming from the literature review. Our study confirms the presence of metaphyseal osteochondromas as a very frequent trait of FOP phenotype and an outstanding feature of its anomalous skeletal developmental component.

In this disease, HO can occur in discrete flares, often triggered by injury or inflammation, or may progress incrementally without identified triggers. Mice harboring an Acvr1R206H knock-in allele recapitulate the phenotypic spectrum of FOP, including injury-responsive intramuscular HO and spontaneous articular, tendon, and ligament ossification. The cells that drive HO in these diverse tissues can be compartmentalized into two lineages: an Scx+ tendon-derived progenitor that mediates endochondral HO of ligaments and joints without exogenous injury, and a muscle-resident interstitial Mx1+ population that mediates intramuscular, injury-dependent endochondral HO. Expression of Acvr1R206H in either lineage confers aberrant gain of BMP signaling and chondrogenic differentiation in response to activin A and gives rise to mutation-expressing hypertrophic chondrocytes in HO lesions. Compared to Acvr1R206H, expression of the man-made, ligand-independent ACVR1Q207D mutation accelerates and increases the penetrance of all observed phenotypes, but does not abrogate the need for antecedent injury in muscle HO, demonstrating the need for an injury factor in addition to enhanced BMP signaling. Both injury-dependent intramuscular and spontaneous ligament HO in Acvr1R206H knock-in mice were effectively controlled by the selective ACVR1 inhibitor LDN-212854.

Poisson regression analyses were used to characterize radiation effects on tumor incidence, which are expressed as excess relative risk per sievert (ERR(Sv)). All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: A statistically significant dose-related excess of nervous system tumors was observed in the cohort (ERR(Sv) = 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6 to 2.1). The highest ERR(Sv) was seen for schwannoma (4.5, 95% CI = 1.9 to 9.2). The risk for all other nervous system tumors as a group is also statistically significantly elevated (ERR(Sv) = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.1 to 1.3). Risk increases, although not statistically significant, were seen for meningiomas (ERR(Sv) = 0.6, 95% CI = -0.01 to 1.8), gliomas (ERR(Sv) = 0.6, 95% CI = -0.2 to 2.0), other nervous system tumors (ERR(Sv) = 0.5, 95% CI = <-0.2 to 2.2), and pituitary tumors (ERR(Sv) = 1.0, 95% CI = <-0.2 to 3.5). The dose-response relationships were linear. For nervous system tumors other than schwannoma, excess risks were higher for men than for women and for those exposed during childhood than for those exposed during adulthood.CONCLUSIONS: A statistically significant dose response was observed for all nervous system tumors combined and for schwannoma considered separately, indicating that exposure to even moderate doses (i.e., <1 Sv) of radiation is associated with an elevated incidence of nervous system tumors."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The incidence of meningioma among Hiroshima atomic bomb survivors has increased since 1975.

Here, we developed a novel approach to infer cell-specific pathways and identify a compound's effects using gene expression and phosphoproteomics data under treatments with different compounds. Gene expression data were employed to infer potential targets of compounds and create a generic pathway map. Binary linear programming (BLP) was then developed to optimize the generic pathway topology based on the mid-stage signaling response of phosphorylation. To demonstrate effectiveness of this approach, we built a generic pathway map for the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and inferred the cell-specific pathways by BLP. The first group of 11 compounds was utilized to optimize the generic pathways, and then 4 compounds were used to identify effects based on the inferred cell-specific pathways. Cross-validation indicated that the cell-specific pathways reliably predicted a compound's effects. Finally, we applied BLP to re-optimize the cell-specific pathways to predict the effects of 4 compounds (trichostatin A, MS-275, staurosporine, and digoxigenin) according to compound-induced topological alterations. Trichostatin A and MS-275 (both HDAC inhibitors) inhibited the downstream pathway of HDAC1 and caused cell growth arrest via activation of p53 and p21; the effects of digoxigenin were totally opposite. Staurosporine blocked the cell cycle via p53 and p21, but also promoted cell growth via activated HDAC1 and its downstream pathway.

They can transfer information between cells and may cause pathology, for example, a role for exosomes has been proposed in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Although studied in several biofluids, exosomes have not been extensively studied in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from humans. The objective of this study was to determine: 1) whether human CSF contains exosomes and 2) the variability in exosomal protein content across individuals.METHODS: CSF was collected from 5 study participants undergoing thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (around 200 - 500 ml per participant) and low-density membrane vesicles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The presence of exosomes was determined by western blot for marker proteins, isopycnic centrifugation on a sucrose step gradient and transmission electron microscopy with immuno-labelling. Whole protein profiling was performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR).RESULTS: Flotillin 1 and tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), two exosomal marker proteins, were identified in the ultracentrifugation pellet using western blot. These markers localized to a density consistent with exosomes following isopycnic centrifugation. Transmission electron microscopy visualized structures consistent with exosomes in size and appearance that labelled positive for flotillin 1. Therefore, the pellet that resulted from ultracentrifugation of human CSF contained exosomes. FT-ICR profiling of this pellet was performed and 84-161 ions were detected per study participant. Around one third of these ions were only present in a single study participant and one third were detected in all five. With regard to ion quantity, the median coefficient of variation was 81% for ions detected in two or more samples.CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes were identified in human CSF and their proteome is a potential new reservoir for biomarker discovery in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, techniques used to concentrate exosomes from CSF need refinement to reduce variability.

Unexpectedly, we found that CBX1 (formerly HP1beta) and SUV39H1 bind to genes encoding KRAB domain containing zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) transcriptional repressors. These genes constitute one of the largest gene families and are organized in clusters in the human genome. Preference of CBX1 for this gene family was observed in both human and mouse cells. High-resolution mapping on human chromosome 19 revealed that CBX1 coats large domains 0.1-4 Mb in size, which coincide with the position of KRAB-ZNF gene clusters. These domains show an intricate CBX1 binding pattern: While CBX1 is globally elevated throughout the domains, it is absent from the promoters and binds more strongly to the 3' ends of KRAB-ZNF genes. KRAB-ZNF domains contain large numbers of LINE elements, which may contribute to CBX1 recruitment.

In our study, we determine the composition of immune mediators in aqueous humor of patients with PSS and FU and evaluate if immune mediators play a crucial role in specific viral intraocular inflammation and IOP rises. Aqueous humor samples from 81 uveitis patients (= eyes) presenting with either PSS or FU were collected at one time point.

Although the distinct biological functions of most KRAB-ZNF proteins remain unknown, recent publications indicate their implication in fundamental processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, development, and tumorigenesis. SZF1/ZNF589 was first identified as a gene with SZF1-1 isoform specifically expressed in CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, strongly suggesting a role in epigenetic control of gene expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, the function of SZF1/ZNF589 in hematopoiesis has not yet been elucidated. Our study reveals SZF1/ZNF589 as a gene with a human-specific nucleotide DNA-change, conferring potential species-specific functional properties. Through shRNA-mediated loss-of-function experiments, we found that changes in expression of fundamental apoptosis-controlling genes are induced on SZF1/ZNF589 knockdown, resulting in inhibited growth of hematopoietic cell lines and decreased progenitor potential of primary human bone marrow CD34(+) cells. Moreover, we found that the SZF1/ZNF589 gene is differentially regulated during hypoxia in CD34(+) HSPCs in a cytokine-dependent manner, implicating its possible involvement in the maintenance of the hypoxic physiologic status of hematopoietic stem cells.

Clinical, biological, and imaging data were analyzed.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (19 males, 9 females) were analyzed. Diagnosis was made before the age of 10 years in 16 cases. Main symptoms at diagnosis were spleen/liver enlargement and interstitial lung disease. Biological abnormalities included: thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 000/mm3) in 24 cases including 4 patients with platelet count <60 000/mm3, constantly low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (n=6), monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (n=5), normal prothrombin level discordant with low factor V (n=5), elevated chitotriosidase level (n=11). The diagnosis was confirmed in all cases by deficient acid sphingomyelinase enzyme activity. SMPD1 gene sequencing was performed in 25 cases. The frequent p.R610del mutation was largely predominant, constituting 62% of the non-related alleles. During the follow-up period, three patients died before 50 years of age from cirrhosis, heart failure and lung insufficiency, respectively.CONCLUSION: ASMD in adulthood (NP-B) associates spleen/liver enlargement and interstitial lung disease.

NPD A is associated with a uniformly devastating disease course, with rapidly progressing psychomotor degeneration, leading to death typically by the age of 3 years, most often from respiratory failure. In contrast, the clinical phenotype and life expectancy of patients with NPD B may vary widely. Almost all patients have hepatosplenomegaly and an atherogenic lipid profile, and most patients have interstitial lung disease with progressive impairment of pulmonary function and hematologic abnormalities including cytopenias.

Some patients with ASMD who survive beyond early childhood have intermediate phenotypes (variant NPD B) characterized by combinations of non-neurologic and mild to severe neurologic symptoms. The physical and psychosocial burden of illness in patients with NPD B is substantial. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, joint or limb pain, abdominal pain, bleeding and bruising. The disease often leads to chronic fatigue, limited physical or social activity and difficulties in performing daily activities or work.

Autoimmunity directed against pancreatic islet cells results in slowly progressive selective beta-cell destruction (\"Primary autoimmune insulitis\"), culminating over years in clinically manifested insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Circulating serum autoantibodies directed against the endocrine cells of the islets of Langerhans (Islet cell autoantibodies - ICAb) are an important hallmark of this disease. Assays for islet cell autoantibodies have facilitated the investigation and understanding of several facets in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. Their applications have extended into clinical practice and have opened new avenues for early preclinical prediction and preventive prophylaxis in IDDM/type 1 DM. Recently, surprisingly, differences in insulin content between T1DM islets, as well as, 'patchy' or 'lobular' destruction of islets have been described. These unique pathobiological phenomena, suggest that beta cell destruction may not always be inexorable and inevitably complete/total, and thus raise hopes for possible therapeutic interruption of beta cell autoimmunity - destruction and cure of type 1 diabetes. \"Recurrent or secondary autoimmune insulitis\" refers to the rapid reappearance of islet cell autoantibodies post pancreas transplant, and selective islet beta cell destruction in the grafted pancreas [never forgetting or \"anamnestic\" beta cell destructive memory], in the absence of any graft pancreas rejection [monozygotic twin to twin transplantation]. The one definite environmental factor is congenital rubella, because of which a subset of children subsequently develop type 1 diabetes. The putative predisposing factors are viruses, gluten and cow's milk. The putative protective factors include gut flora, helminths, viral infections, and Vitamin D. Prevention of T1DM can include: Primary prevention strategies before the development of autoantibodies and Secondary prevention regimens after autoantibody development. Once islet cell autoantibodies have developed, the goal is to establish a therapeutic regimen to preserve at least 90% of the beta cells, and prevent the development of hyperglycaemia. The targets for T1DM reversal should include autoimmunity, beta cell regeneration and protection of beta cell mass.

Participants were allocated (2:1:1:1 ratio) by an interactive telephone system, according to computer-generated block randomisation, to receive one of three regimens of teplizumab infusions (14-day full dose, 14-day low dose, or 6-day full dose) or placebo at baseline and at 26 weeks. The Protégé study is still underway, and patients and study staff remain masked through to study closure. The primary composite outcome was the percentage of patients with insulin use of less than 0·5 U/kg per day and glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1C)) of less than 6·5% at 1 year. Analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00385697.FINDINGS: 763 patients were screened, of whom 516 were randomised to receive 14-day full-dose teplizumab (n=209), 14-day low-dose teplizumab (n=102), 6-day full-dose teplizumab (n=106), or placebo (n=99). Two patients in the 14-day full-dose group and one patient in the placebo group did not start treatment, so 513 patients were eligible for efficacy analyses. The primary outcome did not differ between groups at 1 year: 19·8% (41/207) in the 14-day full-dose group; 13·7% (14/102) in the 14-day low-dose group; 20·8% (22/106) in the 6-day full-dose group; and 20·4% (20/98) in the placebo group. 5% (19/415) of patients in the teplizumab groups were not taking insulin at 1 year, compared with no patients in the placebo group at 1 year (p=0·03). Across the four study groups, similar proportions of patients had adverse events (414/417 [99%] in the teplizumab groups vs 98/99 [99%] in the placebo group) and serious adverse events (42/417 [10%] vs 9/99 [9%]). The most common clinical adverse event in the teplizumab groups was rash (220/417 [53%] vs 20/99 [20%] in the placebo group).INTERPRETATION: Findings of exploratory analyses suggest that future studies of immunotherapeutic intervention with teplizumab might have increased success in prevention of a decline in β-cell function (measured by C-peptide) and provision of glycaemic control at reduced doses of insulin if they target patients early after diagnosis of diabetes and children.FUNDING: MacroGenics, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, and Eli Lilly.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Cytoplasmic degradation systems, such as the autophagy-lysosome and proteasome pathways, are involved in their pathogenesis. Autophagy is tightly regulated by several upstream proteins including UNC-51-like kinase 1/2, beclin1, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 34 and autophagy/beclin1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1). Recently, we revealed that both cortical and brainstem-type Lewy bodies were immunopositive for several upstream proteins of autophagy. Therefore, we conducted the present study to elucidate the role of upstream proteins of autophagy in the pathogenesis of MSA. Pathological and biochemical analyses using human brain samples revealed that AMBRA1 is a component of the pathological hallmarks of MSA and upstream proteins of autophagy are impaired in the MSA brain. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed a ninefold stronger affinity of AMBRA1 with α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 compared with non-phosphorylated α-synuclein. Furthermore, a weak but significant correlation between AMBRA1 overexpression and reduction of abnormal α-synuclein was observed. Silencing AMBRA1 function caused aggregates of α-synuclein in the cytoplasm of mouse primary cultured neurons, which was simulated by the treatment of Bafilomycin, an autophagy inhibitor. Our results demonstrated for the first time that AMBRA1 is a novel hub binding protein of α-synuclein and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of MSA through the degradative dynamics of α-synuclein. These results raise the possibility that molecular modulation targeting AMBRA1 can be a promising candidate for the treatment of synucleinopathies."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates in neurons, nerve fibers, or glial cells is the hallmark of a group of neurodegenerative diseases known collectively as α-synucleinopathies","answer_start":0}],"question":"What is Synucleinopathy?","id":"5e40260f48dab47f2600000c_003","is_impossible":false}],"context":"The abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates in neurons, nerve fibers, or glial cells is the hallmark of a group of neurodegenerative diseases known collectively as α-synucleinopathies.

Specific properties of α-synuclein, such as its ability to pass from one neuron to another, its tendency to aggregate, and its potential to generate self-propagating species, have been described and elucidated in animal models and may contribute to the relentless exacerbation of Parkinson's disease pathology in patients. Animal models used for studying α-synuclein accumulation, aggregation, and propagation are mostly based on three approaches: (1) intra-parenchymal inoculations of exogenous α-synuclein (e.g., synthetic α-synuclein fibrils), (2) transgenic mice, and (3) animals (mice or rats) in which α-synuclein overexpression is induced by viral vector injections. Whereas pathological α-synuclein changes are consistently observed in these models, important differences are also found.

Romiplostim (ROM) is a thrombopoietin (TPO)-receptor-agonist approved for treatment of adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The immature platelet fraction (IPF) is a novel measure of newly produced platelets, which could aid with the diagnostic evaluation of thrombocytopenic neonates. This study had the following two objectives: (1) compare the response of newborn and adult mice to escalating doses of ROM in vivo and (2) assess the correlation between IPF and megakaryocyte (MK) mass in newborn and adult treated and untreated mice. In the first set of studies, newborn (day 1) and adult mice received a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of ROM ranging from 0 to 300 ng/g, and platelet counts were followed every other day for 14 days. Both sets of mice responded with dose-dependent platelet and IPF increases, peaking on days 5-7 post-treatment, but neonates had a blunted response (2.1-fold compared to 4.2-fold maximal increase in platelet counts, respectively). On day 5 post-treatment with 300 ng/g ROM, MKs in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen of adult mice were significantly increased in numbers and size (p < 0.0001 for both) compared to controls. MKs in the spleen and BM (but not liver) of treated neonates also increased in number, but not in size. The immature platelet count (IPC, calculated as IPF x platelet count) was highly correlated with the MK number and size in neonatal and adult BM and spleen, but not neonatal liver. The lack of response of neonatal liver MKs was not due to a cell-intrinsic reduced responsiveness to TPO, since neonatal liver progenitors were more sensitive to murine TPO (mTPO) in vitro than adult BM progenitor. In vivo treatment of newborn mice with high mTPO doses or with higher doses of ROM (900 ng/g) resulted in peak platelet counts approaching 3-fold of controls. Taken together, our data indicate that newborn mice are less responsive to ROM than adult mice in vivo, due to a combination of likely pharmacokinetic differences and developmental differences in the response of MKs to thrombopoietic stimulation, evidenced by neonatal MKs increasing in numbers but not in size.

Using interactive response technology to assign numbers linked to treatment arms, patients (age 18-60 years) with SPMS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 3·0-6·5 were randomly assigned (2:1) to once daily oral siponimod 2 mg or placebo for up to 3 years or until the occurrence of a prespecified number of confirmed disability progression (CDP) events. The primary endpoint was time to 3-month CDP. Efficacy was assessed for the full analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned and treated patients); safety was assessed for the safety set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01665144.FINDINGS: 1651 patients were randomly assigned between Feb 5, 2013, and June 2, 2015 (1105 to the siponimod group, and 546 to the placebo group). One patient did not sign the consent form, and five patients did not receive study drug, all of whom were in the siponimod group. 1645 patients were included in the analyses (1099 in the siponimod group and 546 in the placebo). At baseline, the mean time since first multiple sclerosis symptoms was 16·8 years (SD 8·3), and the mean time since conversion to SPMS was 3·8 years (SD 3·5); 1055 (64%) patients had not relapsed in the previous 2 years, and 918 (56%) of 1651 needed walking assistance. 903 (82%) patients receiving siponimod and 424 (78%) patients receiving placebo completed the study. 288 (26%) of 1096 patients receiving siponimod and 173 (32%) of 545 patients receiving placebo had 3-month CDP (hazard ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·65-0·95; relative risk reduction 21%; p=0·013). Adverse events occurred in 975 (89%) of 1099 patients receiving siponimod versus 445 (82%) of 546 patients receiving placebo; serious adverse events were reported for 197 (18%) patients in the siponimod group versus 83 (15%) patients in the placebo group. Lymphopenia, increased liver transaminase concentration, bradycardia and bradyarrhythmia at treatment initiation, macular oedema, hypertension, varicella zoster reactivation, and convulsions occurred more frequently with siponimod than with placebo.

Although most MS patients have a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS) at disease onset, a substantial proportion later develop chronic progression, termed secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Approximately 10% of MS patients experience chronic progression from disease onset, termed primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Although several disease-modifying treatment (DMT) options exist for relapsing forms of this disease, DMT options are few for progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS). Herein, we strive to define progressive MS, review major clinical trials aimed at progressive MS, and delineate potential strategies in the management of progressive MS.RECENT FINDINGS: In 2017, the first DMT for PPMS, the B lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody, ocrelizumab, came to market. Ocrelizumab reduced 12-week confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 24% versus placebo. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, reduced 3-month CDP by 21% versus placebo in SPMS. Ibudilast slowed brain atrophy in PPMS and SPMS patients in a multicenter phase 2b study. Smaller early phase studies of alpha-lipoic acid and simvastatin each found slowing of rate of whole brain atrophy in SPMS patients.

In mice, these effects were sustained over the 9-month study duration, while in rats increased mitotic gene expression was present at day 3 only and PLGF2 was induced only during the first week of treatment. In the mouse, the persistent VEC activation, mitosis induction, and PLGF2 stimulation likely led to sustained neo-angiogenesis which over life-long treatment may result in HSA formation. In rats, despite sustained VEC activation, the transient mitotic and PLGF2 stimuli did not result in the formation of HSA. In vitro, the mouse and rat primary endothelial cell cultures mirrored their respective in vivo findings for cell proliferation and PLGF2 release. Human VECs, like rat cells, were unresponsive to siponimod treatment with no proliferative response and no release of PLGF2 at all tested concentrations. Hence, it is suggested that the human cells also reproduce a lack of in vivo response to siponimod.

Knowing if a reduced Nipped-B or Pds5 dosage changes how much cohesin binds chromosomes, or the stability with which it binds, is critical information for understanding how cohesin regulates transcription. We addressed this question by in vivo fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) with Drosophila salivary glands.

Cohesin movement changes from bidirectional to unidirectional when cohesin faces DNA replication; otherwise, it is incorporated into replicating DNA without being translocated or is dissociated from replicating DNA This study provides insight into the nature of individual cohesin dynamics and the mechanisms by which cohesin achieves cohesion in different chromatin contexts."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":" the cohesin unloading factor WAPL and its PDS5 binding partners control the length of loops.","answer_start":529}],"question":"What is the interaction between WAPL and PDS5 proteins?","id":"5d35c070b3a6380763000006_005","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Mammalian genomes are spatially organized into compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and loops to facilitate gene regulation and other chromosomal functions.

Cohesin also participates in DNA repair and gene transcription. The Nipped-B-Mau2 protein complex loads cohesin onto chromosomes and the Pds5-Wapl complex removes cohesin. Pds5 is also essential for sister chromatid cohesion, indicating that it has functions beyond cohesin removal. The Brca2 DNA repair protein interacts with Pds5, but the roles of this complex beyond DNA repair are unknown. Here we show that Brca2 opposes Pds5 function in sister chromatid cohesion by assaying precocious sister chromatid separation in metaphase spreads of cultured cells depleted for these proteins. By genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation we find that Pds5 facilitates SA cohesin subunit association with DNA replication origins and that Brca2 inhibits SA binding, mirroring their effects on sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin binding is maximal at replication origins and extends outward to occupy active genes and regulatory sequences.

Changes to the DIS definition included removal of the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions, increasing the number of lesions needed to define periventricular involvement to three, combining cortical and juxtacortical lesions, and inclusion of optic nerve evaluation. For DIT, removal of the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions was suggested. We compared the performance of the 2010 McDonald and 2016 MAGNIMS criteria for multiple sclerosis diagnosis in a large multicentre cohort of patients with CIS to provide evidence to guide revisions of multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria.METHODS: Brain and spinal cord MRI and optic nerve assessments from patients with typical CIS suggestive of multiple sclerosis done less than 3 months from clinical onset in eight European multiple sclerosis centres were included in this retrospective study. Eligible patients were 16-60 years, and had a first CIS suggestive of CNS demyelination and typical of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, a complete neurological examination, a baseline brain and spinal cord MRI scan obtained less than 3 months from clinical onset, and a follow-up brain scan obtained less than 12 months from CIS onset. We recorded occurrence of a second clinical attack (clinically definite multiple sclerosis) at months 36 and 60. We evaluated MRI criteria performance for DIS, DIT, and DIS plus DIT with a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.FINDINGS: Between June 16, 1995, and Jan 27, 2017, 571 patients with CIS were screened, of whom 368 met all study inclusion criteria. At the last evaluation (median 50·0 months [IQR 27·0-78·4]), 189 (51%) of 368 patients developed clinically definite multiple sclerosis. At 36 months, the two DIS criteria showed high sensitivity (2010 McDonald 0·91 [95% CI 0·85-0·94] and 2016 MAGNIMS 0·93 [0·88-0·96]), similar specificity (0·33 [0·25-0·42] and 0·32 [0·24-0·41]), and similar area under the curve values (AUC; 0·62 [0·57-0·67] and 0·63 [0·58-0·67]). Performance was not affected by inclusion of symptomatic lesions (sensitivity 0·92 [0·87-0·96], specificity 0·31 [0·23-0·40], AUC 0·62 [0·57-0·66]) or cortical lesions (sensitivity 0·92 [0·87-0·95], specificity 0·32 [0·24-0·41], AUC 0·62 [0·57-0·67]). Requirement of three periventricular lesions resulted in slightly lower sensitivity (0·85 [0·78-0·90], slightly higher specificity (0·40 [0·32-0·50], and similar AUC (0·63 [0·57-0·68]). Inclusion of optic nerve evaluation resulted in similar sensitivity (0·92 [0·87-0·96]), and slightly lower specificity (0·26 [0·18-0·34]) and AUC (0·59 [0·55-0·64]). AUC values were also similar for DIT (2010 McDonald 0·61 [0·55-0·67] and 2016 MAGNIMS 0·61 [0·55-0·66]) and DIS plus DIT (0·62 [0·56-0·67] and 0·64 [0·58-0·69]).INTERPRETATION: The 2016 MAGNIMS criteria showed similar accuracy to the 2010 McDonald criteria in predicting the development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Inclusion of symptomatic lesions is expected to simplify the clinical use of MRI criteria without reducing accuracy, and our findings suggest that needing three lesions to define periventricular involvement might slightly increase specificity, suggesting that these two factors could be considered during further revisions of multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria.FUNDING: UK MS Society, National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Dutch MS Research Foundation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Performance of the 2001, 2010, and 2017 international McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, the 2016 MRI in multiple sclerosis (MAGNIMS) criteria, and our 2011 proposed (Verhey) criteria were determined; performance was adjudicated with generalised linear models.FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2004, and June 30, 2017, we included 324 participants with median follow-up of 72 months (range 6-150), 71 (22%) participants with multiple sclerosis, 237 (73%) with monophasic acquired demyelinating syndrome, 14 (4%) with relapsing non-multiple sclerosis, and two (1%) with alternative diagnoses. We scored 2391 brain, 444 spinal, and 67 dedicated orbital MRI scans. One or more T1 hypointense lesions plus one or more periventricular lesions (Verhey criteria) best predicted multiple sclerosis outcome. Performance of the 2017 McDonald criteria was comparable to the 2010 McDonald criteria and was easier to adjudicate. The ability of CSF oligoclonal bands to substitute for the requirement for both enhancing and non-enhancing lesions in the 2017 McDonald criteria improved its performance compared with the 2010 criteria. Myelin oligodendrocyte testing at baseline did not improve performance of the 2017 McDonald criteria.INTERPRETATION: The 2017 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, as applied at the time of incident attack, perform well in identifying children and youth with multiple sclerosis, indicating that the same diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis apply across the age span. The presence of so-called black holes on MRI and periventricular lesions at baseline (Verhey criteria) also effectively distinguish children with multiple sclerosis from children with monophasic demyelination. The presence of CSF oligoclonal bands improve diagnostic accuracy. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies identify children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and those with relapsing non-multiple sclerosis, most of whom do not meet 2017 McDonald criteria at onset.FUNDING: The Multiple Sclerosis Scientific Research Foundation and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to evaluate the reliability of CL detection on DIR longitudinally at multiple subsequent time-points applying the MAGNIMs scoring criteria for CLs.METHODS: 26 MS patients received a 3T-MRI (Siemens, Skyra) with DIR at 12 time-points (TP) within a 16 months period. Scans were assessed in random order by two different raters. Both raters separately marked all CLs on each scan and total lesion numbers were obtained for each scan-TP and patient. After a retrospective re-evaluation, the number of consensus CLs (conL) was defined as the total number of CLs, which both raters finally agreed on. CLs volumes, relative signal intensities and CLs localizations were determined. Both ratings (conL vs. non-consensus scoring) were compared for further analysis.RESULTS: A total number of n = 334 CLs were identified by both raters in 26 MS patients with a first agreement of both raters on 160 out of 334 of the CLs found (κ = 0.48). After the retrospective re-evaluation, consensus agreement increased to 233 out of 334 CL (κ = 0.69). 93.8% of conL were visible in at least 2 consecutive TP. 74.7% of the conL were visible in all 12 consecutive TP. ConL had greater mean lesion volumes and higher mean signal intensities compared to lesions that were only detected by one of the raters (p<0.05). A higher number of CLs in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobe were identified by both raters than the number of those only identified by one of the raters (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: After a first assessment, slightly less than a half of the CL were considered as reliably detectable on longitudinal DIR images. A retrospective re-evaluation notably increased the consensus agreement. However, this finding is narrowed, considering the fact that retrospective evaluation steps might not be practicable in clinical routine. Lesions that were not reliably identifiable by both raters seem to be characterized by lower signal intensity and smaller size, or located in distinct anatomical brain regions."}]},{"title":"yesno","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"SATB1 is a homeodomain protein and is predominantly expressed in thymocytes.

Previous studies demonstrated that MAR sequences augment transcription of the linked reporter luciferase gene. Here, we show that SATB1 dramatically reduces the high levels of MAR-linked luciferase gene transcription. Transcription was virtually abolished for a reporter gene surrounded by two MARs at the 5' and 3' ends of the gene, which otherwise confer the highest level of transcriptional augmentation. On the other hand, SATB1 did not affect expression of an AT-rich non-MAR-linked luciferase gene or of endogenous housekeeping genes.

We aimed to investigate the link between seizure and SLE utilizing a large sample of subjects and extensive data analysis.METHODS: Patients with SLE were compared with age- and sex-matched controls regarding the prevalence of epilepsy in a cross-sectional study. Chi-square and t tests were used for univariate analysis and a logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The study was performed utilizing the medical database of Clalit Health Services.RESULTS: The study included 5,018 patients with SLE and 25,090 age- and gender-frequency-matched controls. The proportion of epilepsy was found significantly higher among SLE patients (4.03 vs. 0.87%, p < 0.001). Using logistic regression, adjusting for multiple confounding factors, older age (≥70 years) resulted as negative predictor (OR 0.42 [95% CI 0.27-0.62], p <0.001), whereas the presence of SLE was a positive predictor of epilepsy (OR 4.70 [95% CI 3.94-5.82], p < 0.001). Interaction between SLE and elderly age resulted in high OR of 5.47 for epilepsy (95% CI 2.53-11.9).CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the higher prevalence of epilepsy in SLE patients.

We identified two hydrophobic peptides (peptides #1 and #2) within MHV-A59 S2 as possible fusion domains. This was based on hydrophobicity, conservation among coronavirus S proteins and the prediction of a sided helix conformation. Using site directed mutagenesis and an in vitro cell to cell fusion assay we showed that substitution of hydrophobic amino acids with charged amino acids, within the predicted hydrophobic face of either of these two peptides eliminated fusion. Within peptide #1 substitution of the same hydrophobic amino acids with other hydrophobic amino acids or substitution of polar amino acids with charged or polar amino acids had little effect on fusion. Thus peptides #1 and #2 remain likely candidates for the MHV fusion peptide.

Three protein bands were identical in pI and one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain. Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity, it appears that altered pathogenicity of strains of IBV may be detected by alteration of pI of the proteins.

From a US societal perspective, this analysis models the clinical efficacy and estimates the value-based price (VBP) for erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor.METHODS: A Markov health state transition model was developed to estimate the incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and value-based price range for erenumab in migraine prevention. The model comprises \"on preventive treatment\", \"off preventive treatment\", and \"death\" health states across a 10-year time horizon. The evaluation compared erenumab to no preventive treatment in episodic and chronic migraine patients that have failed at least one preventive therapy. Therapeutic benefits are based on estimated changes in monthly migraine days (MMD) from erenumab pivotal clinical trials and a network meta-analysis of migraine studies. Utilities were estimated using previously published mapping algorithms. A VBP analysis was performed to identify maximum erenumab annual prices at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 per QALY. Estimates of VBP under different scenarios such as choice of different comparators, assumptions around inclusion of placebo effect, and exclusion of work productivity losses were also generated.RESULTS: Erenumab resulted in incremental QALYs of 0.185 vs supportive care (SC) and estimated cost offsets due to reduced MMD of $8,482 over 10 years, with an average duration of treatment of 2.01 years. The estimated VBP at WTP thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 for erenumab compared to SC ranged from $14,238-$23,998. VBP estimates including the placebo effect and excluding work productivity ranged from $7,445-$13,809; increasing to $12,151-$18,589 with onabotulinumtoxinA as a comparator in chronic migraine.CONCLUSION: Erenumab is predicted to reduce migraine-related direct and indirect costs, and increase QALYs compared to SC."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are currently under evaluation for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine: eptinezumab (ALD403), fremanezumab (TEV-48125), galcanezumab (LY2951742), and erenumab (AMG334).

High doses of potassium iodide are effective to block radioiodine thyroid uptake and to prevent development of thyroid cancer years later. However, there are controversies concerning thyroid cancer risk induced by radioiodine exposure in adults. Further, the interaction of nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake is higher than in healthy people.

Here, we report the involvement of Pim kinases expressed through STAT5 activation in acquisition of this resistance. The specific pan-Pim kinase inhibitor AZD1208 as well as PIM447 in combination with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 cooperatively downregulated the mTORC1/4EBP1 pathway, formation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex, and Mcl-1 expression leading to activation of Bak and Bax to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis synergistically in these cells. These cooperative effects were enhanced or inhibited by knock down of mTOR or expression of its activated mutant, respectively. Overexpression of Mcl-1 conferred the resistance on 32D/ITD cells to combined inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway and Pim kinases, while the Mcl-1-specific BH3 mimetic A-1210477 conquered the resistance of MV4-11 cells to GDC-0941. Furthermore, overexpression of Pim-1 in 32D/TKD enhanced the mTORC1/Mcl-1 pathway and partially protected it from the PI3K/Akt inhibitors or the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib to confer the resistance to PI3K/Akt inhibitors.

Notably, the Ba/F3-ITD+D835V cells were the most sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors. Treatment with HSP90 inhibitors downregulated FLT3 and its downstream signaling and induced G1 arrest followed by apoptosis in Ba/F3-ITD+N676K, Ba/F3-ITD+F691L, Ba/F3-ITD+Y842C, and especially Ba/F3-ITD+D835V cells at lower concentrations compared with Ba/F3-ITD cells. The downregulation of FLT3-ITD+D835V was caused by rapid proteolysis in autophagy.

However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in the clinic."}]},{"title":"yesno","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"n this study, we found that thymoquinone (TQ) could mitigate intestinal damages induced by irradiation.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the examination method of choice for evaluating radiation-induced brain complications. The purpose of this report is to describe the spectrum of MRI abnormalities detected in a group of survivors of leukemia treated with cranial irradiation.PROCEDURES: In this cross-sectional, single center study, 56 patients (median age at follow-up 19 years) receiving CRT as cranial prophylaxis (CP) included in the leukemia protocol (total dose 1,800-2,400 cGy) and/or in the total body irradiation regimen (990-1,200 cGy) before hematopoietic stem cell transplant, were evaluated by MRI after a median interval of 11 years (range 2-27) following CRT.RESULTS: Fifty-nine MRI abnormalities (32 cavernomas, nine focal areas of gliosis, seven dystrophic mineralizations, five cerebral atrophies, four pituitary atrophies, one diffuse radiation leukoencephalopathy, and one meningioma) were found in 43 patients. The longest interval between CRT and MRI and oldest age at follow-up represented the two risk factors that were statistically associated with MRI lesions (P = 0.032 and 0.033, respectively). Cerebral cavernomas (CC) were the most frequent MRI abnormalities (57%). All patients with CC were asymptomatic at diagnosis and during follow-up, except one who had aspecific neurological manifestations and micro hemorrhages.CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that total doses and modalities of fractionation dose of CRT were not significantly associated with MRI abnormalities.

Furthermore, the upward trends of increases in a variety of other tumors including breast cancer, cancers of central nervous system and renal cancer have been reported in the persons exposed to Chornobyl fallout. There is growing evidence that insufficient apoptosis allows irradiated cells to survive and thereby contributes to carcinogenesis. The purpose of the present survey is to summarize the recent findings related to apoptotic biomarkers among cancer patients from the different populations affected by the Chornobyl catastrophe.

Several genes and/or proteins controlling apoptosis directly or indirectly have been incorporated into the analysis. The data reviewed here provide a mechanistic link between the apoptosis alterations and development of radiation-related cancer in the 30-year post-Chornobyl period.

Any of these mutations were identified in 4.4% of the breast cancer patients, 26.4% of the ovarian cancer patients and 0.5% of the controls. In the breast cancer patients, BRCA1 mutations were strongly associated with earlier age at diagnosis, with oestrogen receptor (ER) negative tumours and with a first-degree family history of breast cancer, although only 35% of the identified BRCA1 mutation carriers had such a family history. There were no marked differences in the regional distribution of BRCA1 mutations, so that the significant differences in age at diagnosis and family history of breast cancer patients from areas afflicted by the Chernobyl accident could not be explained by BRCA1. We next observed a higher impact and a shifted mutational spectrum of BRCA1 in the series of Byelorussian ovarian cancer patients where the three founder mutations accounted for 26.4% (53/201). While the Cys61Gly mutation appeared underrepresented in ovarian cancer as compared with breast cancer cases from the same population (p = 0.01), the 4153delA mutation made a higher contribution to ovarian cancer than to breast cancer (p < 0.01). BRCA1 mutations were significantly enriched among ovarian cancer cases with a first-degree family history of breast or ovarian cancer, whereas the median age at ovarian cancer diagnosis was not different between mutation carriers and non-carriers.

Irradiated cells also show genomic instability, as do adjacent non-irradiated cells (the bystander effect); the importance to carcinogenesis remains to be established. Current knowledge of radiation effects is largely dependent on evidence from exposure to atomic bomb whole body radiation, leading to increases in a wide range of malignancies. In contrast, millions of people were exposed to radioactive isotopes in the fallout from the Chernobyl accident, within the first 20 years there was a large increase in thyroid carcinoma incidence and a possible radiation-related increase in breast cancer, but as yet there is no general increase in malignancies. The increase in thyroid carcinoma, attributable to the very large amounts of iodine 131 released, was first noticed in children with a strong relationship between young age at exposure and risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The extent of the increase, the reasons for the relationship to age at exposure, the reduction in attributable fraction with increasing latency and the role of environmental factors are discussed. The large number of radiation-induced PTCs has allowed new observations. The subtype and molecular findings change with latency; most early cases were solid PTCs with RET-PTC3 rearrangements, later cases were classical PTCs with RET-PTC1 rearrangements. Small numbers of many other RET rearrangements have occurred in 'Chernobyl' PTCs, and also rearrangement of BRAF. Five of the N-terminal genes found in papillary carcinoma rearrangements are also involved in rearrangements in hematological malignancies; three are putative tumor suppressor genes, and two are further genes fused to RET in PTCs. Radiation causes double-strand breaks; the rearrangements common in these radiation-induced tumors reflect their etiology. It is suggested that oncogenic rearrangements may commonly involve both a tumor-suppressor gene (or a DNA repair gene) as well as an oncogene. Involvement of two relevant genes would give a greater chance of progression and a shorter latency than a single-gene mutation. More information is needed on germline mutations conferring susceptibility to radiation-induced PTCs, particularly DNA repair genes. The radiation exposure to the fallout after Chernobyl was very different from the whole body radiation after the atomic bombs. The type and molecular pathology of the thyroid tumors is changing with increasing latency, long latency tumors in other organs could occur in the future.

To determine whether Gli1 was sufficient to enhance NSC proliferation, we overexpressed this mitogen and were surprised to find that Gli1 resulted in decreased proliferation, accumulation of NSCs in the G2/M phase of cell cycle, and apoptosis. In contrast, Gli1-expressing lineage-restricted neural precursors demonstrated a 4.5-fold proliferation enhancement. Expression analyses of Gli1-expressing NSCs identified significant induction of Gadd45a and decreased cyclin A2 and Stag1 mRNA, genes involved in the G2-M transition and apoptosis. Furthermore, Gadd45a overexpression was sufficient to partially recapitulate the Gli1-induced G2/M accumulation and cell death of NSCs. In contrast to normal stem cells, tumor-derived stem cells had markedly higher basal Gli1 expression and did not undergo apoptosis with further elevation of Gli1. Our data suggest that Gli1-induced apoptosis may serve as a protective mechanism against premature mitosis and may give insight into mechanisms by which nonmalignant stem cells restrain hyperproliferation in the context of potentially transforming mitogenic signals. Tumor-derived stem cells apparently lack these mechanisms, which may contribute to their unrestrained proliferation and malignant potential."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Finally, we show that Nanog physically interacts with the cohesin or cohesin interacting proteins STAG1 and WAPL further substantiating this association.","answer_start":1193}],"question":"What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?","id":"5d35dfbdb3a638076300000b_013","is_impossible":false}],"context":"For self-renewal, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require the expression of specific transcription factors accompanied by a particular chromosome organization to maintain a balance between pluripotency and the capacity for rapid differentiation. However, how transcriptional regulation is linked to chromosome organization in ESCs is not well understood. Here we show that the cohesin component RAD21 exhibits a functional role in maintaining ESC identity through association with the pluripotency transcriptional network. ChIP-seq analyses of RAD21 reveal an ESC specific cohesin binding pattern that is characterized by CTCF independent co-localization of cohesin with pluripotency related transcription factors Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Esrrb and Klf4. Upon ESC differentiation, most of these binding sites disappear and instead new CTCF independent RAD21 binding sites emerge, which are enriched for binding sites of transcription factors implicated in early differentiation. Furthermore, knock-down of RAD21 causes expression changes that are similar to expression changes after Nanog depletion, demonstrating the functional relevance of the RAD21--pluripotency transcriptional network association. Finally, we show that Nanog physically interacts with the cohesin or cohesin interacting proteins STAG1 and WAPL further substantiating this association.

Other late effects have also been identified, such as pulmonary dysfunction, endocrinopathies (thyroid dysfunction, infertility), neck muscle atrophy, and persistent fatigue. HL survivors have two- to fourfold increased risks to develop SMNs and CVD compared with the general population. With respect to SMNs, radiotherapy is associated with 1.5- to 15-fold increased risk of solid malignancies. The relative risk (RR) of solid tumors increases steadily with increasing follow-up time from 5 to 15 years since radiotherapy, and remains elevated for at least 40 years. The RR of solid SMNs increases strongly with younger age at first treatment. Risks of lung, breast, and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers increase with higher radiation dose. Alkylating agent chemotherapy, especially procarbazine, does not only increase risk of leukemia but also of solid malignancies, in particular, cancers of the lung and GI tract. In contrast, gonadotoxic chemotherapy decreases the risk of radiation-associated breast cancer, through induction of premature menopause. Smoking appears to multiply the radiation- and chemotherapy-associated risks of lung cancer. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for HL may cause cardiovascular toxicity. Radiotherapy increases the risk of coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure (HF), and pericarditis, whereas anthracycline-containing chemotherapy increases the risks of HF and valvular heart disease. Cardiovascular toxicity following radiotherapy is usually observed from 5 to at least 35 years after therapy, whereas anthracycline-related toxicity is already observed during treatment, up to at least 25 years. The joint effects of anthracyclines, radiotherapy, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, smoking, and physical inactivity) appear to be additive rather than multiplicative.

Screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) may allow detection of early stage, resectable cancers. We developed a Markov decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model to estimate the merits of annual LDCT screening among HL survivors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Population databases and HL-specific literature informed key model parameters, including lung cancer rates and stage distribution, cause-specific survival estimates, and utilities. Relative risks accounted for radiation therapy (RT) technique, smoking status (>10 pack-years or current smokers vs not), age at HL diagnosis, time from HL treatment, and excess radiation from LDCTs. LDCT assumptions, including expected stage-shift, false-positive rates, and likely additional workup were derived from the National Lung Screening Trial and preliminary results from an internal phase 2 protocol that performed annual LDCTs in 53 HL survivors. We assumed a 3% discount rate and a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).RESULTS: Annual LDCT screening was cost effective for all smokers. A male smoker treated with mantle RT at age 25 achieved maximum QALYs by initiating screening 12 years post-HL, with a life expectancy benefit of 2.1 months and an incremental cost of $34,841/QALY. Among nonsmokers, annual screening produced a QALY benefit in some cases, but the incremental cost was not below the WTP threshold for any patient subsets. As age at HL diagnosis increased, earlier initiation of screening improved outcomes. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the model was most sensitive to the lung cancer incidence and mortality rates and expected stage-shift from screening.CONCLUSIONS: HL survivors are an important high-risk population that may benefit from screening, especially those treated in the past with large radiation fields including mantle or involved-field RT. Screening may be cost effective for all smokers but possibly not for nonsmokers despite a small life expectancy benefit.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Despite their utility, balancer chromosomes are rarely used in mice because they are difficult to generate using conventional methods. Here we describe the engineering of a mouse balancer chromosome with the Cre-loxP recombination system. The chromosome features a 24-centiMorgan (cM) inversion between Trp53 (also known as p53) and Wnt3 on mouse chromosome 11 that is recessive lethal and dominantly marked with a K14-Agouti transgene. When allelic to a wild-type chromosome, the inversion suppresses crossing over in the inversion interval, accompanied by elevated recombination in the flanking regions. The inversion functions as a balancer chromosome because it can be used to maintain a lethal mutation in the inversion interval as a self-sustaining trans-heterozygous stock. This strategy can be used to generate similar genetic reagents throughout the mouse genome. Engineering of visibly marked inversions and deficiencies is an important step toward functional analyses of the mouse genome and will facilitate large-scale mutagenesis programs."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"This problem is of particular importance when the mutant allele has been maintained with a balancer chromosome.","answer_start":1402}],"question":"What are Drosophila's balancer chromosomes?","id":"5d35e114b3a638076300000c_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Multiple sub-vital effects, here designated as reductions in fitness S1-S5, for the second chromosome gene 'daughterless' (da) of Drosophila melanogaster were described as (S1) a recessive maternal lethality for daughters, (S2) a reduced fertility of da/da females, (S3) a recessive sub-vital zygotic effect, (S4) a recessive female-specific zygotic effect and (S5) a recessive maternal interaction effect on sons. (For S1-3 see also: Bell, 1954; Sandler, 1972; Cline, 1976). These five distinct effects were initially quantified from estimates of viability in single generation crossing experiments. Dynamic estimates of these fitness parameters were obtained by fitting the elimination rate of da from a series of large random mating cage populations to a recurrence equation by the method of minimum chi-square. The stability of these estimates discerns those effects which are truly pleiotropic versus those due to linked genes. The dynamic estimates supported only S1 and S4 effects. Evidence for S2 and S5 was indeterminate, but the S3 effect was rejected (P less than 0.01). The observed reduction in fitness, supposedly due to this recessive zygotic effect for da, was most likely the result of linked deleterious genes. These results indicate that pleiotropic vital effects observed in single generation test-cross matings may be caused by linked genes rather than the specific mutant per se. This problem is of particular importance when the mutant allele has been maintained with a balancer chromosome. Experiments on the rescue of daughters from da/da mothers with low temperatures during embryogenesis and with dechorionation of eggs were described in which the findings failed to confirm previously reported actions of the da gene. Modifying genes rather than environmental variables were cited as the probable cause for these conflicting results."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"From four isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster, four sets of recombinant extracted lines were constructed using standard balancer-chromosome techniques","answer_start":496}],"question":"What are Drosophila's balancer chromosomes?","id":"5d35e114b3a638076300000c_003","is_impossible":false}],"context":"A model for the evolution of senescence known as \"antagonistic pleiotropy\" makes the specific prediction that there should be a negative genetic correlation between early- and late-age traits associated with fitness. This model has previously been tested by classical quantitative-genetic means including sib-analysis and artificial selection. We used the approach of chromosome extraction, which has both advantages and disadvantages compared to classical techniques, to test the model further. From four isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster, four sets of recombinant extracted lines were constructed using standard balancer-chromosome techniques. The four parental lines and 53 recombinants were reared under controlled laboratory conditions and isolated as pairs for scoring daily fecundity and longevity. Even though the design is not optimal for estimating classical components of genetic variance, it afforded a uniquely direct test of the magnitude of environmental covariances, while giving a detailed genetic picture of part of the genome. There were clear differences among the recombinant series in the distribution of mean longevity and early fecundity. The genetic correlation between early fecundity (sum of egg production for the first five days posteclosion) and female longevity was significantly negative in only one of the recombinant series. When all lines were considered together, the phenotypic correlation between these traits was significantly negative (P < 0.02), while the broad-sense genetic correlation was -0.219 (P < 0.11).

We accessed the population-based databases of Manitoba Health (single provincial health insurer) to get age-, gender-, and geography-matched non-IBD controls (n = 310). We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure serum antibodies.RESULTS: Seropositivity for measles and mumps was similar in controls (98.1%, 78.4%, respectively) as in CD (96.2%, 72.3% respectively) and in UC (95.5%, 74.6%, respectively).

Typically, the disease is characterized by a two-phase course. After an average incubation period of 8 to 11 days, initial symptoms such as fever, cough, coryza and conjunctivitis appear. Two thirds of the patients shows a white-marked enanthema on the buccal mucosa (Koplik's spots). After disappearance of these symptoms, a second increase of temperature and the typical measles exanthema, a brownish-red maculopapular rash, appear. Infection with measles virus induces transient immunodeficiency that favours the formation of several complications. Some of them, e. g. encephalitic diseases, are severe and associated with a high mortality. Measles are world-wide distributed and belong to the ten most frequent infectious diseases in some less developed countries. The disease is associated with a high mortality in some African and South-East Asian countries, in particular in children aged less than 12 months. Of particular note, measles are the most important cause of blindness in children in population with borderline vitamin A status. In Germany, the number of reported measles cases has been declined dramatically since the introduction of a vaccine more than four decades ago. However, regional outbreaks or small epidemics still occur. Because there is no specific antiviral treatment, therapy of measles is symptomatic and depends on the manifestation of the disease. The most important prevention strategy is immunization with a life-attenuated vaccine that can be applied as monovaccination or in combination with mumps and rubella virus (MMR vaccination) or mumps, rubella and varicella virus (MMRV vaccination)."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Mumps is a Paramyxoviridae virus.

This disease was rampant prior to introduction of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, resulting in decreased incidence. This disease has demonstrated several outbreaks.OBJECTIVE: This review provides a focused evaluation of mumps, an update on outbreaks, management recommendations, and ways to decrease transmission.DISCUSSION: Clusters of mumps outbreaks continue to occur. The virus is a paramyxovirus, a single-stranded RNA virus. The vaccine can provide lifelong immunity if administered properly, though prior to 1967 and introduction of the vaccine, the virus was common. In the past decade, there have been several notable outbreaks. Humans are the only known hosts, with disease spread through exposure to droplets and saliva. Factors affecting transmission include age, compromised immunity, time of year, travel, and vaccination status. Upper respiratory symptoms, fever, and headache are common, with unilateral or bilateral parotitis, and the virus may spread to other systems. Diagnosis is clinical, though polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin testing are available. This review provides several recommendations for vaccine in pregnancy, patients living in close quarters, health care personnel, and those immunocompromised. Treatment is generally supportive, with emphasis on proper isolation to prevent widespread outbreaks. Although reporting regulations and procedures vary by state, mumps is reportable in most states.CONCLUSIONS: Mumps is an easily spread virus. Although vaccination is the most effective way to prevent transmission, early recognition of the disease is crucial. As an emergency physician, it is important to recognize the clinical presentation, recommended testing, treatment, and isolation procedures.Published by Elsevier Inc."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Since chronic paramyxovirus infection with measles is known to be accompanied by increased production of antiviral antibodies","answer_start":420}],"question":"List 3 human diseases caused by  viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae.","id":"5e4163b848dab47f2600000f_004","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a common skeletal disorder characterised by focal abnormalities of increased and disorganised bone turnover. Genetic factors play a central role in the pathogenesis of PDB but environmental factors also contribute. Measles virus (MV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) have all been implicated as potential disease triggers but the data are conflicting. Since chronic paramyxovirus infection with measles is known to be accompanied by increased production of antiviral antibodies, we have analysed circulating concentrations of antibodies to MV, CDV, and RSV as well as mumps, rubella and varicella zoster virus (VZV) in 463 patients with PDB and 220 aged and gender-matched controls. We also studied the relation between viral antibody concentrations and various markers of disease severity and extent in 460 PDB patients. A high proportion of cases and controls tested positive for antiviral antibodies but there was no significant difference in circulating antibody concentrations between PDB cases and controls for MV, CDV, RSV, rubella or VZV. However, mumps virus antibody levels were significantly higher in the PDB cases (mean ± SD = 3.1 ± 0.84 vs. 2.62 ± 0.86. p < 0.001). There was no association between disease severity and circulating antibody concentrations to any of the viruses. In conclusion, we found no evidence to suggest that PDB is associated with abnormalities of immune response to measles or other paramyxoviruses, although there was evidence of a greater antibody response to mumps.

NiV infected endothelial cells generated a functionally robust IFN-beta response, which correlated with localization of the NiV W protein to the cytoplasm. There was no antiviral response detected in infected neuronal cells. NiV infection of endothelial cells induced a significant increase in secreted inflammatory chemokines, which corresponded with the increased ability of infected cell supernatants to induce monocyte and T-lymphocyte chemotaxis.

Aβ is produced from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) followed by γ-secretase. Verubecestat is an oral BACE-1 inhibitor that reduces the Aβ level in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 78-week trial to evaluate verubecestat at doses of 12 mg and 40 mg per day, as compared with placebo, in patients who had a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The coprimary outcomes were the change from baseline to week 78 in the score on the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog; scores range from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating worse dementia) and in the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory scale (ADCS-ADL; scores range from 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating worse function).RESULTS: A total of 1958 patients underwent randomization; 653 were randomly assigned to receive verubecestat at a dose of 12 mg per day (the 12-mg group), 652 to receive verubecestat at a dose of 40 mg per day (the 40-mg group), and 653 to receive matching placebo.

Using a selective NKB receptor (NK3R) antagonist, the role of NKB in the hypergonadotropic state in menopausal women was explored.METHODS: Eleven postmenopausal women were administered the NK3R antagonist MLE4901 at 40 mg twice daily orally for 7 days. Ten-minute blood sampling for 8 h was performed before and on the last day of NK3R antagonist treatment for luteinising hormone (LH) pulsatility analysis with kisspeptin-10 (0.3 µg/kg i.v. bolus) administered at 6 h on both days. Hot flash frequency and severity were self-reported for 7 days before and during NK3R antagonist administration.RESULTS: LH fell from 29.3 ± 4.1 to 24.4 ± 3.8 IU/L (p < 0.05) after 7 days of NK3R antagonist treatment, with no change in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Basal (non-pulsatile) LH secretion was reduced (549.0 ± 70.8 vs. 366.1 ± 92.1 IU/L/6 h, p = 0.006), and while the LH pulse frequency did not change in the group as a whole (from 0.8 ± 0.1 to 0.7 ± 0.1 pulses/h, ns), it did fall in the 8 women with hot flashes (from 1.0 ± 0.1 to 0.7 ± 0.1 pulses/h, p < 0.05).

We have used an enhancer trap to determine whether other glucocorticoid-regulated genes exist in AtT-20 cells. An enhancer trap is a recombinant construction containing a selectable marker driven by a promoter that has been weakened by removal of its enhancers so that the transfected trap is only expressed if it comes under the influence of an endogenous enhancer. For a selectable marker, we used a fusion gene coding for hygromycin phosphotransferase (Hy) and herpes simplex thymidine kinase. Thus, expression of this gene conferred hygromycin resistance and ganciclovir sensitivity. Suppression resulted in ganciclovir resistance and hygromycin sensitivity. An enhancerless promoter was produced using a truncated, transcriptionally inactive, form of the POMC promoter. AtT-20/D1 cells were transfected with this construct and cultured in medium containing hygromycin to kill any cells not expressing the Hy gene. The survivors were cultured in medium containing ganciclovir and dexamethasone and cloned. Clones in which the transgene was down-regulated by dexamethasone survived and were designated AtT-20/NET (for negative enhancer trap). Northern blot analysis confirmed that the transgene was down-regulated by dexamethasone as expected and that in at least one instance, suppression of the transgene was more complete than suppression of the full-length POMC promoter. Southern blot analysis after restriction enzyme digestion showed that each cell clone contained a single copy of the transgene, and PCR analysis of the promoter region showed that insertion had occurred in two unique sites in at least two cell clones. Another plasmid construct was prepared that contained the selectable gene but lacked any promoter elements. After transfection of AtT-20 cells with this vector, up-regulated enhancers were trapped by selection in hygromycin and dexamethasone followed by ganciclovir alone and designated AtT-20/PET cells (for positive enhancer trap). Up-regulation of the selectable gene in AtT-20/PET cells was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of dexamethasone-treated cells. In summary, glucocorticoid-regulated enhancers have been identified in AtT-20/D1 cells by an enhancer trap strategy that uses sequential selection under conditions that test whether the transgene is active.

To understand whether the transcriptional regulatory activities of E1a are related to its ras cooperation activity, we generated a series of mutant E1a expression vectors by linker insertion mutagenesis of the 289-amino-acid protein. Here we describe a new class of mutants which although defective for enhancer repression still can cooperate with the ras oncogene in cell transformation. The mutants are also defective in transcription transactivation. Our data suggest that enhancer repression and transformation via ras cooperation are separate E1a functions and that cooperation with ras does not rely on either of the RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory functions of E1a. We also show that mutations which inactivate enhancer repression are not confirmed to a single critical domain necessary for repression.

MSC alone at 3 days post-cisplatin, after renal functional deficits were obvious, significantly improved 7-day survival of animals. Survival was further improved by pFUS and MSC. pFUS prior to MSC injections increased IL-10 production by MSC that homed to kidneys and generated an anti-inflammatory immune cell profile in treated kidneys.

Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed during the first course. BRAF aberrations in tumor tissue were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization.Results: Thirty-eight eligible subjects were enrolled. Dose levels 1 and 2 (33 and 43 mg/m2/dose b.i.d.) were excessively toxic. DLTs included grade 3 elevated amylase/lipase (n = 1), headache (n = 1), mucositis (n = 2), and grades 2-3 rash (n = 6). At dose level 0 (25 mg/m2/dose b.i.d, the RP2D), only 3 of 24 subjects experienced DLTs (elevated amylase/lipase, rash, and mucositis). At the R2PD, the median (range) area under the curve (AUC0-∞) and apparent oral clearance of selumetinib were 3855 ng*h/mL (1780 to 7250 ng × h/mL) and 6.5 L × h-1 × m-2 (3.4 to 14.0 L × h-1 × m-2), respectively. Thirteen of 19 tumors had BRAF abnormalities. Among the 5 (20%) of 25 subjects with sustained partial responses, all at the RP2D, 4 had BRAF aberrations, 1 had insufficient tissue. Subjects received a median of 13 cycles (range: 1-26). Fourteen (37%) completed all protocol treatment (26 cycles [n = 13], 13 cycles [n = 1]) with at least stable disease; 2-year progression-free survival at the RP2D was 69 ± SE 9.8%.Conclusion: Selumetinib has promising antitumor activity in children with LGG.

In part 2, men received placebo or 20, 60, or 180 mg each day for 10 days. In part 3, women received placebo or 20, 60, or 180 mg each day for 21 days, where dosing was initiated on day 3 ± 2 after menses.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics on circulating levels of LH, FSH, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone, in addition to physiological biomarkers of endometrial thickening, follicle growth, and the duration of the menstrual cycle were evaluated.RESULTS: ESN364 was well-tolerated and rapidly bioavailable with linear pharmacokinetics and no drug accumulation with repeated, daily oral administration. Drug treatment dose-dependently decreased basal LH, but not FSH, and consequently decreased estradiol and progesterone (in women) as well as testosterone (in men). The hormonal changes in women corresponded to delayed ovulation, decreased endometrial thickening, impeded follicular maturation, and prolongation of the menstrual cycle. Drug effects were rapidly reversible.CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of the NK3R antagonist, ESN364, suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in healthy volunteers by selective modulation of gonadotropin secretion, leading to a restrained decrease in ovarian hormone levels in women. These results suggest that ESN364 may offer therapeutic benefit in the treatment of women's health disorders with a mitigated risk of menopausal-like adverse events."}]},{"title":"yesno","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a widely expressed pattern recognition receptor critical for innate immunity.

TLR2 is also a key regulator of mucosal immunity implicated in the development of allergic disease. TLR2 activators are found in many common foods, but the role of TLR2 in oral tolerance and allergic sensitization to foods is not well understood.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts of TLR2 expression and TLR2 activation on oral tolerance to food antigens in a murine model.METHODS: Mice were fed ovalbumin (OVA) or peanut butter with or without the addition of low doses of TLR2 activators Pam3 CSK4 or FSL-1. Oral tolerance was assessed by analysing antibody responses after a systemic antigen challenge. OVA-specific Tregs were assessed in the Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen in wild-type and TLR2(-/-) mice. Low-dose Pam3 CSK4 was also tested as an oral adjuvant.RESULTS: Oral tolerance was successfully induced in both wild-type and TLR2(-/-) recipient mice, with an associated regulatory T-cell response. Oral TLR2 activation, with low-dose Pam3 CSK4 or FSL-1, during oral antigen exposure was found to alter oral tolerance and was associated with the development of substantial IgE and IgA responses to foods upon systemic challenge. Low-dose oral Pam3 CSK4 treatment also selectively enhanced antigen-specific IgA responses to oral antigen exposure.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: TLR2 is not necessary for oral tolerance induction, but oral TLR2 activation modulates humoral IgE and IgA responses during tolerance development. Low-dose Pam3 CSK4 is also an effective oral adjuvant that selectively enhances IgA production. These observations are pertinent to the optimization of oral allergen immunotherapy and oral vaccine development.© 2015 The Authors.

We observed a global decrease in K27me3 in as little as 3 days after differentiation of mouse ES cells induced by retinoic acid (RA) treatment. The global levels of the histone K27 methyltransferase EZH2 also decreased with RA treatment. A loss of EZH2 binding and K27me3 was observed locally on PRC2 target genes induced after 3 days of RA, including Nestin. In contrast, direct RA-responsive genes that are rapidly induced, such as Hoxa1, showed a loss of EZH2 binding and K27me3 after only a few hours of RA treatment. Following differentiation induced by leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) withdrawal without RA, Hoxa1 was not transcriptionally activated. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of EZH2 resulted in loss of K27me3 during LIF withdrawal, but the Hoxa1 gene remained transcriptionally silent after loss of this repressive mark. Induction of histone hyperacetylation overrode the repressive K27me3 modification and resulted in Hoxa1 gene expression. Together, these data show that there are multiple temporal phases of derepression of PRC2 target genes during ES cell differentiation and that other epigenetic marks (specifically, increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4), in addition to derepression, are important for gene-specific transcriptional activation.

We show that gene repression is tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3 levels.

In a reciprocal experiment, we examine the effect loss of PRC2 has on the placement of DNAme. In contrast to the global antagonism DNAme has on the placement of H3K27me3, loss of H3K27me3 has a modest effect on DNAme, with only 4% of genes undergoing changes in DNAme, including 861 showing increases and 552 showing losses of overall DNAme.

Candidate and genome-wide RNA expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of Ezh2(NK) heart identified genes directly repressed by EZH2. Among these were the potent cell cycle inhibitors Ink4a/b (inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 A and B), the upregulation of which was associated with decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation in Ezh2(NK). EZH2-repressed genes were enriched for transcriptional regulators of noncardiomyocyte expression programs such as Pax6, Isl1, and Six1. EZH2 was also required for proper spatiotemporal regulation of cardiac gene expression, because Hcn4, Mlc2a, and Bmp10 were inappropriately upregulated in ventricular RNA. PRC2 was also required later in heart development, as indicated by cardiomyocyte-restricted TNT-Cre inactivation of the PRC2 subunit Eed. However, Ezh2 inactivation by TNT-Cre did not cause an overt phenotype, likely because of functional redundancy with Ezh1. Thus, early Ezh2 inactivation by Nk2-5(Cre) caused later disruption of cardiomyocyte gene expression and heart development.CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a previously undescribed role of EZH2 in regulating heart formation and shows that perturbation of the epigenetic landscape early in cardiogenesis has sustained disruptive effects at later developmental stages."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"We found that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me2/me3), binds to its own site of methylation.","answer_start":743}],"question":"Which epigenetic mark is deposited by PRC2?","id":"5d35ef017bc3fee31f000001_008","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Maintenance of gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA- and histone-methylation is essential for preserving cellular identity and function. Multiplication of eukaryotic cells requires that the DNA content of the cell is duplicated through replication, which is coupled to incorporation of de novo synthesized core histones into nucleosomal structures. One of the challenging questions in biology is to explain how the organism ensures that regulatory epigenetic marks, once established, are transferred from one cell generation to the next. Based on studies in our laboratory, we have recently proposed a model for how the methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) can be stably transmitted through the cell division cycle. We found that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me2/me3), binds to its own site of methylation. Moreover, our results suggested that maintenance of transcriptional repression by PRC2 requires the binding of the PRC2 complex to H3K27me3/me2.

A key question that remains unresolved about this process is how epigenetic marks are transmitted to the next cell generation during cell division. Here we provide a model to explain how trimethylated Lys 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3), which is catalysed by the EZH2-containing Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), is maintained in proliferating cells. We show that the PRC2 complex binds to the H3K27me3 mark and colocalizes with this mark in G1 phase and with sites of ongoing DNA replication. Efficient binding requires an intact trimeric PRC2 complex containing EZH2, EED and SUZ12, but is independent of the catalytic SET domain of EZH2. Using a heterologous reporter system, we show that transient recruitment of the PRC2 complex to chromatin, upstream of the transcriptional start site, is sufficient to maintain repression through endogenous PRC2 during subsequent cell divisions. Thus, we suggest that once the H3K27me3 is established, it recruits the PRC2 complex to maintain the mark at sites of DNA replication, leading to methylation of H3K27 on the daughter strands during incorporation of newly synthesized histones. This mechanism ensures maintenance of the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark in proliferating cells, not only during DNA replication when histones synthesized de novo are incorporated, but also outside S phase, thereby preserving chromatin structure and transcriptional programs."}]},{"title":"list","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Intrinsic disorder (ID), i.e. the lack of a unique folded conformation at physiological conditions, is a common feature for many proteins, which requires specialized biochemical experiments that are not high-throughput.

[(3)H]RO5328673 bound to a single saturable site on hNK2, hNK3 and gpNK3 with high-affinity. RO5328673 acted as an insurmountable antagonist at both human and guinea-pig NK3 receptors in the [(3)H]IP accumulation assay. In binding kinetic analyses, [(3)H]RO5328673 had fast association and dissociation rates at hNK2 while it had a fast association rate and a remarkably slow dissociation rate at gp and hNK3. In electrophysiological recordings of gp SNpc, RO5328673 inhibited the senktide-induced potentiation of spontaneous activity of dopaminergic neurons with an insurmountable mechanism of action. RO5328673 exhibited in-vivo activity in gerbils, robustly reversing the senktide-induced locomotor activity. The TM2 residue gpNK3-A114(2.58) (threonine in all other species) was identified as the critical residue for the RO5328673's slower dissociation kinetics and stronger insurmountable mode of antagonism in the guinea-pig as compared to hNK3-T139(2.58). Using site-directed mutagenesis, [(3)H]RO5328673 binding and rhodopsin-based modeling, the important molecular determinants of the RO5328673-binding pocket of hNK3 were determined.

However, there is a paucity of data available on long-term H treatment of patients. The Rollover Protocol (ROP) Study was conducted to report safety data for patients with HER2-positive locally advanced/metastatic breast and gastric/GEJ cancer who have received long-term H therapy (≥ 5 years and ≥ 3 years for breast and gastric/GEJ cancer, respectively).METHODS: The ROP Study was a single-arm, multicenter, international continuation trial of H in patients who had previously completed a global Roche-sponsored trial with H therapy, had stable disease, and were receiving H at the end of the lead-in trial. Patients with chronic heart failure during the lead-in trial could be included following a risk-benefit analysis. The primary objectives were to provide H therapy to patients with HER2-overexpressing locally advanced/metastatic breast or gastric/GEJ cancer at the end of the lead-in study, and to follow the long-term outcomes and long-term overall safety in these patients.RESULTS: Twenty-five of 69 patients enrolled in the ROP Study received long-term H therapy (19 breast cancer and 6 gastric/GEJ cancer). The median duration of H treatment for patients with breast cancer was 8 years 7 months, and 5 years 2 months for patients with gastric/GEJ cancer. The cardiac status of the patients remained stable over time, with no serious cardiac adverse events or marked changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The median overall worst LVEF measurement was 57.0%, and no patients experienced an LVEF of < 45% (range 47-63%). There were no serious adverse events related to study treatment.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that H has an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated in patients who received long-term H therapy (≥ 5 years and ≥ 3 years for breast and gastric/GEJ cancer, respectively).

Results indicated that Herceptin-inhibited proliferation of breast cancer cell lines overexpressing HER2 (BT474 and MCF/HER2) in 3D culture is abolished by PG. Furthermore, results demonstrated that PG led to the activation of HER2/HER3-mediated signalling. Moreover, PG treatment induced a shift of Herceptin-dependent cell cycle arrest in G1 phase towards S and G2 phases with concomitant upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and downregulation of CDK inhibitor p27Kip1.

However, incomplete penetration into tumors has been noted for those conjugates. Compared to an antibody, peptides may represent an attractive alternative. For HER2, a similar potency has been observed for a 12-amino-acid anti-HER2 peptide mimetic YCDGFYACYMDV-NH2 (AHNP, disulfide-bridged) and full-length trastuzumab. Thus, a peptide, GPLGLAGDDYCDGFYACYMDV-NH2, which consists of AHNP and an MMP-2 cleavable linker GPLGLAGDD, was first designed, followed by conjugation with DOX via a glycine residue at the N-terminus to form a novel DOX-peptide conjugate MAHNP-DOX. Using HER2-positive human breast cancer cells BT474 and SKBR3 as in vitro model systems and nude mice with BT474 xenografts as an in vivo model, this conjugate was comprehensively characterized, and its efficacy was evaluated and compared with that of free DOX. As a result, MAHNP-DOX demonstrated a much lower in vitro IC50, and its in vivo extent of inhibition in mice was more evident. During this process, enzymatic cleavage of MAHNP-DOX is critical for its activation and cellular uptake. In addition, a synergistic response was observed after the combination of DOX and AHNP.

Excess glutamate release is a pivotal event in the evolution of irreversible ischaemic damage in animal models of ischaemia, and drugs that modulate glutamate action either by inhibiting its release, or blocking post-synaptic receptors, are potent neuroprotective agents. Many clinical trials with EAA modulating drugs have been conducted, none individually demonstrating efficacy.OBJECTIVES: To synthesise all the available data on all different classes of EAA modulators and to evaluate evidence of effects on outcome systematically.SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant trials were identified in the Specialised Register of Controlled Trials (last searched May 2001). In addition, MEDLINE and EMBASE online searches for the terms \"neuroprotection\" (and its variants), \"neuroprotective agent\", for all individual drugs and drug classes included in the review, hand searches of conference proceedings from European, International, American Heart Association and Princeton conferences on Stroke, American Neurological Association and American Academy of Neurology meetings from 1992-2001, and direct contact with individual investigators and pharmaceutical companies.SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials were included if they were randomised, controlled studies giving agents with pharmacological properties that included modification of release of EAAs, or blockade of EAA receptors, in stroke within 24h of onset. Efficacy analysis was restricted to trials with a parallel group design: dose escalation studies were excluded. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed on all data. Outcome had to be reported in terms of death or dependence 1-12 months after the acute event.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were available for 36 of 41 relevant trials identified, involving 11,209 subjects. Data were unavailable for 632 participants (517 in trials fulfilling criteria for efficacy analysis). Seven trials did not report disability data, which were available for 29 trials involving 10,802 subjects. Twenty one of these trials, involving 10,342 subjects, were parallel group studies included in the primary efficacy analysis. Efficacy analysis included data derived from 9 trials not primarily designed to assess efficacy (1022 subjects). The primary (efficacy) end-point was the proportion of patients dead or disabled at final follow-up (defined by Barthel Index<60 at 3 months by preference). Mortality was a secondary end-point. Drugs were considered as individual agents, and also grouped principally into categories of ion channel modulators (glutamate release inhibition) and NMDA antagonists.MAIN RESULTS: There was no significant heterogeneity of outcome amongst individual drugs, or of drug classes either for the primary efficacy analysis (death or dependence) or for mortality at final follow-up. For the primary efficacy analysis, odds of death or dependence were 1.03 [95% confidence interval 0.96-1.12], and for mortality 1.02 [0.92-1.12]. Neither ion channel modulators (death or dependence 1.02 [0.90-1.16]) nor NMDA antagonists (death or dependence 1.05 [0.95-1.16]) differed from the principal analysis including all compounds. Trends for increased mortality with three NMDA antagonists were seen - selfotel (OR 1.19 [0.81-1.74]), aptiganel (OR 1.32 [0.91-1.93]) and gavestinel (OR 1.12 [0.95-1.32]) - but this did not achieve significance for the NMDA antagonists considered as a class (1.09 [0.96-1.23]). Aptiganel was also associated with a trend towards worse functional outcome (OR 1.20 [0.88-1.65]) although this was not the case for either of the other two compounds. No statistically significant detriment of psychotomimetic NMDA antagonists was found, although a trend towards higher mortality in this sub-group was seen (OR 1.25 [0.96-1.64]).REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of significant benefit or harm from drugs modulating excitatory amino acid action.

Reduction of death or dependence by 8% or more has been excluded for gavestinel and lubeluzole, which contribute most of the data for this review. However, mechanistic understanding of neuroprotection is too poor to extrapolate from these two failed development plans to all glutamate modulators. Further clinical trials of neuroprotective agents remain justified, since confidence limits around estimates of effect remain wide for most agents, and cannot reliably exclude benefit. Although numbers of patients are too small to confirm or refute a trend towards increased mortality with some NMDA antagonists, further commercial development of these agents is exceedingly unlikely."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"No improvement in clinical outcome of stroke has been seen with competitive NMDA antagonists (selfotel) and non-competitive NMDA antagonists (dextrorphan, GV150526, aptiganel and eliprodil).","answer_start":418}],"question":"Is Aptiganel effective for treatment of stroke?","id":"5e44c76f48dab47f26000022_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"During cerebral ischaemia, glutamate is released in supraphysiological amounts and is toxic to brain tissue. This excitotoxicity is mediated by several glutamate receptor subtypes, including the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Clinical trials of drugs that block the NMDA receptor in acute ischaemic stroke have been disappointing. No improvement in clinical outcome of stroke has been seen with competitive NMDA antagonists (selfotel) and non-competitive NMDA antagonists (dextrorphan, GV150526, aptiganel and eliprodil). The AMPA receptor differs in important ways from the NMDA receptor. It is the principal mediator of fast excitatory neurotransmission. This ligand-gated cation channel is primarily permeable to sodium rather than calcium. It is found in grey and white matter. It is expressed by oligodendrocytes. This distribution may provide neuroprotection for both grey and white matter. In a variety of animal models, reduction in infarct volume with AMPA blockade has been demonstrated. AMPA antagonists also show benefit in spinal cord ischaemia and trauma. The clinical development of safe and effective AMPA blockers has been hampered by poor water solubility and associated renal toxicity.

Secondary end points included mortality and change in National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale score at 7 days after stroke.RESULTS: The trial was suspended by the sponsor and the independent data and safety monitoring board because of both a lack of efficacy and a potential imbalance in mortality. There was no improvement in outcome for either aptiganel (low-dose or high-dose) group compared with the placebo group at 90 days (median Modified Rankin Scale score for all 3 treatment groups = 3; P =.31). At 7 days, placebo-treated patients exhibited slightly greater neurological improvement on the NIH Stroke Scale than high-dose aptiganel patients (mean improvement for placebo group, -0.8 points vs for high-dose aptiganel, 0.9 points; P =.04). The mortality rate at 120 days in patients treated with high-dose aptiganel was higher than that in patients who received placebo (26.3% vs 19.2%; P =.06).

Two benzothiazolamines, riluzole and lubeluzole, are known blockers of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels. Riluzole is clinically used as a neuroprotectant in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Inhibition of Nav channels by riluzole is voltage-dependent due to preferential binding to inactivated sodium channels. Yet the drug exerts little use-dependent block, probably because it lacks protonable amine. One important property is riluzole ability to inhibit persistent Na+ currents, which likely contributes to its neuroprotective activity.

One important concern is its propensity to prolong the cardiac QT interval, due to hERG K+ channel block.

Mutations of aromatic residues (Y652A and F656A) in the channel inner cavity significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of lubeluzole. Molecular docking simulations performed on the near atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of hERG supported the role of Y652 and F656 as the main contributors to high affinity binding. Group efficiency analysis indicated that both 1,3-benzothiazol-2-amine and 3-aryloxy-2-propanolamine moieties contribute to drug binding with the former giving higher contribution.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the possibility to modulate lubeluzole hERG blockade by introducing suitable substituents onto one or both constituting portions of the parent compound in order to either reduce potency (i. e. torsadogenic potential) or potentiate affinity (useful for class III antiarrhythmic and anticancer agent development).© 2018 The Author(s).

The mechanism by which the BRD4-NUT fusion product blocks NMC cellular differentiation and contributes to oncogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we show that BRD4-NUT and BRD4 colocalize in discrete nuclear foci that are hyperacetylated but transcriptionally inactive. BRD4-NUT recruits histone acetyltransferases to induce histone hyperacetylation in these chromatin foci, which provide docking sites for accumulation of additional BRD4 and associated P-TEFB (positive transcription elongation factor b) complexes in the transcriptionally inactive BRD4-NUT foci. These molecular events lead to repression of a BRD4·P-TEFB downstream target gene c-fos, a component of activator protein 1 (AP-1), that directly regulates epithelial differentiation. Knockdown of BRD4-NUT in NMC cells disperses the transcriptionally inactive chromatin foci and releases the transcriptional activators to stimulate c-fos expression, leading to restoration of cellular differentiation.

Here, we investigated the association between genome-wide occupancy of histone H4 acetylation at lysine 12 (H4K12ac) and BRD4 in the context of estrogen-induced transcription. Similar to BRD4, we observed that H4K12ac occupancy increases near the transcription start sites (TSS) of estrogen-induced genes as well as at distal ERα binding sites in an estrogen-dependent manner. Interestingly, H4K12ac occupancy highly correlates with BRD4 binding and enhancer RNA production on ERα-positive enhancers. Consistent with an importance in estrogen-induced gene transcription, H4K12ac occupancy globally increased in ER-positive cells relative to ER-negative cells and these levels were further increased by estrogen treatment in an ERα-dependent manner.

Diabetes‑induced cardiomyopathy has a complex pathogenesis and histone deacetylase‑mediated epigenetic processes are of prominent importance. The olfactory bromodomain‑containing protein 4 (BRD4) is a protein that recognizes and binds acetylated lysine. It has been reported that the high expression of BRD4 is involved in the process of cardiac hypertrophy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the function of BRD4 in the process of high glucose (HG)‑induced cardiac hypertrophy, and to clarify whether epigenetic regulation involving BRD4 is an important mechanism. It was revealed that BRD4 expression levels were increased in H9C2 cells following 48 h of HG stimulation. This result was also observed in a diabetic rat model. Furthermore, HG stimulation resulted in the upregulation of the myocardial hypertrophy marker, atrial natriuretic peptide, the cytoskeletal protein α‑actin and fibrosis‑associated genes including transforming growth factor‑β, SMAD family member 3, connective tissue growth factor and collagen, type 1, α1. However, administration of the specific BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 (250 nM) for 48 h reversed this phenomenon. Furthermore, protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation was activated by HG stimulation and suppressed by JQ1. In conclusion, BRD4 serves an important role in the pathogenesis of HG‑induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through the AKT pathway."}]},{"title":"yesno","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"An unexpectedly large number of human autosomal genes are subject to monoallelic expression (MAE).

In some observational studies it has been associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke. Both antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulant drugs are used to reduce risk of stroke but whether one treatment strategy is more effective than the other is unknown. We compared their efficacy in the Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study (CADISS), with the additional aim of establishing the true risk of recurrent stroke.METHODS: We did this randomised trial at hospitals with specialised stroke or neurology services (39 in the UK and seven in Australia). We included patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection with onset of symptoms within the past 7 days. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an automated telephone randomisation service to receive antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulant drugs (specific treatment decided by the local clinician) for 3 months. Patients and clinicians were not masked to allocation, but investigators assessing endpoints were. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral stroke or death in the intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered with EUDract (2006-002827-18) and ISRN (CTN44555237).FINDINGS: We enrolled 250 participants (118 carotid, 132 vertebral). Mean time to randomisation was 3·65 days (SD 1·91). The major presenting symptoms were stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n=224) and local symptoms (headache, neck pain, or Horner's syndrome; n=26). 126 participants were assigned to antiplatelet treatment versus 124 to anticoagulant treatment. Overall, four (2%) of 250 patients had stroke recurrence (all ipsilateral). Stroke or death occurred in three (2%) of 126 patients versus one (1%) of 124 (odds ratio [OR] 0·335, 95% CI 0·006-4·233; p=0·63). There were no deaths, but one major bleeding (subarachnoid haemorrhage) in the anticoagulant group. Central review of imaging failed to confirm dissection in 52 patients. Preplanned per-protocol analysis excluding these patients showed stroke or death in three (3%) of 101 patients in the antiplatelet group versus one (1%) of 96 patients in the anticoagulant group (OR 0·346, 95% CI 0·006-4·390; p=0·66).INTERPRETATION: We found no difference in efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs at preventing stroke and death in patients with symptomatic carotid and vertebral artery dissection but stroke was rare in both groups, and much rarer than reported in some observational studies. Diagnosis of dissection was not confirmed after review in many cases, suggesting that radiographic criteria are not always correctly applied in routine clinical practice.FUNDING: Stroke Association.Copyright © 2015 Markus et al.

The primary endpoint was recurrent stroke at 3 months. A systematic review was performed, and results of published studies included in a meta-analysis with the CADISS-NR results.RESULTS: In CADISS-NR, one patient in each group had recurrent ischemic stroke (antiplatelet 1/59 [1.69% ], anticoagulation 1/28 [3.57%]). At the primary endpoint of 3 months, 3 (5.08%) antiplatelet patients had recurrent TIA, compared with none in the anticoagulation group. For meta-analysis, there were data from 40 nonrandomized studies including 1,636 patients. There was no significant difference between the 2 treatments in recurrent stroke risk (antiplatelet 13/499 [2.6%], anticoagulant 20/1,137 [1.8%], odds ratio [OR] 1.49) or risk of death (antiplatelet 5/499 [1.00%], anticoagulant 9/1,137 [0.80%], OR 1.27).CONCLUSION: There is no evidence for superiority of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy in prevention of stoke after carotid and vertebral artery dissection; however, all data are from nonrandomized studies and randomized studies are required.

To probe the dependence of HP1a binding on H3K9me, its dependence on these three HKMTs, and the division of labor between the HKMTs, we have examined correlations between HP1a binding and H3K9me patterns in wild type and null mutants of these HKMTs.

Both proteins bind to the same chromatin regions on polytene chromosomes and act cooperatively to suppress variegation and mediate gene silencing. In addition, Eyg binds to a wingless (wg) enhancer region, recruiting HP1a to assemble a closed, heterochromatin-like conformation that represses transcription of the wg gene. We describe here the evidence that suggests that Eyg, encoded by eyegone (eyg), represses wingless (wg) during eye development by association with HP1a. We show that Eyg forms a protein complex with HP1a and both proteins colocalize on salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Using position effect variegation (PEV) experiments, we demonstrated that eyg has a dose-dependent effect on heterochromatin gene silencing and identified a genetic interaction with HP1a in this process. We further demonstrated that HP1a binds to the same wg enhancer element as Eyg. DNase I sensitivity assays indicated that this enhancer region has a closed heterochromatin-like conformation, which becomes open in eyg mutants. In these mutants, much less HP1a binds to the wg enhancer region, as shown by ChIP experiments. Furthermore, as previously described for Eyg, a reduction in the amount of HP1a in the eye imaginal disc derepresses wg. Together, our results suggest a model in which Eyg specifically binds to the wg enhancer region, recruiting HP1a to that site. The recruitment of HP1a prevents transcription by favoring a closed, heterochromatin-like structure.

We identify here a conserved domain in the large subunit of the CAF-1 complex required for its interaction with HP1a in the Drosophila fruit fly. Functional analysis reveals that this domain is dispensable for viability but participates in two processes involving heterochromatin: position-effect variegation and long range chromosomal interactions during meiotic prophase. Importantly, the identification in the large subunit of CAF-1 of a domain required for its interaction with HP1 allows the separation of its functions in heterochromatin-related processes from its function in the assembly of H3-H4 dimers onto newly synthesized DNA."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"As expected, active gene promoters are mostly not present in LADs, HP1a and Pc domains.

However, in Kc167 cell culture, the only Drosophilla cell type where LADs have previously been mapped, they are neither H3K9me2-enriched nor overlapped with the domains of heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a).RESULTS: Here, using cell type-specific DamID we mapped genome-wide LADs, HP1a and Polycomb (Pc) domains from the central brain, Repo-positive glia, Elav-positive neurons and the fat body of Drosophila third instar larvae. Strikingly, contrary to Kc167 cells of embryonic origin, in neurons and, to a lesser extent, in glia and the fat body, HP1a domains appear to overlap strongly with LADs in both the chromosome arms and pericentromeric regions. Accordingly, centromeres reside closer to the nuclear lamina in neurons than in Kc167 cells. As expected, active gene promoters are mostly not present in LADs, HP1a and Pc domains. These domains are occupied by silent or weakly expressed genes with genes residing in the HP1a-bound LADs expressed at the lowest level.CONCLUSIONS: In various differentiated Drosophila cell types, we discovered the existence of peripheral heterochromatin, similar to that observed in mammals.

Here, we investigate how late-segregating acentric chromosomes that would otherwise form micronuclei instead reintegrate into daughter nuclei by passing through Aurora B kinase-dependent channels in the nuclear envelope of Drosophila melanogaster neuroblasts. We find that localized concentrations of Aurora B preferentially phosphorylate H3(S10) on acentrics and their associated DNA tethers. This phosphorylation event prevents HP1a from associating with heterochromatin and results in localized inhibition of nuclear envelope reassembly on endonuclease- and X-irradiation-induced acentrics, promoting channel formation. Finally, we find that HP1a also specifies initiation sites of nuclear envelope reassembly on undamaged chromatin. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Aurora B-mediated regulation of HP1a-chromatin interaction plays a key role in maintaining genome integrity by locally preventing nuclear envelope assembly and facilitating the incorporation of late-segregating acentrics into daughter nuclei."}]},{"title":"summary","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Technological advances have made it possible to measure spatially resolved gene expression at high throughput.

Moreover, removal of H chain or, separately, L chain (kappa/lambda) locus core sequences by gene targeting has prevented B cell development.

To test whether H chain Abs can be produced in mice, and to investigate how their expression affects B cell development, we introduced a rearranged dromedary gamma2a H chain into the mouse germline. The dromedary transgene was expressed as a naturally occurring Ag-specific disulphide-linked homodimer, which showed that B cell development can be instigated by expression of single H chains without L chains.

Tyrosine kinase (PtkA;TK) activated by autophosphorylation; phosphorylates TP, which subsequently leads to increase in its phosphatase activity. The phosphorylated TP is secreted in phagosome of macrophage. In the present study, we have shown that the phosphorylation at two sites of TP; Y128 and Y129 are critical for TK-mediated phosphatase activity. The disruption of this interaction between TK and TP inhibits activation of later which further leads to the decrease in intracellular survival of mycobacteria. Furthermore, the proof of concept has been established using benzylbenzofurans and benzofuranamides, which inhibit the growth and intracellular survival of mycobacteria, associate with the functional sites of TP and contend with the TK.

Mammalian DGK comprises ten isozymes (α-κ) and regulates a wide variety of physiological and pathological events, such as cancer, type II diabetes, neuronal disorders and immune responses. DG and PA consist of various molecular species that have different acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, and consequently, mammalian cells contain at least 50 structurally distinct DG/PA species. Because DGK is one of the components of phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover, the generally accepted dogma is that all DGK isozymes utilize 18:0/20:4-DG derived from PI turnover. We recently established a specific liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method to analyze which PA species were generated by DGK isozymes in a cell stimulation-dependent manner. Interestingly, we determined that DGKδ, which is closely related to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes, preferentially utilized 14:0/16:0-, 14:0/16:1-, 16:0/16:0-, 16:0/16:1-, 16:0/18:0- and 16:0/18:1-DG species (X:Y = the total number of carbon atoms: the total number of double bonds) supplied from the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C pathway, but not 18:0/20:4-DG, in high glucose-stimulated C2C12 myoblasts. Moreover, DGKα mainly consumed 14:0/16:0-, 16:0/18:1-, 18:0/18:1- and 18:1/18:1-DG species during cell proliferation in AKI melanoma cells. Furthermore, we found that 16:0/16:0-PA was specifically produced by DGKζ in Neuro-2a cells during retinoic acid- and serum starvation-induced neuronal differentiation. These results indicate that DGK isozymes utilize a variety of DG molecular species derived from PI turnover-independent pathways as substrates in different stimuli and cells. DGK isozymes phosphorylate various DG species to generate various PA species. It was revealed that the modes of activation of conventional and novel protein kinase isoforms by DG molecular species varied considerably. However, PA species-selective binding proteins have not been found to date. Therefore, we next attempted to identify PA species-selective binding proteins from the mouse brain and identified α-synuclein, which has causal links to Parkinson's disease. Intriguingly, we determined that among phospholipids, including several PA species (16:0/16:0-PA, 16:0/18:1-PA, 18:1/18:1-PA, 18:0/18:0-PA and 18:0/20:4-PA); 18:1/18:1-PA was the most strongly bound PA to α-synuclein. Moreover, 18:1/18:1-PA strongly enhanced secondary structural changes from the random coil form to the α-helix form and generated a multimeric and proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein protein. In contrast with the dogma described above, our recent studies strongly suggest that PI turnover-derived DG species and also various DG species derived from PI turnover-independent pathways are utilized by DGK isozymes. DG species supplied from distinct pathways may be utilized by DGK isozymes based on different stimuli present in different types of cells, and individual PA molecular species would have specific targets and exert their own physiological functions."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Several studies have revealed that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) can mediate phosphorylation of steroid receptors at multiple sites, including serine 81 of the androgen receptor (AR)","answer_start":0}],"question":"What is the function of a protein kinase?","id":"5e4f2aeb6d0a277941000032_005","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Several studies have revealed that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) can mediate phosphorylation of steroid receptors at multiple sites, including serine 81 of the androgen receptor (AR).

The cytoplasmic fate of ligands internalized within endocytic vesicles or endosomes is variable. For example, maternal immunoglobulins are transported through the cytoplasm of neonatal intestinal epithelial cells and are exocytosed at the basolateral surface. However, other ligands are degraded as a result of their delivery to the lysosomal compartment of cells. Although the translocation of endosomes to the Golgi region in the cell centre seems to be a general phenomenon presumably coupled to ligand degradation by lysosomes and endosomes and lysosomes undergo saltatory movements within the cytoplasm, the spatial control of interaction between the two structures is not understood. To address this problem we have begun to examine the spatial and temporal intracellular distribution of endosomes and lysosomes. Utilizing a new fluorescent microscopic approach, we have now been able simultaneously to visualize endosome and lysosome populations in living cells. Our results suggest that a specific relocation of lysosomes is rapidly induced upon binding of different types of ligands to the cell surface; this migration of lysosomes to the Golgi region of the cell precedes the translocation of endosomes into the same area."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Receptor-mediated endocytosis proceeds by transfer of receptor-ligand complexes from clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface to uncoated endocytic vesicles termed receptosomes (or endosomes).","answer_start":0}],"question":"What cellular process is the protein clathrin involved in?","id":"5e4fd44a6d0a277941000033_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Receptor-mediated endocytosis proceeds by transfer of receptor-ligand complexes from clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface to uncoated endocytic vesicles termed receptosomes (or endosomes).

SATB1 binds to the bases of chromatin loop domains in vivo, recognizing a special DNA context with strong base-unpairing propensity. The majority of thymocytes are eliminated by apoptosis due to selection processes in the thymus. We investigated the fate of SATB1 during thymocyte and T-cell apoptosis. Here we show that SATB1 is specifically cleaved by a caspase 6-like protease at amino acid position 254 to produce a 65-kDa major fragment containing both a base-unpairing region (BUR)-binding domain and a homeodomain. We found that this cleavage separates the DNA-binding domains from amino acids 90 to 204, a region which we show to be a dimerization domain. The resulting SATB1 monomer loses its BUR-binding activity, despite containing both its DNA-binding domains, and rapidly dissociates from chromatin in vivo. We found this dimerization region to have sequence similarity to PDZ domains, which have been previously shown to be involved in signaling by conferring protein-protein interactions. SATB1 cleavage during Jurkat T-cell apoptosis induced by an anti-Fas antibody occurs concomitantly with the high-molecular-weight fragmentation of chromatin of ~50-kb fragments.

We reasoned that since the N-terminal PDZ-like domain (amino acid residues 1-204) lacks DNA binding activity, it would fail to recruit the interacting partners of SATB1 to its genomic binding sites and hence would not repress the SATB1-regulated genes. Indeed, in vivo MAR-linked luciferase reporter assay revealed that overexpression of the PDZ-like domain resulted in de-repression, indicating that the PDZ-like domain exerts a dominant negative effect on genes regulated by SATB1. Next, we developed a stable dominant negative model in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells that conditionally expressed the N-terminal 1-204 region harbouring the PDZ-like domain of SATB1.

This accounted for 4% of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) cases (n = 390) in the cohort. Amino acid substitutions predicted to be pathogenic were assessed by means of analysis of structural protein data. Immunophenotyping, immunoblotting, and ex vivo stimulation of lymphocytes determined the functional effects of these variants. Detailed clinical and pedigree information was collected for genotype-phenotype cosegregation analyses.RESULTS: Both sporadic and familial cases demonstrated evidence of the noninfective complications of CVID, including massive lymphadenopathy (24%), unexplained splenomegaly (48%), and autoimmune disease (48%), features prior studies correlated with worse clinical prognosis. Although partial penetrance of clinical symptoms was noted in certain pedigrees, all carriers have a deficiency in B-lymphocyte differentiation. Detailed assessment of B-lymphocyte numbers, phenotype, and function identifies the presence of an increased CD21low B-cell population.

One of the main causes of diarrhoeal disease is typhoid fever, which is a potentially life-threatening multi-systemic illness. According to the most recent estimates, a total of 26.9 million typhoid fever episodes occurred in 2010. The geographical distribution of the disease differs widely; in developed countries, the incidence rate per 100,000 per year varies from < 0.1 to 0.3, and the disease mainly affects people who travel to endemic areas located in low- and middle-income countries. Low- and middle-income countries are mainly affected owing to the lack of clean water and proper sanitation. In the fight against this plague, prevention is fundamental, and vaccination against typhoid is an effective measure. Vivotif® is an oral live attenuated vaccine which contains a mutated strain of Salmonella (Ty21a) and reproduces the natural infection. The vaccine was first licensed in Europe in 1983 and in the US in 1989, and over the years it has proved efficacious and safe. It is indicated for adults and children from 5 years of age upwards. Specifically, in the most developed countries, vaccination is suggested for highrisk population groups and particularly for international travellers to destinations where the risk of contracting typhoid fever is high. It must also be borne in mind that international travel is increasing. Indeed, international tourist arrivals totalled 1,184 million in 2015 and, on the basis of current trends, international travel is expected to grow by 3-4% in 2017.

These cases of human-to-human transmission involve close contact and have occurred primarily in healthcare settings, and they are suspected to result from repeated zoonotic introductions. In this study, we sequenced whole MERS-CoV genomes directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed MERS cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The exact origin of MERS-CoV remains unknown, but the transmission pattern and evidence from virological studies suggest that dromedary camels are the major reservoir host, from which human infections may sporadically occur through the zoonotic transmission.","answer_start":563}],"question":"What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?","id":"5e2f4a8bfbd6abf43b00002a_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Coronavirus (CoV) infections are commonly associated with respiratory and enteric disease in humans and animals. In 2012, a new human disease called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in the Middle East. MERS was caused by a virus that was originally called human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center/2012 but was later renamed as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV causes high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection, and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals. The exact origin of MERS-CoV remains unknown, but the transmission pattern and evidence from virological studies suggest that dromedary camels are the major reservoir host, from which human infections may sporadically occur through the zoonotic transmission. Human to human transmission also occurs in healthcare facilities and communities. Recent studies on Middle Eastern respiratory continue to highlight the need for further understanding the virus-host interactions that govern disease severity and infection outcome. In this review, we have highlighted the major mechanisms of immune evasion strategies of MERS-CoV. We have demonstrated that M, 4a, 4b proteins and Plppro of MERS-CoV inhibit the type I interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways and therefore facilitate innate immune evasion. In addition, nonstructural protein 4a (NSP4a), NSP4b, and NSP15 inhibit double-stranded RNA sensors. Therefore, the mentioned proteins limit early induction of IFN and cause rapid apoptosis of macrophages. MERS-CoV strongly inhibits the activation of T cells with downregulation of antigen presentation. In addition, uncontrolled secretion of interferon ɣ-induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 can suppress proliferation of human myeloid progenitor cells."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus from camels causing significant mortality and morbidity in humans in the Arabian Peninsula","answer_start":0}],"question":"What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?","id":"5e2f4a8bfbd6abf43b00002a_003","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus from camels causing significant mortality and morbidity in humans in the Arabian Peninsula.

Demographics, clinical features, and anti-epileptic treatment responses were collected and analyzed. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to evaluate three-month outcomes. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine independent prognostic factors.RESULTS: Among 145 consecutive patients with convulsive SE, 48 (33.1%) patents eventually evolved into NCSE. Two patients with cerebral anoxia were exclude. At three-month follow-up, 23 patients (50.0%) had mRS ≥ 3, and 16 (34.8%) died. Thirty-two patients (69.6%) were given continuous intravenous anesthetic drugs (CIVADs). Fourteen patients (30.4%) had CIVAD at the rate >50% proposed maximal dose (PMD). There was a single predictor factor found significant after multivariate logistic regression analysis: the recurrence of EEG seizures within two hours of initiation of CIVAD at a dose of greater than half the proposed maximal dose (OR, 9.63; 95%CI, 1.08-86.18; p = 0.043).

In patients without preexisting epileptic encephalopathy, the following criteria were applied: (1) more than 25 epileptiform discharges (ED) per 10-second epoch, i.e., >2.5/s and (2) patients with EDs ≤ 2.5/s or rhythmic delta/theta activity (RDT) exceeding 0.5/s AND at least one of the additional criteria: (2a) clinical and EEG improvements from antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), (2b) subtle clinical phenomena, or (2c) typical spatiotemporal evolution. In case of fluctuation without evolution or EEG improvement without clinical improvement, \"possible NCSE\" was diagnosed. For identification of RDT, the following criteria were compared: (test condition A) continuous delta-theta activity without further rules, (B) ACNS criterion for rhythmic delta activity (RDA), and (C) ACNS criteria for RDA and fluctuation.RESULTS: False positive rate in controls dropped from 28% (condition A) to 2% (B) (p = 0.00039) and finally to 0% (C) (p = 0.000042). Application of test condition C in the group with NCSE gives one false negative (2%). Various EEG patterns were found in patients with NCSE: (1) 8.2%, (2a) 2%, (2b) 12.2%, and (2c) 32.7%. Possible NCSE was diagnosed based on fluctuations in 57.1% and EEG improvement without clinical improvement in 14.2%.CONCLUSION: The modified SCNC with refined definitions including the ACNS terminology leads to clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction of false positive diagnoses of NCSE and to minimal loss in sensitivity.

Patients in deep coma may exhibit epileptiform EEG patterns, such as generalized periodic spikes, and there is an ongoing debate about the relationship of these patterns and NCSE. The purposes of this review are (i) to discuss the various EEG patterns found in coma, its fluctuations, and transitions and (ii) to propose modified criteria for NCSE in coma. Classical coma patterns such as diffuse polymorphic delta activity, spindle coma, alpha/theta coma, low output voltage, or burst suppression do not reflect NCSE. Any ictal patterns with a typical spatiotemporal evolution or epileptiform discharges faster than 2.5 Hz in a comatose patient reflect nonconvulsive seizures or NCSE and should be treated. Generalized periodic diacharges or lateralized periodic discharges (GPDs/LPDs) with a frequency of less than 2.5 Hz or rhythmic discharges (RDs) faster than 0.5 Hz are the borderland of NCSE in coma. In these cases, at least one of the additional criteria is needed to diagnose NCSE (a) subtle clinical ictal phenomena, (b) typical spatiotemporal evolution, or (c) response to antiepileptic drug treatment. There is currently no consensus about how long these patterns must be present to qualify for NCSE, and the distinction from nonconvulsive seizures in patients with critical illness or in comatose patients seems arbitrary.

To examine molecular mechanism of RHS6 for Th2 cytokine expression, we used DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA, intracellular cytokine staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation.RESULTS: Deletion of RHS6 caused a dramatic resistance to allergic airway inflammation. RHS6 recruited transcription factors GATA3, SATB1, and IRF4, which play important roles in expression of all three Th2 cytokine genes.

We herein show that phosphorylation of Gata3 at Ser308, Thr315 and Ser316 induces dissociation of a histone deacetylase Hdac2 from the Gata3/Chd4 repressive complex in Th2 cells. We also identify Akt1 as a Gata3-phosphorylating kinase, and the activation of Akt1 induces derepression of Tbx21 and Ifng expression in Th2 cells. Moreover, T-bet-dependent IFNγ expression in IFNγ-producing memory Th2 cells appears to be controlled by the phosphorylation status of Gata3 in human and murine systems.

In this review, we present an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction. GATA3 may also directly act on the Ifng gene.

A genome-wide unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation assay coupled with massive parallel sequencing analysis revealed that GATA3 bound to 1279 genes selectively in Th2 cells, and 101 genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells.

The transcription of the 16 GATA3-nonresponding genes was clearly increased by the introduction of an active form of STAT6, STAT6VT.

Cases (n = 98) were patients who tested positive for rotavirus by immunochromatography; those who tested negative (n = 628) comprised the control group. Information on rotavirus immunization history was obtained through linkage with a national immunization registry. Vaccination status was compared between cases and controls, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were obtained from logistic regression models, and vaccine effectiveness calculated as (1 - aOR)*100.RESULTS: Immunization with RotaTeq was less frequent in RVGE cases (73.5%) than in controls (90.1%), p < 0.001; this association persisted after controlling for potential confounders. Effectiveness of the complete vaccine series was estimated at 77% (95% confidence interval (CI): 49-90) in children aged 6-59 months, and 86% (95% CI: 65-94) in children aged 6-23 months; whereas for the incomplete series, the respective estimates were 72% (95% CI: 28-89) and 75% (95% CI: 30-91). Vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 79% (95% CI: 45-92) against G1P[8]-associated RVGE hospitalizations and 69% (95% CI: 11-89) against other genotype-RVGE hospitalizations.CONCLUSIONS: High effectiveness of RotaTeq as the sole rotavirus vaccine in a universal immunization programme was demonstrated in a high-income country. Although partial vaccination conferred protection, completing the vaccine series is warranted to maximize the benefit.Copyright © 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

KMT2C (hereafter referred to as MLL3) frequently incurs point mutations across a range of human tumor types, but precisely how these lesions alter MLL3 function and contribute to oncogenesis is unclear. Here we report a cancer mutational hotspot in MLL3 within the region encoding its plant homeodomain (PHD) repeats and demonstrate that this domain mediates association of MLL3 with the histone H2A deubiquitinase and tumor suppressor BAP1. Cancer-associated mutations in the sequence encoding the MLL3 PHD repeats disrupt the interaction between MLL3 and BAP1 and correlate with poor patient survival. Cancer cells that had PHD-associated MLL3 mutations or lacked BAP1 showed reduced recruitment of MLL3 and the H3K27 demethylase KDM6A (also known as UTX) to gene enhancers. As a result, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in tumor cells harboring BAP1 or MLL3 mutations restored normal gene expression patterns and impaired cell proliferation in vivo. This study provides mechanistic insight into the oncogenic effects of PHD-associated mutations in MLL3 and suggests that restoration of a balanced state of Polycomb-COMPASS activity may have therapeutic efficacy in tumors that bear mutations in the genes encoding these epigenetic factors."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"KMT2C histone methyltransferase","answer_start":1667}],"question":"Which is the catalytic activity of the protein encoded by the gene KMT2C?

These cells, acquired non-invasively, represent a sample of highly relevant tumor tissue that is an alternative to difficult and low-yield tumor biopsies. In recent years, there has been growing interest in genomic profiling of CTCs to enable longitudinal monitoring of the tumor's adaptive response to therapy. However, due to their extreme rarity, genotyping CTCs has proved challenging. Relevant mutations can be masked by leukocyte contamination in isolates. Heterogeneity between subpopulations of tumor cells poses an additional obstacle. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing can overcome these limitations but isolation of single CTCs is prone to cell loss and is prohibitively difficult and time consuming. To address these limitations, we developed a single cell sample preparation and genome sequencing pipeline that combines biophysical enrichment and single cell isolation using laser capture microdissection (LCM). A key component of this process is the encapsulation of enriched CTC sample in a hydrogel matrix, which enhances the efficiency of single-cell isolation by LCM, and is compatible with downstream sequencing. We validated this process by sequencing of single CTCs and cell free DNA (cfDNA) from a single patient with castration resistant prostate cancer. Identical mutations were observed in prostate cancer driver genes (TP53, PTEN, FOXA1) in both single CTCs and cfDNA. However, two independently isolated CTCs also had identical missense mutations in the genes for ATR serine/threonine kinase, KMT2C histone methyltransferase, and FANCC DNA damage repair gene. These mutations may be missed by bulk sequencing libraries, whereas single cell sequencing could potentially enable the characterization of key CTC subpopulations that arise during metastasis."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":" lysine methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C)","answer_start":270}],"question":"Which is the catalytic activity of the protein encoded by the gene KMT2C?

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents a summary of the company's submission (CS), the ERG report and the development of the NICE guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the appraisal committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of T/T based upon the CS. In the CS, pooled evidence of two trials (a phase II trial and RECOURSE) showed that T/T resulted in a significant increase in overall survival [OS; hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78] and progression-free survival (PFS; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.40-0.53). The AC considered the survival benefit of T/T clinically meaningful although relatively small. The ERG highlighted that none of the participants in the phase II trial and approximately half of the RECOURSE participants (394 of 800) were from Europe, which might limit the applicability of the study findings to the NHS. Moreover, the ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns that resulted in 11 adjustments to the company's base-case analysis. The ERG adjustments that had the largest impact were using the RECOURSE trial data only (instead of the pooled evidence), fixing errors and violations and using the utilities from the CORRECT trial (identified in the literature review) only. The ERG preferred to use the RECOURSE trial data only given the suboptimal methodology used by the company to pool the evidence. However, since there were no fundamental arguments to prevent the two trials from being pooled, the ERG also presented its base-case analysis based on the pooled effectiveness estimates. The company base-case resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £44,032 per QALY gained while the ERG base-case resulted in ICERs of £52,695 and £49,392 per QALY gained based on the RECOURSE trial only and pooled evidence, respectively. Since the AC concluded that the most plausible ICER was £49,392 per QALY gained, and that T/T meets end-of-life criteria, T/T was recommended as a cost effective use of NHS resources."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"PURPOSE: Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI; TAS-102, Lonsurf®), a novel form of chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), has shown clinical benefit in the global, phase III RECOURSE trial, regardless of patient age.

DCM is a complex disease and its pathological architecture encounters many genetic determinants interacting with environmental factors. The old perspective that every pathogenic gene mutation would lead to a diseased heart, is now being replaced by the novel observation that the phenotype depends not only on the penetrance-malignancy of the mutated gene-but also on epigenetics, age, toxic factors, pregnancy, and a diversity of acquired diseases. This review discusses how gene mutations will result in mutation-specific molecular alterations in the heart including increased mitochondrial oxidation (sarcomeric gene e.g. TTN), decreased calcium sensitivity (sarcomeric genes), fibrosis (e.g. LMNA and TTN), or inflammation. Therefore, getting a complete picture of the DCM patient will include genomic data, molecular assessment by preference from cardiac samples, stratification according to co-morbidities, and phenotypic description. Those data will help to better guide the heart failure and anti-arrhythmic treatment, predict response to therapy, develop novel siRNA-based gene silencing for malignant gene mutations, or intervene with mutation-specific altered gene pathways in the heart.This article is part of the Mini Review Series from the Varenna 2017 meeting of the Working Group of Myocardial Function of the European Society of Cardiology."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"A major advance in the study of the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DC) has been the identification of a familial trait in a relevant proportion of cases (more than 25%), which indicates that, at least in these cases, a mutated gene is the cause of the disease.","answer_start":0}],"question":"Which is the most mutated gene in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)?","id":"5d374c727bc3fee31f00000d_011","is_impossible":false}],"context":"A major advance in the study of the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DC) has been the identification of a familial trait in a relevant proportion of cases (more than 25%), which indicates that, at least in these cases, a mutated gene is the cause of the disease.

Five different loci that cosegregate with the disease have been mapped so far; the identification of the disease genes is still in progress. The only disease gene known so far is the dystrophin gene, which causes X-linked DC. By analogy with dystrophin, it is believed that other cytoskeletal proteins could be involved in the pathogenesis of DC.

Here we show that cardiac KLF15 is required for the normal cardiac response to fasting. Specifically, we find that cardiac function is impaired upon fasting in systemic and cardiac specific Klf15-null mice. Further, cardiac specific Klf15-null mice display a fasting-dependent accumulation of long chain acylcarnitine species along with a decrease in expression of the carnitine translocase Slc25a20.

In this work, it has been found that CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD+. After treatment of the mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V max was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts, indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix. Prediction on the localization of acetylated residues by bioinformatics correlates well with the experimental data.

Imprinted silencing of Air, Slc22a2 and Slc22a3 is maintained by the replacement promoter and also in the absence of transcriptional overlap with Air. These results exclude a role for the Igf2r promoter and for transcriptional overlap between Igf2r and Air in silencing Air, Slc22a2 and Slc22a3.

By an unbiased mapping of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) in a 192-kb region flanking Igf2r and Air, we identified 21 DHS, of which nine mapped to evolutionarily conserved sequences. Based on the hypothesis that silencing effects of Air would be directed towards cis regulatory elements used to activate genes, DHS are potential key players in the control of imprinted expression. However, in this 192-kb region only the two DHS mapping to the Igf2r and Air promoters show parental specificity. The remaining 19 DHS were present on both parental alleles and, thus, have the potential to activate Igf2r on the maternal allele and Air on the paternal allele. The possibility that the Igf2r and Air promoters share the same cis-acting regulatory elements, albeit on opposite parental chromosomes, was supported by the similar expression profiles of Igf2r and Air in vivo.

One example is genomic imprinting, which is defined as parent-of-origin mono-allelic gene expression. Imprinting is established largely due to epigenetic differences arriving in the zygote from sperm and egg haploid genomes. In the mouse, there are approximately 150 known imprinted genes, many of which occur in imprinted gene clusters that are regulated together. One imprinted cluster includes the maternally expressed Igf2r, Slc22a2, and Slc22a3 genes and the paternally expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Airn. Although it is known that Igf2r and Airn are reciprocally imprinted, the timing of imprinted expression and accompanying epigenetic changes have not been well characterized in vivo.RESULTS: Here we show lineage- and temporal-specific regulation of DNA methylation and histone modifications at the Igf2r/Airn locus correlating with differential establishment of imprinted expression during gastrulation. Our results show that Igf2r is expressed from both alleles in the E6.5 epiblast. After gastrulation commences, the locus becomes imprinted in the embryonic lineage with the lncRNA Airn expressed from the paternal allele and Igf2r restricted to maternal allele expression. We document differentially enriched allele-specific histone modifications in extraembryonic and embryonic tissues. We also document for the first time allele-specific spreading of DNA methylation during gastrulation concurrent with establishment of imprinted expression of Igf2r. Importantly, we show that imprinted expression does not change in the extraembryonic lineage even though maternal DMR2 methylation spreading does occur, suggesting distinct mechanisms at play in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that similar to preimplantation, gastrulation represents a window of dynamic lineage-specific epigenetic regulation in vivo."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Our study thus provides the best candidate factor for establishing paternal silencing of marsupial IGF2R without transcriptional overlap, which is distinct from the Igf2r silencing mechanism of Airn, but which may be analogous to the mode of action for the flanking Slc22a2 and Slc22a3 gene silencing in the mouse placenta.","answer_start":1992}],"question":"How is Slc22a3 imprinted?","id":"5d3802a27bc3fee31f00000e_008","is_impossible":false}],"context":"BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting leads to maternal expression of IGF2R in both mouse and opossum. In mouse, the antisense long noncoding (lnc) RNA Airn, which is paternally expressed from the differentially methylated region (DMR) in the second intron of Igf2r, is required to silence the paternal Igf2r. In opossum, however, intriguingly, the DMR was reported to be in a different downstream intron (intron 11) and there was no antisense lncRNA detected in previous analyses. Therefore, clarifying the imprinting mechanism of marsupial IGF2R is of great relevance for understanding the origin and evolution of genomic imprinting in the IGF2R locus. Thus, the antisense lncRNA associated with the marsupial DMR can be considered as the 'missing link'. In this study, we identified a novel antisense lncRNA, ALID, after detailed analysis of the IGF2R locus in an Australian marsupial, the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, and compared it to that of the grey short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica.RESULTS: Tammar IGF2R showed maternal expression and had a maternally methylated CpG island (CGI) in intron 12 as well as a promoter CGI without differential methylation, but none in the second intron. Re-analysis of the IGF2R of opossum detected the CGI in intron 12, not intron 11, as previously reported, confirming that the DMR in intron 12 is conserved between these marsupials and so is the putative imprinting control region of marsupial IGF2R. ALID is paternally expressed from the middle of the DMR and is approximately 650 bp long with a single exon structure that is extremely short compared to Airn. Hence, the lncRNA transcriptional overlap of the IGF2R promoter, which is essential for the Igf2r silencing in the mouse, is likely absent in tammar. This suggests that fundamental differences in the lncRNA-based silencing mechanisms evolved in eutherian and marsupial IGF2R and may reflect the lack of differential methylation in the promoter CGI of marsupial IGF2R.CONCLUSIONS: Our study thus provides the best candidate factor for establishing paternal silencing of marsupial IGF2R without transcriptional overlap, which is distinct from the Igf2r silencing mechanism of Airn, but which may be analogous to the mode of action for the flanking Slc22a2 and Slc22a3 gene silencing in the mouse placenta."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways.

Nomograms for LR-free rate and RR-free rate at 3- and 5- year were generated as visualizations of Cox proportional hazards regression models, and validated using bootstrap resampling, estimating discrimination and calibration. Results: With a median follow up of 49.50 months, the 3- and 5- year LR-free rate were 95.43% and 94.30% respectively; the 3- and 5- year RR-free rate were 95.94% and 95.41% respectively. The final predictive model for LR included age, the neutrophil/leukocyte ratio (NWR), pathological type, primary gross tumor volume, maxillary sinus invasion, ethmoidal sinus invasion and lacerated foramen invasion; the model for RR involved NWR, plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA copy number, cervical lymph node volume and N category. The models showed fairly good discriminatory ability with concordance indices (c-indices) of 0.76 and 0.74 for predicting LR and RR, respectively, as well as good calibration. The proposed stratification of risk groups based on the nomograms allowed significant distinction between Kaplan-Meier curves for LR and RR.

Angiotensin (Ang) II, the most active metabolite of the renin-angiotensin system, plays an outstanding role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and vascular injury. Activation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has shown to attenuate devastating effects of Ang II in the cardiovascular system by reducing Ang II degradation and increasing Ang-(1-7) generation leading to Mas receptor activation. Recent Advances: Activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis reduces hypertension and improves vascular injury mainly through an increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreased reactive oxygen species production. Recent studies reported that shedding of the enzymatically active ectodomain of ACE2 from the cell surface seems to regulate its activity and serves as an interorgan communicator in cardiovascular disease. In addition, collectrin, an ACE2 homolog with no catalytic activity, regulates blood pressure through an NO-dependent mechanism.CRITICAL ISSUES: Large body of experimental data confirmed sustained beneficial effects of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis activation on hypertension and vascular injury. Experimental studies also suggest that activation of collectrin might be beneficial in hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. Their role in clinical hypertension is unclear as selective and reliable activators of both axes are not yet available.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: This review will highlight the results of recent research progress that illustrate the role of both ACE and collectrin in the modulation of NO and oxidative stress in blood pressure homeostasis and vascular injury, providing evidence for the potential therapeutic application of ACE2 and collectrin in hypertension and vascular disease.

ACE2 enzymatic activity and protein can be detected in biological fluids, including urine, plasma, and conditioned cell culture media. We present a detailed method for measurement of ACE2 activity in biological fluids, using hydrolysis of an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic ACE2 substrate, in the absence or presence of the ACE2 inhibitors MLN-4760 or DX600. Recombinant human or mouse ACE2 is used to generate standard curves for this assay, with ACE2 detection ranging from 1.56 to 50 ng/ml. While MLN-4760 potently inhibits the activity of both human and mouse ACE2, DX600 (linear form) only effectively blocks human ACE2 activity in this assay. In biological samples of human and mouse urine, cell culture medium from mouse proximal tubular cells, and mouse plasma, the mean intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) of the assay range from 1.43 to 4.39 %, and from 7.01 to 13.17 %, respectively. We present data on the time and substrate concentration dependence of the assay, and show that exogenous D -glucose, creatinine, urea, and albumin do not interfere with its performance. In biological fluids, this assay is a simple and reliable method to study the role of ACE2 and its shed fragments in cardiovascular and renal diseases."}]},{"title":"list","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Classical AS is a progressive renal disease presenting with a triad of progressive hematuric nephritis and typical extra-renal complications, such as sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and variable ocular anomalies.

Classical AS is a progressive renal disease presenting with a triad of progressive hematuric nephritis and typical extra-renal complications, such as sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and variable ocular anomalies. The mode of inheritance in AS is X-linked in 85%, autosomal recessive in 15%, and autosomal dominant in rare cases.OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify underlying mutation in multiple individuals from a large consanguineous Saudi family with inherited nephropathy, including our index patient who manifested all the features of classical AS.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were diagnosed by nephrologists and clinical geneticists. All the individuals underwent clinical, audiological and ophthalmological evaluation. Blood samples were collected after written informed consent. DNA extraction, homozygosity mapping and PCR amplification followed standard methodologies.RESULTS: The disease locus was mapped to 2q36.3, where both COL4A3 and COL4A4 reside. Sanger sequencing of COL4A3 and COL4A4 revealed an underlying novel homozygous disease-causing COL4A4 mutation (c.2420delG; p.G807fsX60) in the affected proband. Considerable phenotypic variability segregating with this COL4A4 mutation in our study family is documented. The homozygous mutants were manifesting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in their adolescence, while the heterozygous carrier members were presenting with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity ranging from intermittent hematuria to late onset ESRD. In addition, there is a relatively severe involvement of the ear (SNHL) and eye in the homozygotes than the heterozygotes. Fertility problems were also noted in both of the homozygous females.CONCLUSION: Identification of the causative mutation is an efficient strategy for conclusive molecular diagnosis in the patients and to establish genotype/phenotype correlation. It is important to study and evaluate asymptomatic carriers, to predict prognosis of the disease and to obviate the need for another renal biopsy in at-risk related family members. While an accurate genetic diagnosis of AS provides valuable information for genetic counseling in the extended family members, it can also facilitate future prenatal diagnosis and planning for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To this day, Alport syndrome still inevitably leads to end-stage renal disease and the need for renal replacement therapy, starting in young adulthood. During the past two decades, research into this rare disease has focused on the effects of mutations in collagen type IV and the role of changes in podocytes and the glomerular basement membrane that lead to early kidney fibrosis. Animal models of Alport syndrome also demonstrate the pathogenetic importance of interactions between podocytes and the extracellular matrix. Such models might also help researchers to answer basic questions about podocyte function and the development of fibrosis, and to develop new therapeutic approaches that might be of use in other kidney diseases. In this Review, we discuss the latest basic and clinical research on Alport syndrome, focusing on the roles of podocyte pathology and the extracellular matrix.

This change repositions DSB hotspots and completely restores fertility in male hybrids. Here we show that alteration of one Prdm9 allele impacts the behaviour of DSBs controlled by the other allele at chromosome-wide scales. These effects correlate strongly with the degree to which each PRDM9 variant binds both homologues at the DSB sites it controls. Furthermore, higher genome-wide levels of such 'symmetric' PRDM9 binding associate with increasing fertility measures, and comparisons of individual hotspots suggest binding symmetry plays a downstream role in the recombination process. These findings reveal that subspecies-specific degradation of PRDM9 binding sites by meiotic drive, which steadily increases asymmetric PRDM9 binding, has impacts beyond simply changing hotspot positions, and strongly support a direct involvement in hybrid infertility.

In most mammals, the placement of genetic crossovers is determined by the binding of PRDM9, a highly polymorphic protein with a long zinc finger array, to its cognate binding sites. It is one of over 800 genes encoding proteins with zinc finger domains in the human genome.RESULTS: We report a novel technique, Affinity-seq, that for the first time identifies both the genome-wide binding sites of DNA-binding proteins and quantitates their relative affinities. We have applied this in vitro technique to PRDM9, the zinc-finger protein that activates genetic recombination, obtaining new information on the regulation of hotspots, whose locations and activities determine the recombination landscape. We identified 31,770 binding sites in the mouse genome for the PRDM9(Dom2) variant. Comparing these results with hotspot usage in vivo, we find that less than half of potential PRDM9 binding sites are utilized in vivo. We show that hotspot usage is increased in actively transcribed genes and decreased in genomic regions containing H3K9me2/3 histone marks or bound to the nuclear lamina.CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a major factor determining whether a binding site will become an active hotspot and what its activity will be are constraints imposed by prior chromatin modifications on the ability of PRDM9 to bind to DNA in vivo.

In mammals, the Prdm9 gene, which encodes a meiosis-specific histone H3 methyltransferase, has recently been identified as a determinant of CO hotspots. Here, using transgenic mice, we show that the sole modification of PRDM9 zinc fingers leads to changes in hotspot activity, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) levels, and chromosome-wide distribution of COs. We further demonstrate by an in vitro assay that the PRDM9 variant associated with hotspot activity binds specifically to DNA sequences located at the center of the three hotspots tested. Remarkably, we show that mutations in cis located at hotspot centers and associated with a decrease of hotspot activity affect PRDM9 binding.

The objective of this study was to examine the association between dental x-rays-the most common artificial source of ionizing radiation-and the risk of intracranial meningioma.METHODS: This population-based case-control study included 1433 patients who had intracranial meningioma diagnosed at ages 20 to 79 years and were residents of the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, the San Francisco Bay Area, and 8 counties in Houston, Texas between May 1, 2006 and April 28, 2011 (cases). A control group of 1350 individuals was frequency matched on age, sex, and geography (controls). The main outcome measure for the study was the association between a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma and self-reported bitewing, full-mouth, and panorex dental x-rays.RESULTS: Over a lifetime, cases were more than twice as likely as controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-2.9) to report having ever had a bitewing examination. Regardless of the age at which the films were obtained, individuals who reported receiving bitewing films on a yearly basis or with greater frequency had an elevated risk for ages <10 years (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8), ages 10 to 19 years (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0), ages 20 to 49 years (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.6), and ages ≥40 years (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0). An increased risk of meningioma also was associated with panorex films taken at a young age or on a yearly basis or with greater frequency, and individuals who reported receiving such films at ages <10 years had a 4.9 times increased risk (95% CI, 1.8-13.2) of meningioma.

PRDM9 is required for fertility in mice, but little is known about its localization and developmental dynamics. Application of spermatogenic stage-specific markers demonstrates that PRDM9 accumulates in male germ cell nuclei at pre-leptonema to early leptonema but is no longer detectable in nuclei by late zygonema. By the pachytene stage, PRDM9-dependent histone H3K4 trimethyl marks on hotspots also disappear. PRDM9 localizes to nuclei concurrently with the deposition of meiotic cohesin complexes, but is not required for incorporation of cohesin complex proteins into chromosomal axial elements, or accumulation of normal numbers of RAD51 foci on meiotic chromatin by late zygonema. Germ cells lacking PRDM9 exhibit inefficient homology recognition and synapsis, with aberrant repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks and transcriptional abnormalities characteristic of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin.

Here we report genome-wide analyses of PRDM9-dependent histone modifications using two inbred mouse strains differing only in their PRDM9 zinc finger domain.

We also show that DSBs are centered over the PRDM9 binding motif within the nucleosome-depleted region.

PRDM9 binds to DNA at hotspots through its zinc finger domain and activates recombination by trimethylating histone H3K4 on adjacent nucleosomes through its PR/SET domain. Recently, the isolated PR/SET domain of PRDM9 was shown capable of also trimethylating H3K36 in vitro, raising the question of whether this reaction occurs in vivo during meiosis, and if so, what its function might be. Here, we show that full-length PRDM9 does trimethylate H3K36 in vivo in mouse spermatocytes. Levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are highly correlated at hotspots, but mutually exclusive elsewhere. In vitro, we find that although PRDM9 trimethylates H3K36 much more slowly than it does H3K4, PRDM9 is capable of placing both marks on the same histone molecules. In accord with these results, we also show that PRDM9 can trimethylate both K4 and K36 on the same nucleosomes in vivo, but the ratio of K4me3/K36me3 is much higher for the pair of nucleosomes adjacent to the PRDM9 binding site compared to the next pair further away. Importantly, H3K4me3/H3K36me3-double-positive nucleosomes occur only in regions of recombination: hotspots and the pseudoautosomal (PAR) region of the sex chromosomes.

PRDM9 binds to DNA at hotspots through its zinc finger domain and activates recombination by trimethylating histone H3K4 on adjacent nucleosomes through its PR/SET domain. Recently, the isolated PR/SET domain of PRDM9 was shown capable of also trimethylating H3K36 in vitro, raising the question of whether this reaction occurs in vivo during meiosis, and if so, what its function might be. Here, we show that full-length PRDM9 does trimethylate H3K36 in vivo in mouse spermatocytes. Levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are highly correlated at hotspots, but mutually exclusive elsewhere. In vitro, we find that although PRDM9 trimethylates H3K36 much more slowly than it does H3K4, PRDM9 is capable of placing both marks on the same histone molecules. In accord with these results, we also show that PRDM9 can trimethylate both K4 and K36 on the same nucleosomes in vivo, but the ratio of K4me3/K36me3 is much higher for the pair of nucleosomes adjacent to the PRDM9 binding site compared to the next pair further away. Importantly, H3K4me3/H3K36me3-double-positive nucleosomes occur only in regions of recombination: hotspots and the pseudoautosomal (PAR) region of the sex chromosomes. These double-positive nucleosomes are dramatically reduced when PRDM9 is absent, showing that this signature is PRDM9-dependent at hotspots; the residual double-positive nucleosomes most likely come from the PRDM9-independent PAR.

Using a microarray, we identified decreased expression of mixed lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3), a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) lysine methyl transferase at 1 and 3 days of post-common bile duct ligation (CBDL) in mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) analysis revealed that H3K4me3 of transporter promoters by MLL3 as part of activating signal cointegrator-2 -containing complex (ASCOM) is essential for activation of bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2), and sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) genes by FXR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Knockdown of nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCOA6) or MLL3/MLL4 mRNAs by small interfering RNA treatment led to a decrease in BSEP and NTCP mRNA levels in hepatoma cells. Human BSEP promoter transactivation by FXR/RXR was enhanced in a dose-dependent fashion by NCOA6 cDNA coexpression and decreased by AdsiNCOA6 infection in HepG2 cells. GST-pull down assays showed that domain 3 and 5 of NCOA6 (LXXLL motifs) interacted with FXR and that the interaction with domain 5 was enhanced by chenodeoxycholic acid. In vivo ChIP assays in HepG2 cells revealed ligand-dependent recruitment of ASCOM complex to FXR element in BSEP and GR element in NTCP promoters, respectively. ChIP analysis demonstrated significantly diminished recruitment of ASCOM complex components and H3K4me3 to Bsep and Mrp2 promoter FXR elements in mouse livers after CBDL.

Direct sequencing of MNX1 and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were performed. We also analyzed clinical phenotypes and evaluated genotype-phenotype correlations.RESULTS: We identified six novel variants amongst a total of six null variants, one missense variant, and one large deletion. The null variants included four frameshift variants (p.Gly98Alafs* 124, p.Gly145Alafs*77, p.Gly151Leufs*67, and p.Ala216Profs*5) and two nonsense variants (p.Tyr186* and p.Gln212*).

The diagnosis is usually made during childhood and rarely in adulthood. In this context, imaging, and especially MRI plays a major role in the diagnosis of this syndrome. Surgical management is provided by pediatric surgeons or neurosurgeons.FAMILIAL CASE REPORT: Here, we present a family case report with CS requiring different neurosurgical management. The son, a 3-year-old boy, developed a tethered spinal cord syndrome associated to a lipoma of the filum terminale, a sacro-coccygeal teratoma and an anal adhesion. A combined surgical approach permitted a good evolution on the urinary and digestive functions despite a persistent fecal incontinence. The 2-year-old daughter presented with a cyst of the thyreoglossal tract infected and fistulized to the skin. She was also followed for a very small lipoma of the filum terminale that required a neurosurgical approach. The father, 44-year-old, manifested functional digestive and urinary disorders caused by a giant anterior sacral meningocele. The ligation of the neck of the cyst and aspiration of the liquid inside in full through a posterior partial approach permit a complete collapse of the cyst with an instantly satisfactory clinical outcome.CONCLUSION: In these cases, cooperation between pediatric surgeons and neurosurgeons was crucial. The follow-up of these patients should be done in a spina bifida clinic.

Although GRHL2 recently has attracted considerable interest in that it could be identified as a novel suppressor of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, evidence is emerging that GRHL2 also exhibits tumour-promoting activities. Aim of the present study therefore was to help defining the relevance of GRHL2 for human cancers by performing a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of GRHL2 expression in normal (n = 608) and (n = 3,143) tumour tissues using tissue microarrays. Consistent with its accepted role in epithelial morphogenesis, GRHL2 expression preferentially but not exclusively was observed in epithelial cells. Regenerative and proliferating epithelial cells with stem cell features showed a strong GRHL2 expression. Highly complex GRHL2 expression patterns indicative of both reduced and elevated GRHL2 expression in tumours, possibly reflecting potential tumour-suppressing as well as oncogenic functions of GRHL2 in distinct human tumours, were observed. A dysregulation of GRHL2 expression for the first time was found in tumours of non-epithelial origin (e.g., astrocytomas, melanomas). We also report GRHL2 copy number gains which, however, did not necessarily translate into increased GRHL2 expression levels in cancer cells. Results obtained by meta-analysis of gene expression microarray data in conjunction with functional assays demonstrating a direct regulation of HER3 expression further point to a potential therapeutic relevance of GRHL2 in ovarian cancer.

Because restoration of MeCP2 expression in a mouse model reverses neurologic deficits in adult animals, reactivation of the wild-type copy of MeCP2 on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) presents a therapeutic opportunity in RS. To identify genes involved in MeCP2 silencing, we screened a library of 60,000 shRNAs using a cell line with a MeCP2 reporter on the Xi and found 30 genes clustered in seven functional groups. More than half encoded proteins with known enzymatic activity, and six were members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/TGF-β pathway. shRNAs directed against each of these six genes down-regulated X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a key player in X-chromosome inactivation that encodes an RNA that coats the silent X chromosome, and modulation of regulators of this pathway both in cell culture and in mice demonstrated robust regulation of XIST. Moreover, we show that Rnf12, an X-encoded ubiquitin ligase important for initiation of X-chromosome inactivation and XIST transcription in ES cells, also plays a role in maintenance of the inactive state through regulation of BMP/TGF-β signaling.

Here, we describe a key role for a constitutive BDNF feed forward signaling pathway in regulating synaptic response, general growth and differentiation of glutamatergic neurons. Chronic block of TrkB receptors mimics the MeCP2 deficiency in wildtype glutamatergic neurons, while re-expression of BDNF quantitatively rescues MeCP2 deficiency. We show that BDNF acts cell autonomous and autocrine, as wildtype neurons are not capable of rescuing growth deficits in neighboring MeCP2 deficient neurons in vitro and in vivo.

In the present study, we reported that DMP1-PG was expressed in brain astrocytes and enriched in BBB units. The only glycosylation site of DMP1 is serine89 (S89) in the N-terminal domain of the protein in mouse. Mutant mice with DMP1 point mutations changing S89 to glycine (S89G), which completely eradicated glycosylation of the protein, demonstrated severe BBB disruption. Another breed of DMP1 mutant mice, which lacked the C-terminal domain of DMP1, manifested normal BBB function. The polarity of S89G-DMP1 astrocytes was disrupted and cell-cell adhesion was loosened. Through a battery of analyses, we found that DMP1 glycosylation was critically required for astrocyte maturation both in vitro and in vivo. S89G-DMP1 mutant astrocytes failed to express aquaporin 4 and had reduced laminin and ZO1 expression, which resulted in disruption of BBB. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type DMP1-PG in mouse brain driven by the nestin promoter elevated laminin and ZO1 expression beyond wild type levels and could effectively resisted intravenous mannitol-induced BBB reversible opening.

Although the transposition is facilitated by proteins encoded within the gag-pol region which is common to all autonomous elements, some LTR retrotransposons were found to potentially carry an additional protein coding capacity represented by extra open reading frames located upstream or downstream of gag-pol. In this study, we performed a comprehensive in silico survey and comparative analysis of these extra open reading frames (ORFs) in the group of Ty3/gypsy LTR retrotransposons as the first step towards our understanding of their origin and function. We found that extra ORFs occur in all three major lineages of plant Ty3/gypsy elements, being the most frequent in the Tat lineage where most (77 %) of identified elements contained extra ORFs. This lineage was also characterized by the highest diversity of extra ORF arrangement (position and orientation) within the elements. On the other hand, all of these ORFs could be classified into only two broad groups based on their mutual similarities or the presence of short conserved motifs in their inferred protein sequences. In the Athila lineage, the extra ORFs were confined to the element 3' regions but they displayed much higher sequence diversity compared to those found in Tat. In the lineage of Chromoviruses the extra ORFs were relatively rare, occurring only in 5' regions of a group of elements present in a single plant family (Poaceae). In all three lineages, most extra ORFs lacked sequence similarities to characterized gene sequences or functional protein domains, except for two Athila-like elements with similarities to LOGL4 gene and part of the Chromoviruses extra ORFs that displayed partial similarity to histone H3 gene. Thus, in these cases the extra ORFs most likely originated by transduction or recombination of cellular gene sequences.

Several prosthesis and techniques to reduce re-herniation have been proposed including implantation of an annular closure device (ACD) - Barricaid™ and an annular tissue repair system (AR) - Anulex-Xclose™. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assist surgeons determine a potential approach to reduce incidences of recurrent lumbar disc herniation and assess the current devices regarding their outcomes and complications.METHODS: Four electronic full-text databases were systematically searched through September 2017.

Techniques to reduce these consequences may improve outcomes.METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients undergoing lumbar discectomy for single-level herniated disk at 2 institutions were followed prospectively with clinical and radiographic evaluations at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (control cohort). A second consecutive cohort of 30 patients undergoing 31 lumbar discectomies with implantation of an annular closure device was followed similarly. Incidence of recurrent disk herniation, disk height loss, the leg and back pain visual analog scale (VAS), and the Oswestry Disability Index were assessed at each follow-up.RESULTS: Cohorts were well matched at baseline. By 2 years of follow-up, symptomatic recurrent same-level disk herniation occurred in 3 (6.5%) patients in the control cohort versus 0 (0%) patients in the annular repair cohort (P=0.27). A trend of greater preservation of disk height was observed in the annular repair versus the control cohort 3 months (7.9 vs. 7.27 mm, P=0.08), 6 months (7.81 vs. 7.18 mm, P=0.09), and 12 months (7.63 vs. 6.9 mm, P=0.06) postoperatively. The annular closure cohort reported less leg pain (VAS-LP: 5 vs. 16, P<0.01), back pain (VAS-BP: 13 vs. 22, P<0.05), and disability (Oswestry Disability Index: 16 vs. 22, P<0.05) 1 year postoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of a novel annular repair device was associated with greater maintenance of disk height and improved 1-year leg pain, back pain, and low-back disability. Recurrent disk herniation did not occur in any patient after annular repair. Closure of annular defect after lumbar discectomy may help preserve the physiological disk function and prevent long-term disk height loss and associated back and leg pain."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"his study investigated whether implantation with the Barricaid annular closure device (ACD) during discectomy reduced the rate of facet degeneration","answer_start":381}],"question":"What is the purpose of the Barricaid annular closure device?","id":"5e3aab25b5b409ea5300001a_007","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Lumbar discectomy is an effective treatment for lumbar disc herniation (LDH).

We assessed the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a candidate tuberculosis vaccine, modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A), in adults infected with HIV-1.METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of MVA85A in adults infected with HIV-1, at two clinical sites, in Cape Town, South Africa and Dakar, Senegal. Eligible participants were aged 18-50 years, had no evidence of active tuberculosis, and had baseline CD4 counts greater than 350 cells per μL if they had never received antiretroviral therapy or greater than 300 cells per μL (and with undetectable viral load before randomisation) if they were receiving antiretroviral therapy; participants with latent tuberculosis infection were eligible if they had completed at least 5 months of isoniazid preventive therapy, unless they had completed treatment for tuberculosis disease within 3 years before randomisation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four by randomly generated sequence to receive two intradermal injections of either MVA85A or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by antiretroviral therapy status and study site. Participants, nurses, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to group allocation. The second (booster) injection of MVA85A or placebo was given 6-12 months after the first vaccination. The primary study outcome was safety in all vaccinated participants (the safety analysis population). Safety was assessed throughout the trial as defined in the protocol. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease, assessed in the per-protocol population. Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset of participants at day 7 and day 28 after the first and second vaccination, and M tuberculosis infection and disease were assessed at the end of the study. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01151189.FINDINGS: Between Aug 4, 2011, and April 24, 2013, 650 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned; 649 were included in the safety analysis (324 in the MVA85A group and 325 in the placebo group) and 645 in the per-protocol analysis (320 and 325). 513 (71%) participants had CD4 counts greater than 300 cells per μL and were receiving antiretroviral therapy; 136 (21%) had CD4 counts above 350 cells per μL and had never received antiretroviral therapy. 277 (43%) had received isoniazid prophylaxis before enrolment. Solicited adverse events were more frequent in participants who received MVA85A (288 [89%]) than in those given placebo (235 [72%]). 34 serious adverse events were reported, 17 (5%) in each group. MVA85A induced a significant increase in antigen 85A-specific T-cell response, which peaked 7 days after both vaccinations and was primarily monofunctional. The number of participants with negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube findings at baseline who converted to positive by the end of the study was 38 (20%) of 186 in the MVA85A group and 40 (23%) of 173 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 11·7% (95% CI -41·3 to 44·9). In the per-protocol population, six (2%) cases of tuberculosis disease occurred in the MVA85A group and nine (3%) occurred in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 32·8% (95% CI -111·5 to 80·3).INTERPRETATION: MVA85A was well tolerated and immunogenic in adults infected with HIV-1. However, we detected no efficacy against M tuberculosis infection or disease, although the study was underpowered to detect an effect against disease. Potential reasons for the absence of detectable efficacy in this trial include insufficient induction of a vaccine-induced immune response or the wrong type of vaccine-induced immune response, or both.FUNDING: European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (IP.2007.32080.002), Aeras, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, and Oxford-Emergent Tuberculosis Consortium.Copyright © 2015 Ndiaye et al.

However, as surveillance becomes more integrated into patient care, the benefits and risks must be further evaluated. We briefly describe our institutional experience with surveillance screening in LFS and describe two patients in depth where surveillance imaging brought to light false positives that led to increased utilization of resources and concern for new malignancy. Though the benefits of surveillance are clear, it is important to understand the potential for false positives involved with instituting this practice. Continued research of this topic is thus warranted, perhaps with larger prospective studies, to better capture the survival benefits of patients undergoing surveillance screening and more comprehensively understand the incidence of false positives."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a multiorgan cancer predisposition caused by germline TP53 mutations, confers significant cancer risks for young people (15-39 years).

Yet evidence of how individuals experience this condition and the psychosocial implications are lacking. Therefore, this systematic review assessed the psychosocial implications of living with, or at risk of, an autosomal dominant condition as a young person, to draw evidence that may be analogous for young people with LFS.METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for studies published in peer-reviewed journals using Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase databases. Findings were synthesized and are reported thematically.RESULTS: We screened 352 articles and identified 39 studies, representing the perspectives of 765 young people. Most studies addressed hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (n = 22) and used qualitative methodologies (n = 35). Only one LFS study was identified, highlighting the distinct lack of psychosocial research describing experiences of young people with LFS. Translatable evidence showed that familial factors strongly influenced young people's experiences of genetic testing and their mutation status. Major adverse reactions to genetic test results were rare, although young people with a gene mutation experienced various psychosocial concerns at key developmental milestones, including family planning, developing romantic relationships, and making risk management decisions.CONCLUSION: Young people undergoing genetic testing for inherited disease require individualized support and recognition of previous lived experiences. We recommend that longitudinal care be made available to young people with inherited disease as they reach developmental milestones that intersect with risk management, risk perception, and family formation."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the p53 gene.","answer_start":0}],"question":"Is Li–Fraumeni syndrome a rare, autosomal recessive, hereditary disorder that predisposes carriers to cancer development?","id":"5e639a8b1af46fc130000011_003","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the p53 gene.

To unravel BRAFi resistance mechanisms we have performed gene expression and mass spectrometry based proteome profiling of the sensitive parental A375 BRAF V600E-mutated human melanoma cell line and of daughter cell lines with induced BRAFi resistance. Increased expression of two novel resistance candidates, aminopeptidase-N (CD13/ANPEP) and ETS transcription factor FLI1 was observed in the BRAFi-resistant daughter cell lines. In addition, increased levels of the previously reported resistance mediators, receptor tyrosine kinase ephrine receptor A2 (EPHA2) and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET were also identified. The expression of these proteins was assessed in matched tumor samples from melanoma patients obtained before BRAFi and after disease progression. MET was overexpressed in all progression samples while the expression of the other candidates varied between the individual patients. Targeting CD13/ANPEP by a blocking antibody induced apoptosis in both parental A375- and BRAFi-resistant daughter cells as well as in melanoma cells with intrinsic BRAFi resistance and led to dephosphorylation of EPHA2 on S897, previously demonstrated to cause inhibition of the migratory capacity. AKT and RSK, both reported to induce EPHA2 S897 phosphorylation, were also dephosphorylated after inhibition of CD13/ANPEP. FLI1 silencing also caused decreases in EPHA2 S897 phosphorylation and in total MET protein expression. In addition, silencing of FLI1 sensitized the resistant cells to BRAFi. Furthermore, we show that BRAFi in combination with the multi kinase inhibitor dasatinib can abrogate BRAFi resistance and decrease both EPHA2 S897 phosphorylation and total FLI1 protein expression.

After cast removal, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of either bimagrumab 30 mg/kg (n = 15) or placebo (n = 9) and were followed for 12 weeks. Changes in thigh muscle volume (TMV) and inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) of the thigh, maximum voluntary knee extension strength, and safety were assessed throughout the 12 week study.RESULTS: Casting resulted in an average TMV loss of -4.8% and comparable increases in IMAT and SCAT volumes. Bimagrumab 30 mg/kg i.v. resulted in a rapid increase in TMV at 2 weeks following cast removal and a +5.1% increase above pre-cast levels at 12 weeks. In comparison, TMV returned to pre-cast level at 12 weeks (-0.1%) in the placebo group. The increased adiposity of the casted leg was sustained in the placebo group and decreased substantially in the bimagrumab group at Week 12 (IMAT: -6.6%, SCAT: -3.5%). Knee extension strength decreased by ~25% in the casted leg for all subjects and returned to pre-cast levels within 6 weeks after cast removal in both treatment arms. Bimagrumab was well tolerated with no serious or severe adverse events reported during the study.CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of bimagrumab 30 mg/kg i.v. safely accelerated the recovery of TMV and reversal of accumulated IMAT following 2 weeks in a joint-immobilizing cast.© 2017 Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research.

We identified miR-16 to bind the COX-2 3'-UTR and inhibit COX-2 expression by promoting rapid mRNA decay. In colorectal cancer cells and tumors, miR-16 levels were decreased approximately twofold and miR-16 expression in cancer cells attenuated COX-2 expression and PG synthesis.

Under conditions of HuR overexpression, miR-16 was unable to promote rapid mRNA decay through the COX-2 ARE. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation of HuR showed direct association with miR-16 that was reversed when cytoplasmic trafficking of HuR was inhibited. Furthermore, this interaction between HuR and miR-16 promoted the downregulation of miR-16. These new results identify miR-16 as a central posttranscriptional regulator of COX-2 and show the ability of elevated levels of HuR to antagonize miR-16 function.

One mechanism of action is thought to be though the ability of biologics to induce homing and migration of endogenous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to a target tissue. However, the ability of biologics to stimulate chemotaxis (directed migration of cells) and chemokinesis (increase rate of cell migration) of MSCs is unknown.HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to directly compare the ability of biologics including platelet rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to induce MSC migration. The hypothesis was that leukocyte-low platelet rich plasma (Llo PRP) would induce migration to a greater extent than leukocyte-high platelet rich plasma (Lhi PRP) or BMC.METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated from 8 horses. Migration of MSCs toward a biologic (BMC, Llo PRP, and Lhi PRP) or the positive control platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) was continuously traced and measured for 24hrs using time-lapse microscopy and a microfluidics device. Cell migration, chemotaxis and chemokinesis were determined by measurements of displacement, number of cells migrated, and cell flux.RESULTS: All biologics resulted in a significantly greater percentage of MSCs migrated compared to the positive control (PDGF). MSCs migrated further toward BMC compared to Llo PRP. Cell migration, measured as cell flux, was greater toward BMC and Lhi PRP than Llo PRP.CONCLUSION: The biologics BMC and Lhi PRP elicit greater chemotaxis and chemokinesis of MSCs than Llo PRP. However, all biologics recruited the same number of MSCs suggesting that differences in other regenerative effects, such as growth factor concentration, between biologics should be strongly considered when choosing a biologic for treatment of musculoskeletal injuries.

Planned dose escalation was 80, 160, 240, 320, 400, and 480 mg. For pharmacokinetic analysis, timed blood samples were collected on day 1 and day 28. Next-generation sequencing was performed on circulating tumor DNA and genomic DNA from tumor samples. Results Thirty-eight patients were enrolled. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 diarrhea, which occurred in two patients administered 480 mg of pyrotinib; thus, the maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg. Common pyrotinib-related adverse events included diarrhea (44.7% [17 of 38]), nausea (13.2% [five of 38]), oral ulceration (13.2% [five of 38]), asthenia (10.5% [four of 38]), and leukopenia (10.5% [four of 38]). The only grade 3 adverse event was diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that pyrotinib exposure was dose dependent. The overall response rate was 50.0% (18 of 36), and the clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease ≥ 24 weeks) was 61.1% (22 of 36).

For this purpose, a robust analytical method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) was established to characterize the metabolites of pyrotinib in human plasma, feces, and urine, and identify the primary enzymes responsible for its metabolism. As a result, a total of 24 metabolites were identified, including 16 phase I metabolites resulting from dealkylation, oxidation, dehydrogenation, and carbonylation, and 8 phase II metabolites originating from cysteine and N-acetylcysteine conjugation. Pyrotinib was absorbed into blood by 1h, reached its peak level at 4h, and afterwards underwent slow elimination. The principal metabolites detected in humans (M1, M2, and M5) were products resulting from O-depicoline and pyrrolidine lactam formation, whose structures have been confirmed by the synthetic references. In addition, fecal clearance was the major route of excretion for pyrotinib. Further phenotyping experiment proved that CYP3A4 was the most active enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of pyrotinib, implying the vital necessity of the assessment of the potential CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interactions in humans.

Recent studies in experimental systems indicated that the SYT protein may function as a transcriptional activator whereas the SSX proteins may act as transcriptional repressors. In the present work we created a series of deletion mutants and found that SYT and SSX depend on N-terminal and highly conserved C-terminal domains for nuclear localization, respectively. Our results also show that the SYT-SSX proteins colocalize with SSX2, a feature that depends on the presence of the C-terminal SSX sequences in the chimeric proteins. Absence of these sequences led to an altered subcellular localization, coinciding with that of SYT. Besides, we found that endogenously expressed SSX proteins colocalize with polycomb-group proteins and condensed chromosomes during mitosis, features that are also conferred by the C-terminus of SSX.

Arterial hypertension is accompanied by an increased oxidative stress status in the heart characterized by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and nucleic acid oxidation increase. The higher oxidative stress also modifies adhesion molecules expression. In the heart VCAM-1, which was higher than ICAM-1 and PECAM-1, was increased in SHR.

Here we report the expression and the epigenetic regulation of GRP151 in the spinal cord after spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and the contribution of GPR151 to neuropathic pain in male mice. SNL dramatically increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. GPR151 mutation or spinal inhibition by shRNA alleviated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia. Interestingly, the CpG island in the GPR151 gene promoter region was demethylated, the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) was decreased, and the binding of DNMT3b with GPR151 promoter was reduced after SNL. Overexpression of DNMT3b in the spinal cord decreased GPR151 expression and attenuated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), a transcriptional factor of the KLF family, was upregulated in spinal neurons, and the binding affinity of KLF5 with GPR151 promoter was increased after SNL.

In the nervous system of vertebrates, its expression is enriched in specific diencephalic structures, where the highest levels are observed in the habenular area. The habenula has been implicated in a range of different functions including behavioral flexibility, decision making, inhibitory control, and pain processing, which makes it a promising target for treating psychiatric and neurological disease. This study aimed to further characterize neurons expressing the Gpr151 gene, by tracing the afferent connectivity of this diencephalic cell population. Using pseudotyped rabies virus in a transgenic Gpr151-Cre mouse line, monosynaptic afferents of habenular and thalamic Gpr151-expressing neuronal populations could be visualized. The habenular and thalamic Gpr151 systems displayed both shared and distinct connectivity patterns. The habenular neurons primarily received input from basal forebrain structures, the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, the lateral preoptic area, the entopeduncular nucleus, and the lateral hypothalamic area. The Gpr151-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus was primarily contacted by medial hypothalamic areas as well as the zona incerta and projected to specific forebrain areas such as the prelimbic cortex and the accumbens nucleus. Gpr151 mRNA was also detected at low levels in the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus which received input from areas associated with visual processing, including the superior colliculus, zona incerta, and the visual and retrosplenial cortices.

Permanent MCAO results in a modest neutrophil infiltration at 24 h after ischaemia, predominantly around arterial vessels at the margins of infarction, whereas MCAO with subsequent reperfusion is associated with substantial infiltration by neutrophils throughout the entire infarct. Several studies show that C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, is associated with stroke outcomes and future vascular events. Several drugs, especially hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), have been demonstrated to reduce hsCRP levels independently of their effects on plasma cholesterol. Various cytokines were shown to be expressed in the injured brain. Recent investigations demonstrated that mRNAs of above cytokines were induced in the ischemic rat brain. TNF-alpha is a pleiotropic cytokine that mediates key roles in many physiological and pathological cellular processes including acute and chronic inflammation, programmed cell death or apoptosis, anti-tumor responses, and infection. Pharmaceutical industry to search a small molecule TNF inhibitor have taken multiple strategies. Significant protection after in vivo oral use of SB-239063 from brain injury and neurological deficits was observed in one study. In the same study significant protection from brain injury and neurological deficits was also demonstrated due to i.v post-stroke treatment with the same compound. Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion process consists of several steps, beginning with rolling of the leukocyte on the endothelial surface until it has slowed down to such a degree that it sticks to the endothelium. Treatment with a murine anti-ICAM-1 antibody (enlimomab) has been investigated in patients with acute ischemic stroke in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial (EAST). Unfortunately, the case fatality rate in this trial was significantly higher in the enlimomab patient group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, experimental data have shown that focal cerebral ischemia induces a time-dependent activation of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Dissipation of ATP by CD39 reduced P2X7 receptor stimulation and thereby suppressed baseline leukocyte alphaMbeta2-integrin expression. As alphaMbeta2-integrin blockade reversed the postischemic, inflammatory phenotype of Cd39-/- mice, these data suggest that phosphohydrolytic activity on the leukocyte surface suppresses cell-cell interactions that would otherwise promote thrombosis or inflammation."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The two clinical trials of therapy aimed at limiting the inflammatory response in acute stroke that have been carried out to date, however, have not shown a benefit to such therapy.

We did a bedside-to-bench study in standardized rat stroke models to explore mechanisms for these untoward results.METHODS: After focal brain ischemia in Wistar rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we administered murine anti-rat ICAM-1 antibody (1A29), subclass-matched murine immunoglobulin (IgG1), or vehicle intravenously. To examine whether rat anti-mouse antibodies were generated against the mouse protein and whether these were deleterious, we sensitized Wistar rats with 1A29 or vehicle 7 days before surgery. Infarct volume, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, neutrophil CD11b expression, and microvascular E-selectin, P-selectin, and ICAM-1 expression were examined 48 hours after surgery. Complement activation was serially assessed for 2 hours after a single injection of either 1A29 or vehicle.RESULTS: 1A29 treatment did not significantly reduce infarct size in either strain. 1A29 sensitization augmented infarct size and generated rat anti-mouse antibodies. Although 1A29 inhibited neutrophil trafficking shown by reduction in brain myeloperoxidase activity, circulating neutrophils were activated and displayed CD11b upregulation. Complement was activated in 1A29-sensitized Wistar rats and 1A29-treated SHR. E-selectin (SHR), endothelial P-selectin (Wistar and SHR), and ICAM-1 (SHR) were upregulated in animals treated with 1A29.CONCLUSIONS: Administration to rats of a murine antibody preparation against ICAM-1, 1A29, elicits the production of host antibodies against the protein, activation of circulating neutrophils, complement activation, and sustained microvascular activation.

There are four mammalian syndecans, SDC-1 thorough 4, which play a critical role in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis through independent and growth factor mediated signaling. An altered expression of SDCs is often observed in autoimmune disorders, cancer, HIV infection, and many other pathological conditions. SDCs modulate disease progression by interacting with a diverse array of ligands, receptors, and other proteins, including extracellular matrix, glycoproteins, integrins, morphogens, and various growth factors and chemokines, along with their receptors and kinases. Specifically, SDCs present on cell surface can bind directly to chemokines to enhance their binding to receptors, downstream signaling, and migration. Alternatively, SDCs can be cleaved and shed to mediate negative regulation of chemokine and growth factor signaling pathways and ligand sequestration. Importantly, SDC shedding may be a biomarker of inflammation, especially in chronic inflammatory diseases. While the current therapies for cancer and several autoimmune disorders have revolutionized treatment outcomes, understanding the pathophysiological role of SDCs and the use of HSPG mimetic or antagonists on cytokine signaling networks may uncover potentially novel targeted therapeutic approaches. This review mainly summarizes the current findings on the role of individual SDCs in disease processes, mechanisms through which SDCs mediate their biological functions, and the possibility of targeting SDCs as future potential therapeutic approaches."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Syndecans are transmembrane proteoglycans that, together with integrins, control cell interactions with extracellular matrix components.

Despite structural similarities between all members of the syndecan family, their specific attachment to extracellular matrix proteins is defined by heparan and chondroitin chains. We postulate various unbinding kinetics for each type of single syndecan complex. Force spectroscopy data, recorded by atomic force microscope, were analyzed using two theoretical approaches describing force-induced unbinding, authored by Bell-Evans and Dudko-Hummer-Szabo. Our results reveal distinct unbinding pathways dependent on the syndecan family member. Syndecan-1 unbinds by passing over two energy barriers, inner and outer. Syndecan-4 unbinds by crossing over only one energy barrier. It has already been reported that both syndecans bear heparan chains that are structurally indistinguishable. Our finding reveals that unbinding of single syndecan complexes is family-member-dependent. Distinct unbinding pathways can be attributed to structural differences of heparan and chondroitin chains."}]},{"title":"yesno","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"PTEN is a potent tumour suppressor","answer_start":0}],"question":"Is PTEN a tumour suppressor?","id":"5e6df5b51af46fc130000025_001","is_impossible":false}],"context":"PTEN is a potent tumour suppressor, and its loss of function is frequently observed in both heritable and sporadic cancers. PTEN has phosphatase-dependent and phosphatase-independent (scaffold) activities in the cell and governs a variety of biological processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell survival, migration, proliferation and metabolism. Even a subtle decrease in PTEN levels and activity results in cancer susceptibility and favours tumour progression. Regulation of PTEN has therefore emerged as a subject of intense research in tumour biology. Recent discoveries, including the existence of distinct PTEN isoforms and the ability of PTEN to form dimers, have brought to light new modes of PTEN function and regulation. These milestone findings have in turn opened new therapeutic avenues for cancer prevention and treatment through restoration of PTEN tumour suppressor activity."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Genomic aberrations of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene are among the most common in prostate cancer.","answer_start":0}],"question":"Is PTEN a tumour suppressor?","id":"5e6df5b51af46fc130000025_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Genomic aberrations of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene are among the most common in prostate cancer. Inactivation of PTEN by deletion or mutation is identified in ∼20% of primary prostate tumour samples at radical prostatectomy and in as many as 50% of castration-resistant tumours. Loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) function leads to activation of the PI3K-AKT (phosphoinositide 3-kinase-RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase) pathway and is strongly associated with adverse oncological outcomes, making PTEN a potentially useful genomic marker to distinguish indolent from aggressive disease in patients with clinically localized tumours. At the other end of the disease spectrum, therapeutic compounds targeting nodes in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signalling pathway are being tested in clinical trials for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Knowledge of PTEN status might be helpful to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from these therapies. To enable the use of PTEN status as a prognostic and predictive biomarker, analytically validated assays have been developed for reliable and reproducible detection of PTEN loss in tumour tissue and in blood liquid biopsies. The use of clinical-grade assays in tumour tissue has shown a robust correlation between loss of PTEN and its protein as well as a strong association between PTEN loss and adverse pathological features and oncological outcomes. In advanced disease, assessing PTEN status in liquid biopsies shows promise in predicting response to targeted therapy. Finally, studies have shown that PTEN might have additional functions that are independent of the PI3K-AKT pathway, including those affecting tumour growth through modulation of the immune response and tumour microenvironment."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"BACKGROUND: Detection of a \"central vein sign\" (CVS) on FLAIR* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly specific and sensitive for multiple sclerosis (MS).

The Ets1 transcription factor acts in B cells to prevent PC differentiation. Ets1(-/-) mice accumulate PCs and produce autoantibodies. Ets1 expression is downregulated upon B cell activation through the BCR and TLRs and is maintained by the inhibitory signaling pathway mediated by Lyn, CD22 and SiglecG, and SHP-1. In the absence of these inhibitory components, Ets1 levels are reduced in B cells in a Btk-dependent manner. This leads to increased PCs, autoantibodies, and an autoimmune phenotype similar to that of Ets1(-/-) mice. Defects in inhibitory signaling molecules, including Lyn and Ets1, are associated with human lupus, although the effects are more subtle than the complete deficiency that occurs in knockout mice. In this study, we explore the effect of partial disruption of the Lyn/Ets1 pathway on B cell tolerance and find that Lyn(+/-)Ets1(+/-) mice demonstrate greater and earlier production of IgM, but not IgG, autoantibodies compared with Lyn(+/-) or Ets1(+/-) mice. We also show that Btk-dependent downregulation of Ets1 is important for normal PC homeostasis when inhibitory signaling is intact. Ets1 deficiency restores the decrease in steady state PCs and Ab levels observed in Btk(-/-) mice. Thus, depending on the balance of activating and inhibitory signals to Ets1, there is a continuum of effects on autoantibody production and PC maintenance.

Ultra-flexible vesicles, e.g. invasomes and core-multishell (CMS) nanotransporters are efficient drug delivery systems for dermatological applications. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic techniques were used for the determination of localization and distribution of the spin label 3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (PCA; logP=-1.7) within the carrier systems and the ability of the carriers to promote penetration of PCA into the skin. The results show an exclusive localization of PCA in the hydrophilic compartments of the invasome dispersion and the CMS nanotransporter solution. PCA penetration was enhanced 2.5 fold for CMS and 1.9 fold for invasomes compared to PCA solution. Investigation of penetration depth by step-wise removal of the stratum corneum by tape stripping revealed deepest PCA penetration for invasomes. UV-irradiation of PCA-exposed skin samples revealed that the spin label is still reactive.

Until now for all positive findings an intravenous application of the photosensitizer was mandatory. In the case of cutaneous malignant or non-malignant diseases a topical application of the drug onto the site of the disease followed by illumination, would be advantageous. Unfortunately, mTHPC is a highly hydrophobic drug with a low percutaneous absorption. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the photodynamic efficacy of novel mTHPC-loaded invasomes after their topical application onto the skin of mice bearing the subcutaneously implanted human colorectal tumour HT29 followed by photoirradiation. Invasomes are vesicles containing in addition to phospholipids a mixture of terpenes (cineole, citral and d-limonene) or only one terpene (citral) and ethanol, as penetration enhancers. This was a pilot study since until now no data are available about the efficacy of mTHPC in the photodynamic therapy of HT29 tumours after its topical application. The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether a mTHPC-loaded invasome formulation can reduce tumour size by photodynamic therapy or at least to find a formulation slowing down tumour growth compared to the control group (mice without any treatment).

Among them, 32 were from rodents or primates. Phylogenetic analyse showed a complex evolutionary history of this gene family. Some PTENps were shared both in primates and rodents. However, some PTENps were shown to be species-specific, such as the tasmanian devil PTENp1, nine banded armadillo PTENp1 and gibbon PTENp1. Most interestingly, the naked mole rat (NMR), an anticancer model organism, possessed 17 copies of PTENps, which were classified into four clades based on the phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, we found that all the 3'UTR of PTEN and PTENps shared common microRNA (MicroRNA) binding sites in NMR, based on our prediction of specific MicroRNA binding sites. Our findings suggested that multiple gene duplications have occurred in the formation of PTEN/PTENp gene family during the evolution of mammals. Some PTENps were relatively ancient and were shared by primates and rodents; others were newly originated through species- specific gene duplications. PTENps in NMR may function as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate their counterpart genes by competing for common MicroRNAs, which may be one of the interpretations for the cancer resistance in NMR."}]},{"title":"list","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"PURPOSES: To inform about a case of Revesz syndrome (RS) with initial ophthalmological symptomatology of severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy of the left eye (LE).

To ascertain the real impact of BANK1 on RA genetic susceptibility, we performed a large meta-analysis including our original data and tested for an epistatic interaction between BANK1 and BLK in RA susceptibility.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated data for 1,915 RA patients and 1,915 ethnically matched healthy controls genotyped for BANK1 rs10516487 and rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113. The association of each SNP and RA was tested by logistic regression. Multivariate analysis was then used with an interaction term to test for an epistatic interaction between the SNPs in the 2 genes.RESULTS: None of the SNPs tested individually was significantly associated with RA in the genotyped samples. However, we detected an epistatic interaction between BANK1 rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113 (P(interaction)  = 0.037).

Here we report a cancer mutational hotspot in MLL3 within the region encoding its plant homeodomain (PHD) repeats and demonstrate that this domain mediates association of MLL3 with the histone H2A deubiquitinase and tumor suppressor BAP1. Cancer-associated mutations in the sequence encoding the MLL3 PHD repeats disrupt the interaction between MLL3 and BAP1 and correlate with poor patient survival. Cancer cells that had PHD-associated MLL3 mutations or lacked BAP1 showed reduced recruitment of MLL3 and the H3K27 demethylase KDM6A (also known as UTX) to gene enhancers. As a result, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in tumor cells harboring BAP1 or MLL3 mutations restored normal gene expression patterns and impaired cell proliferation in vivo.

MRTF-A overexpression enhanced NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory transcription, whereas MRTF-A silencing inhibited this process. MRTF-A deficiency also reduced the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators in a mouse model of colitis. LPS promoted the recruitment of MRTF-A to the promoters of pro-inflammatory genes in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Reciprocally, MRTF-A influenced the nuclear enrichment and target binding of NF-κB.

Answers. We analyzed the datasets using a widely adopted biomedical text processing framework Apache cTAKES and its extension YTEX. First, we applied the named entity recognition (NER) method implemented in YTEX to identify UMLS concepts in the datasets. We then analyzed the coverage and the popularity of concepts in the UMLS source vocabularies across the 2 datasets (ie, blogs and social Q&A). Further, we conducted a concept-level comparative coverage analysis between SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and Open-Access Collaborative Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV)-the top 2 UMLS source vocabularies that have the most coverage on our datasets. We also analyzed the UMLS semantic types that were frequently observed in our datasets.RESULTS: We identified 2415 UMLS concepts from blog postings, 6452 UMLS concepts from social Q&A questions, and 10,378 UMLS concepts from the answers. The medical concepts identified in the blogs can be covered by 56 source vocabularies in the UMLS, while those in questions and answers can be covered by 58 source vocabularies. SNOMED CT was the dominant vocabulary in terms of coverage across all the datasets, ranging from 84.9% to 95.9%. It was followed by OAC CHV (between 73.5% and 80.0%) and Metathesaurus Names (MTH) (between 55.7% and 73.5%). All of the social media datasets shared frequent semantic types such as \"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein,\" \"Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component,\" and \"Disease or Syndrome.\"CONCLUSIONS: Although the 3 social media datasets vary greatly in size, they exhibited similar conceptual coverage among UMLS source vocabularies and the identified concepts showed similar semantic type distributions. As such, concepts that are both frequently used by consumers and also found in professional vocabularies such as SNOMED CT can be suggested to OAC CHV to improve its coverage.©Min Sook Park, Zhe He, Zhiwei Chen, Sanghee Oh, Jiang Bian.

The Open Access and Collaborative Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV), which contains health-related terms used by lay consumers, has been created to bridge such a gap. Specifically, the OAC CHV facilitates consumers' health information retrieval by enabling consumer-facing health applications to translate between professional language and consumer friendly language. To keep up with the constantly evolving medical knowledge and language use, new terms need to be identified and added to the OAC CHV. User-generated content on social media, including social question and answer (social Q&A) sites, afford us an enormous opportunity in mining consumer health terms. Existing methods of identifying new consumer terms from text typically use ad-hoc lexical syntactic patterns and human review. Our study extends an existing method by extracting n-grams from a social Q&A textual corpus and representing them with a rich set of contextual and syntactic features. Using K-means clustering, our method, simiTerm, was able to identify terms that are both contextually and syntactically similar to the existing OAC CHV terms.

SNAP-25 gene is associated with behavioral symptoms, personality and psychological disorders. In addition, SNAP-25 protein can be related to different neurotransmitter functions due to its association with vesicle membrane transition and fusion. This is important because neurologic, cognitive, and psychologic disorders in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) can be related to this function. This relationship may be enlightening for etiopathogenesis of FMS and treatment approaches. We aimed to study a SNAP-25 gene polymorphism, which is related to many psychiatric diseases, and FMS association in this prospective study.METHODS: We included 71 patients who were diagnosed according to new criteria and 57 matched healthy women in this study. Both groups were evaluated regarding age, height, weight, BMI, education level, marital and occupational status. A new diagnosis of FMS was made from criteria scoring, SF-36, Beck depression scale, and VAS that were applied to the patient group.

We show that, unexpectedly, halved SNAP-25 levels at 13-14 DIV not only fail to impair synaptic transmission but instead enhance evoked glutamatergic neurotransmission. This effect is possibly dependent on presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel activity and is not accompanied by changes in spontaneous quantal events or in the pool of readily releasable synaptic vesicles. Notably, synapses of 13-14 DIV neurons with reduced SNAP-25 expression show paired-pulse depression as opposed to paired-pulse facilitation occurring in their wild-type counterparts.

Inclusion criteria were studies including children with ITW diagnosis, reporting use of measurement tools or methods describing lower limb characteristics, published in peer-reviewed journals, and in English. The relevant psychometric properties of measurement tools were extracted, and assessed for reported reliability and validity. Included articles were assessed for risk of bias using McMaster quality assessment tool. Results were descriptively synthesized and logistic regression used to determine associations between common assessments.RESULTS: From 3164 retrieved studies, 37 full texts were screened and 27 full texts included. There were 27 different measurement tools described across joint range of motion measurement, gait analysis, electromyography, accelerometer, strength, neurological or radiology assessment. Interventional studies were more likely to report range of motion and gait analysis outcomes, than observational studies.

The diagnosis is clinical, making it necessary to rule out other neurological and orthopaedic conditions. A relationship between ITW and vestibular dysfunction and/or proprioceptive sensibility has been proposed. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders (autism, language and cognitive disorders) often have ITW.OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of ITW in children with attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity (ADHD).PATIENTS AND METHOD: A study was conducted on children diagnosed with ADHD, with normal neurological examination, with no alterations in MRI scan, cognitive disorder or autism. A complete clinical anamnesis was performed and Achilles shortening was measured with a goniometer.RESULTS: The study included 312 children with a mean age of 11 years (73.7% boys). The ADHD combined subtype was the most frequent (53.8%), followed by the inattentive (44.9%), and hyperactive (1.3%). ITW was observed in 20.8% of patients, particularly in the combined subtype (P=.054). Only 32 of them (49.2%) had Achilles shortening. ITW was associated with sociability disorders (P=.01), absence of pain in legs (P=.022), and family history of ITW (P=.004). Only 11% had previously visited a doctor for this reason.CONCLUSIONS: As in other neurodevelopmental disorders, children with ADHD have frequently more ITW and Achilles shortening than controls, especially if they presented with a social communication disorder or a family history of ITW. An early diagnosis is essential to establish effective treatments.Copyright © 2016 Asociación Española de Pediatría. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.

The cause of idiopathic toe walking is unknown, which hinders the development of treatment strategies. To test whether children with idiopathic toe walking have functional alterations in their spinal motor circuits, we studied the properties of the soleus H-reflex and its modulation with vibration in 26 idiopathic toe walkers and 16 typically developing children. At the group level, the H-reflex properties did not differ, but at the individual level, in 7 of 25 idiopathic toe walkers, some of the H-reflex parameters fell out of normal limits of typically developing children. However, the H-reflex was suppressed by vibration to the Achilles tendon similarly in both the idiopathic toe walkers and typically developing children.

This condition often causes parental concern, with repeated medical contacts and a range of interventions including stretching, casts, injection of botulinum toxin A, and surgical procedures. The purpose of this cohort study was to document the natural history of this condition.METHODS: In a population-based cohort of 1,401 healthy 5.5-year-old Swedish children, we found the prevalence of idiopathic toe-walking to be approximately 5% (63 of 1,401). Of the 63 children who had ever been a toe-walker, 26 still were at the age of 5.5 years and were followed in the current study at 8 and 10 years of age. At the 8-year follow-up, parents were asked by telephone whether their child had received any treatment or diagnosis since the 5.5-year assessment, as well as to what extent (approximately 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the time) the child still walked on the toes. At the visit when the children were 10 years of age, their parents were asked the same questions. All 26 children also underwent a neurological examination and an orthopaedic examination focusing on the lower extremities.RESULTS: At 8 years of age, 6 of 26 children had ceased toe-walking, and by the age of 10 years, 50 (79%) of the original 63 patients had spontaneously ceased toe-walking. Idiopathic toe-walking did not result in contractures of the triceps surae. One subgroup of children displayed early contracture of the ankle and should thus not be considered idiopathic toe-walkers. Four of the children who still toe-walked at the age of 10 years demonstrated some neurodevelopmental comorbidity.CONCLUSIONS: By the age of 10 years, 79% of the children who have ever been a toe-walker spontaneously develop a typical gait, without intervention or contractures of the ankle dorsiflexion. The diagnosis of short tendo Achilles should be retained as a separate diagnosis as there is a subset of children with this entity who should be treated early in childhood. Neurodevelopmental comorbidities are common among those who continue to toe-walk.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level I.

Treatment for toe walking includes physical therapy, orthotics, casting, Botulinum Toxin A injection into gastrocnemius/soleus muscles, and/or surgery; yet, little evidence exists regarding long-term treatment effects.RESEARCH QUESTION: The objective of this study was to explore the differences in longer-term gait outcomes and severity of idiopathic toe walking between children treated actively with casting or inactively following recommendations for stretching.METHODS: Forty-three adolescents and young adults (14.3-28.8 years; 21 females, 22 males) who had participated in an idiopathic toe walking classification study as children, returned for repeat physical examination and three-dimensional computerized gait analysis (13.4 years follow-up, range 9.4-17.8 years); 23 participants had received active treatment with casting and ankle foot orthotics ± Botulinum Toxin A injection as children and 20 participants had received inactive treatment with recommended stretching exercises. Gait analysis data were compared retrospectively from baseline to follow-up using analysis of variance; toe walking severity was compared using a Wilcoxin Signed-Rank Sums test.RESULTS: Ankle angle at initial contact, peak dorsiflexion in stance, and toe walking severity improved significantly in the active treatment group only at follow-up. Significant improvement in peak ankle power and timing of ankle kinematics and kinetics in the gait cycle were found in both groups; however, greater changes occurred in the active treatment group. Both groups showed significantly improved internal plantar flexor moments, whereas knee extension increased in stance and passive ankle dorsiflexion decreased in both groups at follow-up (p = 0.001). Intermittent toe walking was reported in 49% (21/43) of participants at follow-up.SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study suggest that improvement in ankle kinematic timing and ankle kinetic gait analysis variables is sustainable, independent of conservative treatment for idiopathic toe walking in childhood.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SATB1 binds to MARs within the MMTV provirus to repress transcription. To address the role of the nuclear matrix in SATB1-mediated repression, a series of SATB1 deletion constructs was used to determine protein localization. Wild-type SATB1 localized to the soluble nuclear, chromatin, and nuclear matrix fractions. Mutants lacking amino acids 224-278 had a greatly diminished localization to the nuclear matrix, suggesting the presence of a nuclear matrix targeting sequence (NMTS). Transient transfection experiments showed that NMTS fusions to green fluorescent protein or LexA relocalized these proteins to the nuclear matrix. Difficulties with previous assay systems prompted us to develop retroviral vectors to assess effects of different SATB1 domains on expression of MMTV proviruses or integrated reporter genes. SATB1 overexpression repressed MMTV transcription in the presence and absence of functional glucocorticoid receptor. Repression was alleviated by deletion of the NMTS, which did not affect DNA binding, or by deletion of the MAR-binding domain.

Current approaches for comparing the expression profiles are based on pairwise connectivity mapping analysis.

Since many compounds can bind multiple targets, the pairwise mapping ignores the combined effects of multiple targets, and therefore fails to detect many potential targets of the compounds.RESULTS: We propose an algorithm to find sets of gene knock-downs that induce gene expression changes similar to a drug treatment. Assuming that the effects of gene knock-downs are additive, we propose a novel bipartite block-wise sparse multi-task learning model with super-graph structure (BBSS-MTL) for multi-target drug repositioning that overcomes the restrictive assumptions of connectivity mapping analysis.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method BBSS-MTL is more accurate for predicting potential drug targets than the simple pairwise connectivity mapping analysis on five datasets generated from different cancer cell lines.AVAILABILITY: The code can be obtained at http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/liminli/codes ."}]},{"title":"yesno","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and XIAP) ","answer_start":1002}],"question":"Is the protein MCL-1 anti-apoptotic?","id":"5e6e8600c6a8763d23000002_001","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Fenvalerate (Fen), a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used in agricultural, domestic and veterinary applications.

Here, we have developed a novel irreversible BTK inhibitor, PLS-123, that has more potent and selective anti-tumor activity than ibrutinib in vitro and in vivo. Using in vitro screening, we discovered that the combination of PLS-123 and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus exert synergistic activity in attenuating proliferation and motility of MCL cell lines. Simultaneous inhibition of BTK and mTOR resulted in marked induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, which were accompanied by upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved PARP and Bax), repression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and XIAP), and downregulation of regulators of the G1/S phase transition (CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and Cyclin D1).

Despite their similarities, there is emerging evidence for non-redundant roles of the circulating yet scarce basophils and tissue-resident mast cells, respectively. Because of their importance in allergic pathogenesis, specific induction of apoptosis in basophils and mast cells may represent an interesting novel treatment strategy. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-3 serves as a key factor for basophil and mouse mast cell survival. Interleukin-3 increases the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, such as BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1; however, little is known how strongly these individual proteins contribute to basophil survival. Here, we were applying small molecule inhibitors called BH3 mimetics, some of which show remarkable success in cancer treatments, to neutralize the function of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. We observed that expression levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins do not necessarily correlate with their respective importance for basophil survival. Whereas naive in vitro-differentiated mouse basophils efficiently died upon BCL-2 or BCL-XL inhibition, interleukin-3 priming rendered the cells highly resistant toward apoptosis, and this could only be overcome upon combined targeting of BCL-2 and BCL-XL. Of note, human basophils differed from mouse basophils as they depended on BCL-2 and MCL-1, but not on BCL-XL, for their survival at steady state. On the other hand, and in contrast to mouse basophils, MCL-1 proved critical in mediating survival of interleukin-3 stimulated mouse mast cells, whereas BCL-XL seemed dispensable. Taken together, our results indicate that by choosing the right combination of BH3 mimetic compounds, basophils and mast cells can be efficiently killed, even after stimulation with potent pro-survival cytokines such as interleukin-3. Because of the tolerable side effects of BH3 mimetics, targeting basophils or mast cells for apoptosis opens interesting possibilities for novel treatment approaches."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"CONTENT: Although CD19-targeted agents (blinatumomab or inebilizumab) are not associated with an increased risk of infection, they may cause IgG hypogammaglobulinaemia and neutropenia.","answer_start":443}],"question":"What is the target of Inebilizumab?","id":"5e47681b35b8f0833c000006_001","is_impossible":false}],"context":"BACKGROUND: The present review is part of the ESCMID Study Group for Infections in Compromised Hosts (ESGICH) Consensus Document on the safety of targeted and biological therapies.AIMS: To review, from an Infectious Diseases perspective, the safety profile of agents targeting CD19, CD20 and CD52 and to suggest preventive recommendations.SOURCES: Computer-based MEDLINE searches with MeSH terms pertaining to each agent or therapeutic family.CONTENT: Although CD19-targeted agents (blinatumomab or inebilizumab) are not associated with an increased risk of infection, they may cause IgG hypogammaglobulinaemia and neutropenia.

CD19 inhibition in mice reduced skin thickness, collagen production, and autoantibody levels, consistent with CD19 expression on plasma cells (PCs), the source of antibody production. PC depletion could effectively reduce collagen deposition and inflammation in SSc; therefore, we investigated the effects of PC depletion on SSc disease activity.METHODS: A PC gene signature was evaluated in SSc skin biopsy samples in 2 phase I clinical trials. We assessed microarray data from tissue from public studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), dermatomyositis (DM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and atopic dermatitis, as well as blood from a phase IIb clinical trial in SLE.RESULTS: The PC signature was elevated in SSc skin specimens compared to healthy donor skin (P = 2.28 × 10-6 ) and correlated with the baseline modified Rodnan skin thickness score (MRSS) (r = 0.64, P = 0.0004).

The lower expression of Xlr on day 13 of fetal development, the bright Thy1+ phenotype of Xlr-positive cells, their large size, and their absence from subcapsular areas suggest that Xlr expression must be turned on within the thymus and not in prethymic precursors. From day 16 of gestation, Xlr expression decreased markedly. At birth and later, Xlr(high) cells were mostly large cells scattered throughout the cortical area.

Subsequently, 849 of these study participants were given a fourth dose of DTaP(5) and Hib vaccines or a fourth dose of DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib at 1 to 16 months of age. Safety was monitored throughout the study, and blood specimens were obtained to assess antibody responses.RESULTS: DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib elicited similar or fewer solicited injection-site and systemic reactions as compared with the separate administration of US-licensed DTaP(5), IPV, and Hib vaccines. Seroresponse and seroprotection rates elicited by DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib were noninferior to US-licensed equivalent vaccines after the infant series and after the fourth dose. Children immunized with DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib had higher antibody geometric mean concentrations to pertussis toxoid and filamentous hemagglutinin; children immunized with the separate vaccines had higher responses to pertactin. Hib antibody responses to Hib polysaccharide were nearly identical in the DTaP(5)-IPV-Hib and separate-vaccine groups.

We found the BH3 mimetic combination kill both the MICs and non-MICs (bulk of melanoma) in all cell lines and patient samples irrespective of the mutation status or relapsed state (p < 0.05). Unexpectedly, the major pro-apoptotic proteins, NOXA and BIM, are not necessary for the combination-induced cell death. Furthermore, the combination impedes the activation of DRP-1, and inhibition of DRP-1 further enhances apoptosis (p < 0.05). DRP-1 effects in melanoma differ from those seen in other cancer cells. These results provide new insights into BCL-2 family's regulation of the apoptotic pathway in melanoma, and suggest that inhibiting the major anti-apoptotic proteins is sufficient to induce cell death even without involvement from major pro-apoptotic proteins.

Previous studies have shown that while treatment of NPC cells with Bcl-2 family inhibitors alone is rarely effective, concomitant treatment with a cytotoxic reagent such as cisplatin can increase efficacy through a synergistic effect. The aim of the current work was to determine how we might increase the efficacy of Bcl-2 family inhibitors in the absence of cytotoxic reagents, which are associated with negative side effect profiles.METHODS: We assessed cell proliferation in Bcl-2 high-expressing NPC cells by CCK-8 assay after treatment with the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 and/or the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845. Apoptotic induction by ABT-199 was evaluated by Annexin V-FITC and PI double staining. We also evaluated Bcl-2 family protein expression (Bim, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, Noxa) after treatment with ABT-199 by western blotting. Finally, xenografted Balb/c nude mice were used to test ABT-199 efficacy in vivo, H&E and immunohistochemistry assay were used to analyze tumor samples.RESULTS: ABT-199 effectively induced NPC cell apoptosis in vitro and in the xenograft model. Following ABT-199 treatment in NPC cells, upregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL can lead to drug resistance, while concomitant Noxa overexpression partially neutralized the Mcl-1-caused resistance. Given that ABT-199 induces apoptosis in NPC cells through the Bcl-2/Noxa/Mcl-1 axis, treatment avenues further targeting this pathway should be promising. Indeed, the newly developed Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 in combination with ABT-199 had a synergistic effect on NPC cell apoptosis.CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 inhibition in NPC cells with ABT-199 triggers apoptosis through the Bcl-2/Noxa/Mcl-1 axis, and dual inhibition of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 provided a strong synergistic effect without the need for adjunctive cytotoxic agent treatment with cisplatin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

BH3-mimetics that inhibit specific BCL-2 anti-apoptotic proteins may hold encouraging treatment outcomes for cervical cancer management. Hence, the aim of this pilot study is to investigate the sensitivity of cervical cancer cell lines to combination of two BH3-mimetics namely ABT-263 which selectively inhibits BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-w and A-1210477, a selective MCL-1 inhibitor.RESULTS: We report that combination of A-1210477 and ABT-263 exhibited synergistic effects on all cervical cancer cell lines tested. Drug sensitization studies revealed that A-1210477 sensitised the cervical cancer cell lines SiHa and CaSki to ABT-263 by 11- and fivefold, respectively. Sensitization also occurred in the opposite direction whereby ABT-263 sensitised SiHa and CaSki to A-1210477 by eightfold.

To address these questions, we developed a Bayesian network model for interactions among different histone modifications across neighboring nucleosomes, based on the framework of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). From this model, we found that robust inter-nucleosomal interactions exist around transcription start site (TSS), transcription termination sites (TTS) or around CTCF binding sites; and these inter-nucleosomal interactions are often involved in transcription regulation. In addition to these general principles, DBN also uncovered a novel specific epigenetic interaction between H2A.Z and H4K20me1 on neighboring nucleosomes, involved in nucleosome free region (NFR) and nucleosome phasing establishment or maintenance. The level of negative correlation between neighboring H2A.Z and H4K20me1 strongly correlate with the size of NFR and the strength of nucleosome phasing around TSS.

The expression levels of the lncRNA NR_036575.1 were significantly higher in PTC tissues than in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. High NR_036575.1 expression was associated with extrathyroidal extension (ETE) (P = 0.011) and tumour size (P = 0.006). The ROC curves indicated that NR_036575.1 could potentially serve as a biomarker for identifying PTC and related, non-cancerous diseases (sensitivity, 80.7 %; specificity, 88 %), as well as for differentiating between PTC with or without ETE (sensitivity, 57.8 %; specificity, 86.7 %). NR_036575.1 knock-down significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of TPC1 cells. Our findings are the first to describe lncRNA NR_036575.1 overexpression in PTC. NR_036575.1 expression was associated with both ETE and tumour size. In addition, NR_036575.1 modulation could regulate TPC1 cell proliferation and migration.

The biological function of lncRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the dysfunction of lncRNA in OSCC.RESULTS: We analyzed the transcriptome profiles of human OSCC tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues from two patients through a next-generation sequencing approach. A total of 14 lncRNAs were upregulated (fold change ≥3) and 13 were downregulated (fold change ≤-3) in OSCC tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. SOX21-AS1 was subjected to further analysis, revealing that the expression levels of SOX21-AS1 significantly decreased in OSCC compared with the adjacent normal tissue. The promoter activity of SOX21-AS1 was obviously suppressed by in vitro methylation. The DNA methylation status of the SOX21-AS1 promoter was analyzed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis, revealing that the aberrant promoter hypermethylation of SOX21-AS1 was observed frequently in OSCC tissues. The effects of SOX21-AS1 on cell proliferation and invasion were examined through transient transfection. Our data showed that SOX21-AS1 could significantly suppress oral cancer cell growth and invasion. Furthermore, the low expression level of SOX21-AS1 was significantly correlated with an advanced stage (P = 0.047), large tumor size (P = 0.033), and poor disease-specific survival in OSCC patients (P = 0.002).CONCLUSIONS: SOX21-AS1 was identified as susceptible dysfunction correlated with promoter hypermethylation in OSCC.

It is an orally active metalloprotease inhibitor of the same class as batimastat, and is the first compound in this class to have completed a pivotal clinical trial. Marimastat also has collagenase- and angiogenesis-inhibiting properties. British Biotech and Schering-Plough have signed an agreement enabling the latter to develop and market marimastat in North America and Europe. Under the terms of the agreement, British Biotech will receive an up-front license fee of 4 million US dollars and a 4 million US dollars equity investment in British Biotech by Schering-Plough. Schering-Plough holds rights to marimastat in all countries other than the Far East and Japan. The two companies are considering asking the FDA for accelerated approval in gastric cancer based on the secondary endpoint of progression-free survival. Marimastat is licensed to Tanabe Seiyaku in Japan, where phase II clinical trials are underway for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer and lung cancer. Further phase II trials in other tumour types are planned. The commencement of phase II trials in Japan resulted in a milestone payment of 5 million US dollars to British Biotech from Tanabe Seiyaku. Tanabe Seiyaku also holds rights to marimastat in the Far East. Marimastat has been in pivotal phase III trials in glioblastoma, breast, ovarian and small and non-small cell lung cancer, but these trials have all been discontinued because marimastat failed to show superior efficacy over either standard chemotherapy or placebo. Results from the marimastat 131 trial in patients with glioblastoma, for example, indicated that marimastat was no better than placebo at prolonging survival in these cancer patients. In June 2000, when the results of this study were released, shares in British Biotech fell 21.6% to just 19 pence per share. The phase III trial in small cell lung cancer was discontinued when the results of study 140 were released in February 2001 showing that marimastat was not significantly more effective than placebo in prolonging the survival of small cell lung cancer patients. The results of this study were consistent with those reported in study 117. British Biotech has also conducted a phase III placebo-controlled study of marimastat as monotherapy in patients with inoperable gastric cancer at 37 centres throughout Europe. Results from this trial indicated that it did not achieve its primary endpoint of a statistically significant survival benefit over placebo. However, data collected during the follow-up period have shown increases in survival benefit in the treatment group in addition to a significant improvement in disease-free progression, the secondary endpoint of the trial. Development of marimastat for this indication is ongoing. In May 2001, British Biotech reported data from an interim analysis of results from the remaining phase III study in pancreatic cancer (study 183) that showed no patient benefit for marimastat recipients compared with gemcitabine. However, these results did not meet stopping criteria and the study continues under the guidance of Schering-Plough. The multicentre trials are being conducted in the US, Canada and the European Union. The phase III trial of marimastat in combination with carboplatin that was being conducted in patients with ovarian cancer was discontinued because British Biotech realised that the design of the trial was insufficient for registration in the US or Europe. Altogether, seven phase III studies have failed to meet their primary end-points, but the company has stated that the effectiveness of marimastat is more likely to be seen in patients with less advanced disease.

Not all lung cancers express the MMPs believed to be most important in promoting the neoplastic process, and there are conflicting reports regarding the prognostic significance of MMPs in lung cancer. However, it is possible that these observations are because of limitations in the procedures for measuring MMPs. Many investigators believe that MMPs are universally involved in tumor progression; this hypothesis was the basis for initiating seven phase III MMPI trials in lung cancer. Four studies were closed at completion of the predefined accrual goal, and three were closed early.

One of the earliest postzygotic isolating barriers to arise between incipient species is the sterility of the heterogametic sex in interspecies' hybrids. Four genes that underlie hybrid sterility have been identified in animals: Odysseus, JYalpha, and Overdrive in Drosophila and Prdm9 (Meisetz) in mice. Mouse Prdm9 encodes a protein with a KRAB motif, a histone methyltransferase domain and several zinc fingers. The difference of a single zinc finger distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid sterility from those that do not. We find that concerted evolution and positive selection have rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc fingers across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of positive selection in Prdm9 zinc fingers imply that rapid evolution has acted on the interface between the Prdm9 protein and the DNA sequences to which it binds. Similar patterns are apparent for Prdm9 zinc fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates. Indeed, allelic variation at the DNA-binding positions of human PRDM9 zinc fingers show significant association with decreased risk of infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a role in determining male sterility both between species (mouse) and within species (human). The recurrent episodes of positive selection acting on Prdm9 suggest that the DNA sequences to which it binds must also be evolving rapidly. Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying DNA sequences, but argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical model in which incompatibilities between Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite DNAs provide the molecular basis for Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility.

Evidence of a reduction in carriage acquisition of invasive group B meningococcal strains, after vaccination among adolescents, is imperative if routine immunization is to drive population control of disease beyond those who are vaccinated (i.e. through herd immunity). The need for multiple doses to generate a sufficiently protective response and reactogenicity remain significant problems with the new generation of vaccines.

Chromatin was replicated in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate; isolated nucleosomes were stripped of linker histone, reconstituted with H1, and treated to produce Mg(2+)-soluble and Mg(2+)-insoluble chromatin fractions. Following the removal of H1, all solubility differences between chromatin replicated in sodium butyrate for 30 min (bu-chromatin) and control chromatin were lost. Reconstitution with H1 completely restored the preferential Mg(2+)-solubility of bu-chromatin, demonstrating that a reduced capacity for aggregation/condensation is an inherent feature of acetylated nascent nucleosomes; however, titration with excess H1 caused the solubility differences to be lost again. Moreover, when the core histone N-terminal \"tails\" (the sites of acetylation) were removed by trypsinization prior to reconstitution, H1 was unable to reestablish the altered solubility of chromatin replicated in butyrate. Thus, the core histone \"tails,\" and the acetylation thereof, not only modulate H1-mediated nucleosome interactions in vitro, but also strongly influence the ability of H1 to differentiate between new and old nucleosomes.

DSB clusters can destabilize chromatin locally and compromise processing of individual DSBs within the cluster. Since the discovery of chromothripsis, a phenomenon whereby multiple DSBs locally generated by a catastrophic event causes genomic rearrangements that feed carcinogenesis, DSB clusters receive increased attention also in the field of cancer. While formation of DSB clusters after exposure to high LET is a direct and inherent consequence of the spatial distribution of the constituting energy deposition events, also called track structure, the sources of local genomic shattering underpinning chromothripsis are under investigation. Notably, many consequences of DSB clusters in the affected genome reflect processing by pathways that have evolved to repair DSBs, but which operate with widely different degrees of fidelity. The molecular underpinnings and the basis of the underlying repair pathway choices that ultimately lead to the observed consequences from DSB clusters remain unknown. We developed a tractable model of DSB clustering that allows direct analysis in cells of the consequences of certain configurations of DSB clusters. We outline the rationale for the development of this model and describe its key characteristics. We summarize results suggesting that DSB clusters compromise the first-line DSB-processing pathways of c-NHEJ and HRR, increasing as a consequence the contribution of alt-EJ, which has high propensity of generating chromosomal rearrangements.

At least part of the problem is technical; it is difficult to detect and quantify interstrand cross-links when the same agent forms both cross-links and single strand breaks because the detection of interstrand cross-links generally involves a denaturation step. Our group has studied the induction of interstrand cross-links following irradiation of DNA containing bromouracil at specific sites. We found that the formation of interstrand cross-links requires the presence of a few (3-5) mismatched bases, comprising the bromouracil. In the absence of mismatched bases, no radiation-induced cross-linking was observed; however, even in the absence of bromouracil, cross-linking still occurred, albeit at a lower efficiency. Our molecular modelling studies demonstrate that the mobility of the bases in the mismatched region is essential for the cross-linking process. Thus, our hypothesis is that ionizing radiation induces DNA interstrand cross-links in non-hybridized regions of DNA. Some obvious examples of such DNA regions are replication forks, transcription bubbles and the D-loop of telomeres. However, an abundance of studies have made it clear that there must be many single-stranded regions in the genome, such as hairpins and cruciforms. For example, alpha satellite DNA, in centromere regions of human chromosomes, forms hairpins. Thus, a variety of non-B DNA structures (hairpins, slipped DNA and tetrahelical structures) exist in the genome and should be susceptible to the formation of radiation-induced interstrand cross-links. Although interstrand cross-links have thus far been virtually ignored in radiation biology, it will be worthwhile to develop methods to detect their presence following exposure of cells to biologically relevant levels of ionizing radiation, since, on a per lesions basis, they are probably more toxic than double-strand breaks."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"While much is known about radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair, ","answer_start":0}],"question":"Are breaks in double stranded DNA associated with ionizing radiation?","id":"5e3c6e15b5b409ea53000023_004","is_impossible":false}],"context":"While much is known about radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair, the question of how deletions of different sizes arise as a result of the processing of DSBs by the cell's repair systems has not been fully answered. In order to bridge this gap between DSBs and deletions, we critically reviewed published data on mechanisms pertaining to: (a) repair of DNA DSBs (from basic studies in this area); (b) formation of naturally occurring structural variation (SV) - especially of deletions - in the human genome (from genomic studies) and (c) radiation-induced mutations and structural chromosomal aberrations in mammalian somatic cells (from radiation mutagenesis and radiation cytogenetic studies). The specific aim was to assess the relative importance of the postulated mechanisms in generating deletions in the human genome and examine whether empirical data on radiation-induced deletions in mouse germ cells are consistent with predictions of these mechanisms. The mechanisms include (a) NHEJ, a DSB repair process that does not require any homology and which functions in all stages of the cell cycle (and is of particular relevance in G0/G1); (b) MMEJ, also a DSB repair process but which requires microhomology and which presumably functions in all cell cycle stages; (c) NAHR, a recombination-based DSB repair mechanism which operates in prophase I of meiosis in germ cells; (d) MMBIR, a microhomology-mediated, replication-based mechanism which operates in the S phase of the cell cycle, and (e) strand slippage during replication (involved in the origin of small insertions and deletions (INDELs). Our analysis permits the inference that, between them, these five mechanisms can explain nearly all naturally occurring deletions of different sizes identified in the human genome, NAHR and MMBIR being potentially more versatile in this regard. With respect to radiation-induced deletions, the basic studies suggest that those arising as a result of the operation of NHEJ/MMEJ processes, as currently formulated, are expected to be relatively small. However, data on induced mutations in mouse spermatogonial stem cells (irradiation in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and DSB repair presumed to be via NHEJ predominantly) show that most are associated with deletions of different sizes, some in the megabase range. There is thus a 'discrepancy' between what the basic studies suggest and the empirical observations in mutagenesis studies. This discrepancy, however, is only an apparent but not a real one. It can be resolved by considering the issue of deletions in the broader context of and in conjunction with the organization of chromatin in chromosomes and nuclear architecture, the conceptual framework for which already exists in studies carried out during the past fifteen years or so. In this paper, we specifically hypothesize that repair of DSBs induced in chromatin loops may offer a basis to explain the induction of deletions of different sizes and suggest an approach to test the hypothesis. We emphasize that the bridging of the gap between induced DSB and resulting deletions of different sizes is critical for current efforts in computational modeling of genetic risks."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The highly variable phenotypes observed in patients with classic Bartter's syndrome (BS) remain unsatisfactorily explained.

The wide spectrum of functional severity of CLCNKB mutations may contribute to the phenotypic variability, and the genotype-phenotype association has not been established. Low-level expression of the human ClC-Kb channel in mammalian cells impedes the functional study of CLCNKB mutations, and the underlying cause is still unclear. The human ClC-Kb channel is highly degraded by proteasome in human embryonic kidney cells. The C-terminal in-frame green fluorescent protein fusion may slow down the proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Barttin co-expression necessarily improves the stability, membrane trafficking and gating of ClC-Kb. CLCNKB mutations in barttin-binding sites, dimer interface or selectivity filter often have severe functional consequences. The remaining chloride conductance of the ClC-Kb mutant channel significantly correlates with the phenotypes, such as age at diagnosis, plasma chloride concentration, and the degree of calciuria in patients with classic BS.ABSTRACT: Mutations in the CLCNKB gene encoding the human voltage-gated chloride ClC-Kb (hClC-Kb) channel cause classic Bartter's syndrome (BS). In contrast to antenatal BS, classic BS manifests with highly variable phenotypes. The functional severity of the mutant channel has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Due to difficulties in the expression of hClC-Kb in heterologous expression systems, the functional consequences of mutant channels have not been thoroughly examined, and the genotype-phenotype association has not been established. In this study, we found that hClC-Kb, when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, was unstable due to degradation by proteasome. In-frame fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus of the channel may ameliorate proteasome degradation. Co-expression of barttin increased protein abundance and membrane trafficking of hClC-Kb and markedly increased functional chloride current. We then functionally characterized 18 missense mutations identified in our classic BS cohort and others using HEK cells expressing hClC-Kb-GFP. Most CLCNKB mutations resulted in marked reduction in protein abundance and chloride current, especially those residing at barttin binding sites, dimer interface and selectivity filter. We enrolled classic BS patients carrying homozygous missense mutations with well-described functional consequences and clinical presentations for genotype-phenotype analysis. We found significant correlations of mutant chloride current with the age at diagnosis, plasma chloride concentration and urine calcium excretion rate. In conclusion, hClC-Kb expression in HEK cells is susceptible to proteasome degradation, and fusion of GFP to the C-terminus of hClC-Kb improves protein expression. The functional severity of the CLCNKB mutation is an important determinant of the phenotype in classic BS.© 2017 The Authors.

Gitelman's syndrome results from mutations in the SLC12A3 gene encoding the human thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter, leading to impaired reabsorption of sodium chloride in the distal convoluted tubule. Genetic heterogeneity of hyperprostaglandin E syndrome has been demonstrated by identification of mutations in the SLC12A1 gene as well as in the KCNJ1 gene.

Patients most often present with a relapsing-remitting disease course, typically progressing over time to a phase of relentless advancement in secondary progressive MS (SPMS), for which approved disease-modifying therapies are limited. In this review, we summarize the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of SPMS and the rationale and clinical potential for natalizumab, which is currently approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to exert beneficial effects in reducing disease progression unrelated to relapses in SPMS. In both forms of MS, active brain-tissue injury is associated with inflammation; but in SPMS, the inflammatory response occurs at least partly behind the blood-brain barrier and is followed by a cascade of events, including persistent microglial activation that may lead to chronic demyelination and neurodegeneration associated with irreversible disability. In patients with relapsing forms of MS, natalizumab therapy is known to significantly reduce intrathecal inflammatory responses which results in reductions in brain lesions and brain atrophy as well as beneficial effects on clinical measures, such as reduced frequency and severity of relapse and reduced accumulation of disability. Natalizumab treatment also reduces levels of cerebrospinal fluid chemokines and other biomarkers of intrathecal inflammation, axonal damage and demyelination, and has demonstrated the ability to reduce innate immune activation and intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis in patients with MS. The efficacy of natalizumab therapy in SPMS is currently being investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial."}]},{"title":"yesno","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"In contrast, the upstream nucleosome which covers the TATA box under repressed conditions is shifted approximately 50 bp further upstream by the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler RSC upon activation.

Hog1 targets the RSC chromatin remodeling complex to stress-responsive genes and rsc deficient cells display reduced induction of gene expression. Here we show that the absence of H3K4 methylation, either achieved by deletion of the SET1 methyltransferase or by amino acid substitution of H3K4, bypasses the requirement of RSC for stress-responsive gene expression. Monomethylation of H3K4 is specifically inhibiting RSC-independent chromatin remodeling and thus, it prevents osmostress-induced gene expression. The absence of H3K4 monomethylation permits that the association of alternative remodelers with stress-responsive genes and the Swr1 complex (SWR-C) is instrumental in the induction of gene expression upon stress. Accordingly, the absence of SWR-C or histone H2A.Z results in compromised chromatin remodeling and impaired gene expression in the absence of RSC and H3K4 methylation. These results indicate that expression of stress-responsive genes is controlled by two remodeling mechanisms: RSC in the presence of monomethylated H3K4, and SWR-C in the absence of H3K4 monomethylation.

Solid-state coating morphology of PTH(1-34) on microprojection arrays was determined by SEM, and stability on storage was assessed after dissolution and testing with stability indicating assays. Internal vapor analysis was performed to detect and quantify volatile organics released by patch components into the headspace inside the final package.RESULTS: Aggregation and oxidation were the primary degradation mechanisms for solid-state PTH(1-34) in this transdermal delivery system. Although these two degradation pathways can be retarded by appropriate stabilizers and use of foil pouch packaging (nitrogen purged and desiccant), the solid-state drug formulation's compatibility with patch components, particularly the plastic retainer ring, surprisingly dictated PTH(1-34) stability. Internal vapor analysis demonstrated that PTH(1-34) was particularly vulnerable to vapors such as moisture, oxygen, and outgassed formaldehyde, and each of these volatiles played a unique and significant role in PTH(1-34)'s degradation mechanism.CONCLUSIONS: Identifying degradation mechanisms of volatile compounds on solid-state PTH(1-34) peptide stability allowed for the rationale for selection of final formulation, system components and packaging conditions.

Although the connection between repeated concussions and CTE-type neurodegeneration has been recently proposed, this causal relationship has not yet been firmly established. Also, the prevalence of CTE among athletes with multiple concussions is unknown.METHODS: We performed a consecutive case series brain autopsy study on six retired professional football players from the Canadian Football League (CFL) with histories of multiple concussions and significant neurological decline.RESULTS: All participants had progressive neurocognitive decline prior to death; however, only 3 cases had post-mortem neuropathological findings consistent with CTE.

Moreover, the CTE cases showed co-morbid pathology of cancer, vascular disease, and AD.DISCUSSION: Our case studies highlight that not all athletes with history of repeated concussions and neurological symptomology present neuropathological changes of CTE. These preliminary findings support the need for further research into the link between concussion and CTE as well as the need to expand the research to other possible causes of taupathy in athletes.

No difference in the gene frequency of the two base-pair polymorphism in SLE patients compared to controls was found, nor was there any association with any particular clinical phenotype."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":" In conclusion, the TNFR2 196R allele was found to be significantly associated with the susceptibility to SLE in the Japanese population.

A number of previous studies have suggested a possible role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the pathogenesis of SLE. In addition, one of the candidate loci suggested by the genome-wide linkage analysis corresponds to the chromosomal position encompassing the TNF receptor 2 gene (TNFR2). The purpose of this study was to analyze the polymorphism of TNFR2 and its possible association with the susceptibility to SLE, using the case-control association analysis. Polymorphism screening of the exons containing previously reported nonsynonymous base substitutions was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method, using genomic DNA from 81 Japanese patients with SLE and 207 healthy individuals. Two alleles were present in exon 6, coding for methionine (196M) and arginine (196R) at position 196. 30 of 81 patients (37.0%) with SLE were positive for the 196R allele, which was significantly more frequent compared with 39 of 207 healthy individuals (18.8%) (chi2=10.6, df=l, P=0.001, odds ratio=2.53, 95% CI: 1.45-4.43). Genotype analysis revealed that the presence of one 196R allele was sufficient for rendering susceptibility. The association of 196R allele with SLE was independent from that of HLA-DRB1*1501. In conclusion, the TNFR2 196R allele was found to be significantly associated with the susceptibility to SLE in the Japanese population.

The aim of the present study was to investigate cell cycle reactivation during tau hyperphosphorylation in primary hippocampal neurons. We used forskolin, a specific activator of PKA, to induce tau hyperphosphorylation in cultured primary hippocampal neurons, and then measured levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1. We found that forskolin induced hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser214, Ser396, and Ser202/Thr205 sites, attaining peak levels at 6, 12, and 12 h, respectively, while returning to normal levels at 24 h. Forskolin also induced a sustained cAMP elevation and PKA activation, which peaked at 6 h, in association with activation and overexpression of protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) at 24 h. The tau hyperphosphorylation was accompanied by increases in cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 levels; immunostaining showed overlapping distribution of hyperphosphorylated tau and cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 in primary hippocampal neurons. Forskolin induced hyperphosphorylation of tau and increased cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 protein levels in HEK293/tau441 cells, but not in the HEK293/vector cells, whereas the PKA inhibitor H89 inhibited the effects of forskolin on tau hyperphosphorylation and cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 protein levels.

In this article, we would like to formulate the hypothesis that arsenic may cause MS by induction of inflammation, degeneration, and apoptosis in neuronal cells. The induction of ROS generation in cells upon exposure to arsenic as a heavy metal may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Tau protein, a member of the family of microtubule-associated proteins, is mainly expressed in neurons and contribute to the assembly of neuronal microtubules network. Arsenic may affect the hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau proteins and may be involved in the cascade leading to deregulation of tau function associated with neurodegeneration. For validation of this hypothesis, studies might be conducted to evaluate the association of arsenic levels and tau protein levels in MS patients. Further studies might also focus on the trafficking along microtubules in neurons of MS patient with regard to hyperphosphorylation of tau protein.

It is characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of cognitive abilities and formation of senile plaques, composed mainly of amyloid β (Aβ), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of tau protein, in the hippocampus and cortex of afflicted humans. In brains of AD patients the metabolism of Aβ is dysregulated, which leads to the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ. Metabolism of Aβ and tau proteins is crucially influenced by autophagy. Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent, homeostatic process, in which organelles and proteins are degraded and recycled into energy. Thus, dysfunction of autophagy is suggested to lead to the accretion of noxious proteins in the AD brain. In the present review, we describe the process of autophagy and its importance in AD. Additionally, we discuss mechanisms and genes linking autophagy and AD, i.e., the mTOR pathway, neuroinflammation, endocannabinoid system, ATG7, BCL2, BECN1, CDK5, CLU, CTSD, FOXO1, GFAP, ITPR1, MAPT, PSEN1, SNCA, UBQLN1, and UCHL1.

Although rarely reported, MAS might occur in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), notably as an inaugural manifestation. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the cornerstone of SLE therapy. However, in some cases high doses of GCs are required to achieve remission (i.e. glucocorticoid-resistance), leading to significant side effects.CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old Romani male was admitted to our hospital for polyarthralgia, polyserositis and fatigability. The patient had high-grade fever, jaundice and generalized lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests revealed severe mixed hemolytic autoimmune anemia, leukopenia, hepatocytolysis, coagulation abnormalities, hypertriglyceridemia, biological inflammatory syndrome, hyperferritinemia and persistent proteinuria of nephritic pattern. Imaging studies showed pleuropericardial effusion, hepatosplenomegaly and polysynovitis. Additional blood tests revealed hypocomplementemia and positive ANA, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies. Haemophagocytosis was not identified either on bone marrow or axillary lymph node biopsy specimens. However, SLE-associated MAS seemed to fit this set-up. High-dose corticotherapy (6.5 g methylprednisolone followed by prednisone, 1.5 mg/kg/day after discharge) and intravenous cyclophosphamide were necessary to induce and sustain remission.CONCLUSION: MAS is a potentially severe manifestation that should be considered at SLE onset whenever high fever and elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin and procalcitonin are noted. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment lead to remission in two thirds of cases. Glucocorticoid-resistance leads to the use of high-dose corticotherapy or immunosuppressive agents that could elicit serious side effects. New insights into the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid-resistance are needed in order to conceive more adequate GC-therapies."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"During infectious processes, the production of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), gamma interferon (IFNγ) and chemokines orchestrates the anti-infectious innate immune response.

However, an overzealous production, leading up to a cytokine storm, can be deleterious and contributes to mortality consecutive to sepsis or toxic shock syndrome.

LPS and numerous pore-forming exotoxins also activate the inflammasome, the molecular platform that allows the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Among exotoxins, some behave as superantigens, and as such activate the release of cytokines by T-lymphocytes. In most cases, pre-exposure to exotoxins enhances the cytokine production induced by LPS and its lethality, whereas pre-exposure to endotoxin usually results in tolerance.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are signaling molecules responsible for the production of cytokines and chemokines that can mediate hyperactivation of the immune response called cytokine storm. In addition to the above-mentioned agents, various antioxidants have been explored for the removal of excess ROS during inflammation.

A monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A showed a positive effect in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS, and a humanised form of this antibody (ozanezumab) was well tolerated in a first-in-human trial. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ozanezumab in patients with ALS.METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was done in 34 centres in 11 countries. Patients aged 18-80 years with a diagnosis of familial or sporadic ALS were randomly assigned (1:1), centrally according to a computer-generated allocation schedule, to receive ozanezumab (15 mg/kg) or placebo as intravenous infusions over 1 h every 2 weeks for 46 weeks, followed by assessments at week 48 and week 60. Patients and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was a joint-rank analysis of function (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised) and overall survival, analysed at 48 weeks in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01753076, and with GSK-ClinicalStudyRegister.com, NOG112264, and is completed.FINDINGS: Between Dec 20, 2012, and Nov 1, 2013, we recruited 307 patients, of whom 303 were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=151) or ozanezumab (n=152). The adjusted mean of the joint-rank score was -14·9 (SE 13·5) for the ozanezumab group and 15·0 (13·6) for the placebo group, with a least squares mean difference of -30·0 (95% CI -67·9 to 7·9; p=0·12). Overall, reported adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study were similar between the treatment groups, except for dyspepsia (ten [7%] in the ozanezumab group vs four [3%] in the placebo group), depression (11 [7%] vs five [3%]), and diarrhoea (25 [16%] vs 12 [8%]). Respiratory failure was the most common serious adverse event (12 [8%] vs seven [5%]). At week 60, the number of deaths was higher in the ozanezumab group (20 [13%]) than in the placebo group (16 [11%]), mainly as a result of respiratory failure (ten [7%] vs five [3%]). Two deaths were considered related to the study drug (bladder transitional cell carcinoma in the ozanezumab group and cerebrovascular accident in the placebo group).INTERPRETATION: Ozanezumab did not show efficacy compared with placebo in patients with ALS.

Crocin inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide production via downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B activity in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. These effects were abrogated by blocking of HO-1 expression or activity. Crocin also induced Ca(2+) mobilization from intracellular pools and phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 4 (CAMK4).

In this study, we demonstrate that autophagy is a critical mediator of the viral degradation pathway and that this pathway is not HIV-1 specific. Misassembled viral complexes were found to colocalize extensively with LC3 and p62 in late endosomes/lysosomes, demonstrating a convergence of autophagy with functional degradative compartments. Knocking down autophagosome formation machineries reduced this convergence, while treatment with autophagy-inducer rapamycin enhanced the convergence. Furthermore, similar autophagy-dependent nonspecific miRNA inhibition of murine leukemia virus (MLV) assembly was shown. Overall, these results reveal autophagy as a crucial regulator of the retroviral degradation pathway in host cells initiated by nonspecific miRNA-Gag interactions.

X-inactivation escape of the TLR7 gene was investigated in monoclonal B cell lines and, independently, in pDCs after cell sorting and single-cell picking, indicating regular silencing of one TLR7 allele in females. Additionally, exogenous 17beta-estrogen and estrogen receptor antagonism did not indicate a significant role on TLR7-induced IFN-alpha production. Our data reveal for the first time a profound sex-dependent pathway of TLR7-induced IFN-alpha with higher production in females.

No significant differences were identified between the different pouch designs with regard to anastomotic dehiscence, anastomotic stricture, pelvic sepsis, wound infection, pouch fistula, pouch ischaemia, perioperative haemorrhage, small bowel obstruction, pouchitis and sexual dysfunction. The W and K designs resulted in fewer cases of pouch failure compared with the J and S designs. J pouch construction resulted in a smaller maximum pouch volume compared with W and K pouches. Stool frequency per 24 h and during daytime was higher following a J pouch than W, S or K constructions. The J design resulted in increased faecal urgency and seepage during daytime compared with the K design. The use of protective pads during daytime and night-time was greater with a J pouch compared to S or K. The use of antidiarrhoeal medication was greater after a J reservoir than a W reservoir.

The emergence of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has been considered to be because of the excessive use of antimalarial drugs worldwide. Moreover, the intense distribution and prevalence of chloroquine-resistant strains in endemic regions has aided the incidence of more complications to malaria treatment and control. Due to the lack of literature that portrays evident molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, it has been difficult to understand the drug resistance conferred by Plasmodium species. Intensive research on CQ drug resistance has identified the association of P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter protein (PfCRT), which belongs to the drug/metabolite transporter and EamA-like superfamily. Additionally, it has shown that K76 T mutation in PfCRT protein has mainly attributed to CQ resistance than other mutations. This study deals with the development of an in silico model of the PfCRT protein and its interaction with the CQ ligand molecule as well as the biochemical and biophysical characterization of the transmembrane domain 1 (TMD 1) peptide of the PfCRT protein. The physiochemical analysis of the PfCRT protein identified basic differences between the wild and mutant forms of the protein, as well as identifying the high hydrophobic nature of the mutant-type protein. The tertiary structure of the PfCRT protein was predicted and interaction with CQ revealed different active pocket binding regions in both the wild and mutant form of PfCRT proteins. The CQ2+ molecule interacts with TMD 10 of the wild-type PfCRT protein, whereas it interacts with TMD 1 of the mutant-type protein. Studies on the TMD 1 peptide revealed the insertion of the peptide in the micelles adopting stable alpha-helical structure. Binding studies with the CQ molecule detected high binding affinity toward the mutant-type TMD 1 peptide rather than the wild-type, thus confirming that the TMD 1 peptide is involved in substrate selectivity. Our findings help to characterize the structure of the PfCRT protein and the role played by the TMD 1 region in CQ resistance using in silico and biochemical approaches. Molecular docking and ligand binding studies confirm that TMD 1 is involved in substrate selectivity and aids in CQ efflux, thereby contributing to the parasite's CQ drug resistance mechanism."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Historically chloroquine was used to treat the most deadly form of malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum.

A PfCRT structure would provide new insights into how the protein confers chloroquine resistance and thereby also yield novel opportunities for developing anti-malarial therapies. Although PfCRT is an attractive target for characterisation and structure determination, very little work has been published on its expression and purification. Here we present a medium throughput protocol, employing Sf9 insect cells, for testing the expression, stability and purification yield of rationally designed PfCRT mutant constructs and constructs of a PfCRT orthologue from Neospora caninum (NcCRT). We have identified a conserved cysteine residue in PfCRT that results in elevated protein stability when mutated. Combining this mutation with the insertion of T4-lysozyme into a specific surface loop further augments PfCRT protein yield and thermostability.

Antagonizing HMGB1 prolongs muscle necrosis and deters regeneration. In this study, we evaluated HMGB1 expression in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and the mechanisms that promote its release in a murine model of hindlimb ischemia. Specifically, we investigated how chloroquine (CQ), a commonly employed disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, promotes HMGB1 release from muscle. We hypothesized that CQ could increase HMGB1 locally and systemically, allowing it to mediate recovery from ischemic injury.METHODS: Muscle biopsies were performed on patients undergoing lower extremity surgery for non-PAD-related disease as well as for claudication and critical limb ischemia. Clinical symptoms and ankle-brachial indices were recorded for each patient. HMGB1 was detected in muscle sections using immunohistochemical staining. Unilateral femoral artery ligation was performed on both wild-type and inducible HMGB1 knockout mice. Wild-type mice were administered intraperitoneal CQ 2 weeks before and after femoral artery ligation. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging was used to determine perfusion recovery. Serum and tissue levels of HMGB1 were measured at designated time points. In vitro, cultured C2C12 myoblasts were treated with increasing doses of CQ. HMGB1, autophagosome formation, p62/SQSTM1 accumulation, caspase-1 expression and activity, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were measured in supernatants and cell lysates.RESULTS: Nuclear expression of HMGB1 was prominent in patients with claudication and critical limb ischemia (P < .05) compared with controls. CQ-treated mice had elevated serum HMGB1 and diffuse HMGB1 staining in muscle (P < .01). In wild-type mice, CQ treatment resulted in higher laser Doppler perfusion imaging ratios in the ischemic limb at 7 days (P < .03) and less fat replacement after 2 weeks (P < .03). In cultured myoblasts, CQ induced autophagosome accumulation, inhibited p62/SQSTM-1 degradation, and activated caspase-1.CONCLUSIONS: HMGB1 is prominently expressed in PAD muscle but mostly confined to the nucleus. Our in vivo data suggest that HMGB1 mobilization into the sarcoplasm and serum can be increased with CQ, possibly through caspase-1-mediated pathways. Whereas HMGB1 can be released by many cell types, these studies suggest that the muscle may be an important additional source that is relevant in PAD.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

It is also licensed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Studies of HCQ-treated patients with SLE or RA have demonstrated a positive correlation between whole-blood HCQ levels and clinical response. Such studies have involved measuring whole-blood concentrations at any given time point after HCQ ingestion assuming that steady-state concentrations would undergo limited fluctuation over a daily interval because HCQ has a long half-life. This approach might not sufficiently take into account the potential intra-patient variation in HCQ blood levels that can occur over a 24-hour period. Such variation, if significant, could affect the credibility of any concentration-response relationship provided from these previous studies. Objectives The objectives of this report are to: (a) investigate the intra-patient variation in HCQ whole-blood levels and (b) suggest an optimum time for sampling patients for future studies. Methods Six patients were recruited with cutaneous lupus erythematosus who had each been on HCQ 200 mg twice daily for at least six months, so that they were at steady-state. Each patient was fasted overnight and had standardized meals and dosing schedule. Whole blood was sampled at seven time points over 24 hours. Whole-blood HCQ levels were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography using gradient elution, fluorimetric detection and chloroquine as an internal standard. The assay had a mean inter- and intra-day coefficient of variation of 10% and 5% respectively and a limit of detection of 5ng/ml. Results HCQ levels appeared to follow a biphasic pattern over the sampling period. Maximum levels were noted a median of four hours (range 2-6) after ingestion. Median intra-patient variation between trough and peak levels, 'Cmax' ((peak - trough)/trough × 100%), was 27% (range 8-150%). Conclusions This study demonstrated that whole-blood HCQ levels vary 27% (median, range 8-150%) within an individual over a 12-hour period. Drug levels might differ between individuals because of multiple factors, including variable adherence to medication. Measuring HCQ levels for assessment of drug adherence could be valuable in the 'real-world' clinical setting. This could be assessed by taking a blood sample at any time following HCQ ingestion. If patients were found to have very low or undetectable levels of HCQ, non-adherence to HCQ should be suspected."}]},{"title":"summary","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, which act by inhibiting progression from the G1 to S phases of the cell cycle, include palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib, and trilaciclib.

These results uncover new functional properties of natural promoters and suggest the minimization of expression noise as an important factor in promoter evolution."}]},{"title":"list","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Two rotavirus vaccines, RotaTeq and Rotarix, are licensed for global use; however, the protection they confer to unvaccinated individuals through indirect effects remains unknown.

Up to 10% of FCoV infections, however, result in the fatal disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Clinical challenges: Obtaining a definitive diagnosis of FIP based on non-invasive approaches is difficult. Confirmation of the disease relies on finding appropriate cytological or histopathological changes in association with positive immunostaining for FCoV antigen. In FIP cases with effusions, cytology and immunostaining on effusion samples can be relatively easy to perform; otherwise obtaining diagnostic samples is more challenging and collection of biopsies from tissues with gross lesions is necessary. In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, a high index of suspicion of FIP may be obtained from the cat's signalment and history, combined with findings on clinical examination and laboratory test results. If largely consistent with FIP, these can be used as a basis for discussion with the owner about whether additional, more invasive, diagnostic tests are warranted. In some cases it may be that euthanasia is discussed as an alternative to pursuing a definitive diagnosis ante-mortem, especially if financial limitations exist or where there are concerns over a cat's ability to tolerate invasive diagnostic procedures. Ideally, the diagnosis should be confirmed in such patients from samples taken at post-mortem examination.

Changes in the levels of ACE2 have been observed in a number of pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, but little is known of the mechanisms regulating its expression. In the present study, therefore, the potential role of miRNAs in the regulation of ACE2 expression in primary human cardiac myofibroblasts was examined. Putative miRNA-binding sites were identified in the 3'-UTR of the ACE2 transcript using online prediction algorithms. Two of these, miR-200b and miR-421, were selected for further analysis. A reporter system using the 3'-UTR of ACE2 fused to the coding region of firefly luciferase was used to determine the functionality of the identified binding sites in vitro. This identified miR-421, but not miR-200b, as a potential regulator of ACE2. The ability of miR-421, an miRNA implicated in the development of thrombosis, to down-regulate ACE2 expression was subsequently confirmed by Western blot analysis of both primary cardiac myofibroblasts and transformed cells transfected with a synthetic miR-421 precursor. Real-time PCR analysis of miR-421 revealed widespread expression in human tissues. miR-421 levels in cardiac myofibroblasts showed significant inter-patient variability, in keeping with the variability of ACE2 expression we have observed previously. In conclusion, the present study is the first to demonstrate that ACE2 may be subject to post-transcriptional regulation and reveals a novel potential therapeutic target, miR-421, which could be exploited to modulate ACE2 expression in disease."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"ACE2 has been identified in various tissues and is supposed to be a modulator of cardiovascular function.

We assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the GRADE approach. We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures. We reported findings narratively and in tables.MAIN RESULTS: We included nine Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions to treat symptoms in people with MND. Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non-RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. Drug therapy for painThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. Treatment for crampsThere is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo:- memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence);- vitamin E may have little or no effect (low-quality evidence); and- the effects of L-threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data.The review reported adverse effects of riluzole, but it is not clear whether other interventions had adverse effects. Treatment for spasticityIt is uncertain whether an endurance-based exercise programme improved spasticity or quality of life, measured at three months after the programme, as the quality of evidence is very low (1 RCT, comparison \"usual activities\", N = 25). The review did not evaluate other approaches, such as use of baclofen as no RCTs were available. Mechanical ventilation for supporting respiratory functionNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves median survival and quality of life in people with respiratory insufficiency and normal to moderately impaired bulbar function compared to standard care, and improves quality of life but not survival for people with poor bulbar function (1 RCT, N = 41, moderate-quality evidence; a second RCT did not provide data). The review did not evaluate other approaches such as tracheostomy-assisted ('invasive') ventilation, or assess timing of NIV initiation. Treatment for sialorrhoeaA single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands probably improves sialorrhoea and quality of life at up to 4 weeks compared to placebo injections, but not at 8 or 12 weeks after the injections (moderate-quality evidence from 1 placebo-controlled RCT, N = 20). The review authors found no trials of other approaches. Enteral tube feeding for supporting nutritionThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to support benefit or harms of enteral tube feeding in supporting nutrition in MND. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulationIt is uncertain whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves disability or limitation in activity in MND in comparison with sham rTMS (3 RCTs, very low quality evidence, N = 50). Therapeutic exerciseThere is evidence that exercise may improve disability in MND at three months after the exercise programme, but not quality of life, in comparison with \"usual activities\" or \"usual care\" including stretching (2 RCTs, low-quality evidence, N = 43). Multidisciplinary careThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to demonstrate any benefit or harm for multidisciplinary care in MND.None of the reviews, other than the review of treatment for cramps, reported that adverse events occurred. However, the trials were too small for reliable adverse event reporting.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview has highlighted the lack of robust evidence in Cochrane Systematic Reviews on interventions to manage symptoms resulting from MND. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention for reasons other than a true lack of efficacy, for example because of insufficient statistical power, the wrong choice of dose, insensitive outcome measures or inappropriate participant eligibility. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse effects of the treatments. The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a placebo-controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo-controlled RCTs in these areas.We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs-of people with MND and their caregivers-associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality of life)."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L-threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine.

Hemispheric rCBF was unchanged in spontaneous migraine attacks without aura. This was true for the headache side as well as for the nonheadache side. Sumatriptan had no effects on cerebral blood flow. Regional cerebral blood flow was increased in midline brain stem structures during the headache phase, but also when the headache had been treated with sumatriptan.

Thus, specific inhibitors of these proteases block virus infection. However, it is unclear which of these pathways is actually utilized by HCoV-229E in the human respiratory tract. Here, we examined the mechanism of cell entry used by a pseudotyped virus bearing the HCoV-229E spike (S) protein in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. We found that, compared with a laboratory strain isolated in 1966 and passaged for a half century, clinical isolates of HCoV-229E were less likely to utilize cathepsin L; rather, they showed a preference for TMPRSS2. Two amino acid substitutions (R642M and N714K) in the S protein of HCoV-229E clinical isolates altered their sensitivity to a cathepsin L inhibitor, suggesting that these amino acids were responsible for cathepsin L use. After 20 passages in HeLa cells, the ability of the isolate to use cathepsin increased so that it was equal to that of the laboratory strain; this increase was caused by an amino acid substitution (I577S) in the S protein. The passaged virus showed a reduced ability to replicate in differentiated airway epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface. These results suggest that the endosomal pathway is disadvantageous for HCoV-229E infection of human airway epithelial cells; therefore, clinical isolates are less able to use cathepsin.IMPORTANCE: Many enveloped viruses enter cells through endocytosis. Viral spike proteins drive the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes to facilitate insertion of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) utilizes endosomal cathepsin L to activate the spike protein after receptor binding. Here, we found that clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferentially utilize the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin L. The endosome is a main site of Toll-like receptor recognition, which then triggers an innate immune response; therefore, HCoV-229E presumably evolved to bypass the endosome by entering the cell via TMPRSS2. Thus, the virus uses a simple mechanism to evade the host innate immune system. Therefore, therapeutic agents for coronavirus-mediated diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), should target cell surface TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Microbiology."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting investigations revealed the presence of cathepsin L in the nuclear compartment in addition to its expected endo-lysosomal localization in colorectal carcinoma cells.","answer_start":363}],"question":"Is cathepsin L active in endosomes?","id":"5e8101e3835f4e477700002e_003","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Prominent tasks of cysteine cathepsins involve endo-lysosomal proteolysis and turnover of extracellular matrix constituents or plasma membrane proteins for maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.

Cathepsin L was represented as the full-length protein in the nuclei of HCT116 cells from which stefin B, a potent cathepsin L inhibitor, was absent. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analyses with synchronized cell cultures revealed deceleration of cell cycle progression of HCT116 cells upon inhibition of cathepsin L activity, while expression of cathepsin L-enhanced green fluorescent protein chimeras accelerated S-phase entry. We conclude that the activity of cathepsin L is high in the nucleus of colorectal carcinoma cells because of lacking stefin B inhibitory activity.

Peanut allergies are also on the rise and often do not spontaneously resolve, leaving individuals at-risk for potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis throughout their lifetime. Currently, two forms of peanut immunotherapy, oral immunotherapy (OIT) and epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT), are in Phase III clinical trials and have shown promise to induce desensitization in many subjects. However, there are several limitations with OIT and EPIT, such as allergic side effects, daily dosing requirements, and the infrequent outcome of long-term tolerance. Next-generation therapies for peanut allergy should aim to overcome these limitations, which may be achievable with adjuvanted immunotherapy. An adjuvant can be defined as anything that enhances, accelerates, or modifies an immune response to a particular antigen. Adjuvants may allow for lower doses of antigen to be given leading to decreased side effects; may only need to be administered every few weeks or months rather than daily exposures; and may induce a long-lasting protective effect. In this review article, we highlight examples of adjuvants and formulations that have shown pre-clinical efficacy in treating peanut allergy."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"This article presents an overview of potential treatments of food allergy, with an emphasis on various forms of immunotherapy (including oral immunotherapy, sublingual immunotherapy, epicutaneous immunotherapy, immunotherapy with modified food antigens, and immunotherapy with a recombinant peanut vaccine).","answer_start":0}],"question":"Is there a vaccine for peanut allergy?","id":"5e46bdcd3f54159529000007_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"This article presents an overview of potential treatments of food allergy, with an emphasis on various forms of immunotherapy (including oral immunotherapy, sublingual immunotherapy, epicutaneous immunotherapy, immunotherapy with modified food antigens, and immunotherapy with a recombinant peanut vaccine).

The different subpopulations of vesicles can be differentiated by size and origin, in which exosomes (~100 nm and from endocytic origin) are the most studied so far. EVs have essential roles in cell-to-cell communication and are critical modulators of immune response under normal and pathological conditions. Pregnancy is a unique situation of immune-modulation in which the maternal immune system protects the fetus from allogenic rejection and maintains the immunosurveillance. The placenta is a vital organ that performs a multitude of functions to support the pregnancy. The EVs derived from the human placenta have crucial roles in regulating the maternal immune response for successful pregnancy outcome. Placenta-derived vesicles perform a myriad of functions like suppression of immune reaction to the developing fetus and establishment and maintenance of a systemic inflammatory response to combat infectious intruders. A fine-tuning of these mechanisms is quintessential for successful completion of pregnancy and healthy outcome for mother and fetus. Dysregulation in the mechanisms mentioned above can lead to several pregnancy disorders. In this review, we summarize the current literature regarding the critical roles played by the EVs in immunomodulation during pregnancy with particular attention to the placenta-derived exosomes."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), microparticles, exosomes, and apoptotic bodies, originated by different cell types are emerging as a novel mean of cell-to-cell communication in physiology and pathology and represent a new way to convey fundamental information between cells.

Three types of strategies can be used: (i) plants are able to produce EVs that encapsulate natural components from vegetables, polyphenols for instance, (ii) mammalian cells can be treated with polyphenols and the subsequent EVs produced are enriched in these components, and (iii) EVs from mammalian cells can be uploaded with polyphenols.

These vesicles include exosomes, ectosomes (ie, microparticles, extracellular vesicles, microvesicles, and shedding vesicles), and apoptotic bodies. Exosomes are generated by inward budding of the membrane (endocytosis), subsequent forming of multivesicular bodies, and release by exocytosis. Ectosomes are formed by outward blebbing from the plasma membrane and are then released by proteolytic cleavage from the cell surface. Apoptotic bodies are generated on apoptotic cell shrinkage and death. Extracellular vesicles are released when the cells are activated or undergo apoptosis under inflammatory conditions. The number and types of released EVs are different according to the pathophysiological status of the disease. Therefore, EVs can be novel biomarkers for various lung diseases. EVs contain several molecules, including proteins, mRNA, microRNA, and DNA; they transfer these molecules to distant recipient cells. Circulating EVs modify the targeted cells and influence the microenvironment of the lungs.

U. fasciata extract was reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against cancer. In the present study, we have studied the anticancer potential of the compound, guai-2-en-10α-ol, from U. fasciata. The compound showed selective cytotoxicity toward triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line (MDA MB-231) in a dose-dependent manner. In treated cells, the apoptotic hallmarks such as formation of apoptotic bodies, cell shrinkage, and nuclear condensation were observed. Many small molecules affect the function of cellular signaling pathways. As EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway proteins are frequently altered in TNBC, we have studied the gene expression of key proteins of this pathway. The semiquantitative PCR results demonstrated the down-regulated expression of PDPK1 (positive regulator) and Akt (key activator) as well as up-regulated expression of PTEN (negative regulator), which suggested the interaction of guai-2-en-10α-ol with upstream protein. Further investigation showed the down-regulation of both PI3K and EGFR. As EGFR is the most upstream protein of the pathway, its protein level expression was investigated. Western blotting analysis confirmed the down-regulation of p-EGFR expression and activation of apoptosis upon compound treatment. Cell cycle analysis also evidenced the G1 phase arrest, which can be due to the inhibition of cell survival pathway. Computational studies showed the interaction of guai-2-en-10α-ol with Asp855 residue of EGFR kinase domain in active conformation.

Furthermore, they may contribute to the pathophysiology of renal disease while also having beneficial effects associated with tissue repair.

Replication was sought in 1311-21860 subjects from 20 independent cohorts. A significant association was observed in the discovery cohorts for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17518584 (discovery P-value=3.12 × 10(-8)) and in the joint discovery and replication meta-analysis (P-value=3.28 × 10(-9) after adjustment for age, gender and education) in an intron of the gene cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) for performance on the LDST/DSST. Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. The variant is associated with expression of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value=4 × 10(-4)). The protein encoded by CADM2 is involved in glutamate signaling (P-value=7.22 × 10(-15)), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value=1.36 × 10(-11)) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value=1.48 × 10(-13)). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in the CADM2 gene is associated with individual differences in information processing speed."}]},{"title":"list","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Despite discontinuation of the first inhalable insulin, Exubera®, due to suboptimal market acceptance, development of orally inhaled insulin delivery systems has been galvanized by the recent approval of Afrezza® and several others awaiting approval.","answer_start":196}],"question":"Name two inhalable insulin products.","id":"5e7768f9835f4e477700000b_001","is_impossible":false}],"context":"INTRODUCTION: Delivery of therapeutic insulin via the pulmonary route has been the most investigated non-invasive alternative to the commonly used subcutaneous (SC) route for diabetes management.

We have since found decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha, as well as caspase-3 mRNA expression, as possible mechanisms of action for minocycline's ameliorative action. These results support reports that modulating apoptosis, caspases, and microglia provide promising therapeutic targets for prevention and/or limiting the degree of functional loss after CNS trauma.

As on previous occasions, the results obtained in the laboratory are not reproduced in clinical practice. The reasons for this new disappointment in translational medicine are analysed by applying the successes obtained in the experimental animal model for ALS to humans. The most frequently suggested causes for explaining these continuous failures are unawareness of the correct dosage to be used, the ideal duration of the clinical trial in phase III, sample size, the search for a primary outcome for measurement other than survival, the need for biomarkers giving information on the progression of the disease and whether this is modified by the introduction of the drug for study. Debate focuses on whether the transgenic mouse model of ALS which expresses SOD1 mutations which we have been using for more than a decade is an exact reflection of the clinical profile and the physiopathogenic mechanisms present in patients with spo- radic ALS. There is the possibility that depending on the dose administered, minocycline can be a neuroprotector or a neurotoxin. In other words, at a dose of 200 mg/day, this drug behaves like <<Dr. Jekyll>> and like <<Mr. Hyde>> at doses of 400 mg. For the authors of the trial, this possibility does not seem to be the cause of the disappointing results obtained. However, they acknowledge that one of the limitations of their study was that it was impossible to compare the effects of minocycline in the patient after receiving 200 or 400 mg. For many other researchers running ongoing clinical trials in both ALS and other neurological diseases, the dose of 200 mg/day is chosen as ideal for testing the effectiveness of minocycline in patients. The strategy of administering the maximum dose of a drug to be tested may give rise to misleading results. We agree with the opinion of other authors, who say that minocycline should be given a second chance."}]},{"title":"summary","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"In vitro, the three known yeast nucleosome spacing enzymes (CHD1, ISW1 and ISW2) form arrays with different spacing.","answer_start":294}],"question":"What is the function of the ISW1 and CHD1 remodellers in yeast chromatin?","id":"5d3880eea1e1595105000014_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"Adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling machines play a central role in gene regulation by manipulating chromatin structure.

The goal of this study was to identify morphological changes in melanized and non-melanized CN cells following irradiation with densely-ionizing deuterons and alpha particles relative to sparsely-ionizing gamma radiation. We observed significant differences between the melanized and non-melanized CN cellular ultrastructure following irradiation. Melanized CN cells were relatively resistant to mid and max-dose levels of alpha particles and deuterons irradiation. Following irradiation the capsule was stripped, but the cell wall was intact and structural integrity was maintained. At the maximum dose, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and mitochondrial swelling started to occur. In contrast, the non-melanized CN strain was sensitive to the mid-dose radiation. Non-melanized cells presented two morphologies: small condensed, and swollen, lacking structural integrity.

Despite its beneficial therapeutic effects on tumor cells, exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) is associated with several side effects. Although improvements in radiotherapy techniques and instruments could reduce these side effects, there are still important concerns for cancer patients. For several years, scientists have been trying to modulate tumor and normal tissue responses to IR, leading to an increase in therapeutic ratio. So far, several types of radioprotectors and radiosensitizers have been investigated in experimental studies. However, high toxicity of chemical sensitizers or possible tumor protection by radioprotectors creates a doubt for their clinical applications. On the other hand, the protective effects of these radioprotectors or sensitizer effects of radiosensitizers may limit some type of cancers. Hence, the development of some radioprotectors without any protective effect on tumor cells or low toxic radiosensitizers can help improve therapeutic ratio with less side effects. Melatonin as a natural body hormone is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that shows some anti-cancer properties. It is able to neutralize different types of free radicals produced by IR or pro-oxidant enzymes which are activated following exposure to IR and plays a key role in the protection of normal tissues. In addition, melatonin has shown the ability to inhibit long-term changes in inflammatory responses at different levels, thereby ameliorating late side effects of radiotherapy. Fortunately, in contrast to classic antioxidants, some in vitro studies have revealed that melatonin has a potent anti-tumor activity when used alongside irradiation. However, the mechanisms of its radiosensitive effect remain to be elucidated. Studies suggested that the activation of pro-apoptosis gene, such as p53, changes in the metabolism of tumor cells, suppression of DNA repair responses as well as changes in biosynthesis of estrogen in breast cancer cells are involved in this process. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanisms for radioprotection and radiosensitizer effects of melatonin.

Encapsulated TPs nanoparticles were spherical in size and promoted TPs stability in normal and gastrointestinal conditions without losing antioxidant activity.

However, radiation-induced damage to normal tissues restricts the therapeutic doses of radiation that can be delivered to tumours and thereby limits the effectiveness of the treatment. The use of radioprotectors represents an obvious strategy to obtain better tumour control using a higher dose in radiotherapy. However, most of the synthetic radioprotective compounds studied have shown inadequate clinical efficacy owing to their inherent toxicity and high cost. Hence, the development of radioprotective agents with lower toxicity and an extended window of protection has attracted a great deal of attention, and the identification of alternative agents that are less toxic and highly effective is an absolute necessity. Recent studies have shown that alpha-2-macroglobulin (α2M) possesses radioprotective effects. α2M is a tetrameric, disulfide-rich plasma glycoprotein that functions as a non-selective inhibitor of different types of non-specific proteases and as a carrier of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. α2M induces protein factors whose interplay underlies radioprotection, which supports the idea that α2M is the central effector of natural radioprotection in the rat. Pretreatment with α2M has also induced a significant reduction of irradiation-induced DNA damage and the complete restoration of liver and body weight. Mihailović et al. concluded that the radioprotection provided by α2M was in part mediated through cytoprotection of new blood cells produced in the bone marrow; these authors also indicated that an important aspect of the radioprotective effect of amifostine was the result of the induction of the endogenous cytoprotective capability of α2M. The radioprotective effects of α2M are possibly due to antioxidant, anti-fibrosis, and anti-inflammatory functions, as well as the maintenance of homeostasis, and enhancement of the DNA repair and cell recovery processes. This review is the first to summarise the observations and elucidate the possible mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of α2M.

The African and Asian elephant genomes were analyzed for potential mechanisms of cancer resistance. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from elephants, healthy human controls, and patients with LFS were tested in vitro in the laboratory for DNA damage response.

Human samples were collected at the University of Utah between June 2014 and July 2015.EXPOSURES: Ionizing radiation and doxorubicin.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cancer mortality across species was calculated and compared by body size and life span. The elephant genome was investigated for alterations in cancer-related genes. DNA repair and apoptosis were compared in elephant vs human peripheral blood lymphocytes.RESULTS: Across mammals, cancer mortality did not increase with body size and/or maximum life span (eg, for rock hyrax, 1% [95% CI, 0%-5%]; African wild dog, 8% [95% CI, 0%-16%]; lion, 2% [95% CI, 0%-7%]).

Finding treatments to delay or prevent the courses of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is an unmet and essential goal of the research in multiple sclerosis. In this review, we discuss new findings regarding drugs with immunomodulatory, neuroprotective or regenerative properties and possible treatment strategies for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. We examine the field broadly to include trials where participants have progressive or relapsing phenotypes. We summarise the most relevant results from newer investigations from phase II and III randomised controlled trials over the past decade, with particular attention to the last 5 years."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":" relapsing-remitting MS, primary and secondary progressive MS) ","answer_start":403}],"question":"List the stages/types of Multiple Sclerosis.","id":"5e52c5166d0a27794100004d_003","is_impossible":false}],"context":"OBJECTIVE: To perform systematic transcriptomic analysis of multiple sclerosis (MS) risk genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of subjects with distinct MS stages and describe the pathways characterized by dysregulated gene expressions.METHODS: We monitored gene expression levels in PBMCs from 3 independent cohorts for a total of 297 cases (including clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS, primary and secondary progressive MS) and 96 healthy controls by distinct microarray platforms and quantitative PCR. Differential expression and pathway analyses for distinct MS stages were defined and validated by literature mining.RESULTS: Genes located in the vicinity of MS risk variants displayed altered expression in peripheral blood at distinct stages of MS compared with the healthy population. The frequency of dysregulation was significantly higher than expected in CIS and progressive forms of MS.

Available smoking cessation tools include pharmacotherapies that act in the CNS and show modest long-term efficacy. Additionally, there are emerging concerns that they may cause adverse neuropsychiatric events. Antinicotine vaccines have been used experimentally as aids to smoking cessation. It is hypothesized that antibody capture of nicotine in the bloodstream would prevent it from crossing the blood-brain barrier and reaching the nicotinic receptors. The advantage of the approach includes the relatively gradual rise of antibody levels, which may reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and the possible persistence of the antibodies potentially provides long-term protection, possibly preventing relapse. Proof-of-concept studies of at least two vaccine candidates have shown correlations between antinicotine antibody exposure and smoking abstinence. Unfortunately, the only vaccine tested in two large, randomized Phase III trials, 3'-amino-methyl-nicotine r-exoprotein A conjugate vaccine (NicVAX(®), Nabi Biopharmaceuticals, MD, USA), did not demonstrate efficacy.

We have used the risk ratio (RR) to summarize individual trial outcomes. We have not pooled the current group of included studies as they cover different vaccines and variable regimens.MAIN RESULTS: There are no nicotine vaccines currently licensed for public use, but there are a number in development. We found four trials which met our inclusion criteria, three comparing NicVAX to placebo and one comparing NIC002 (formerly NicQbeta) to placebo. All were smoking cessation trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies as part of the drug development process, and all trials were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Overall, 2642 smokers participated in the included studies in this review. None of the four included studies detected a statistically significant difference in long-term cessation between participants receiving vaccine and those receiving placebo. The RR for 12 month cessation in active and placebo groups was 1.35 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.82 to 2.22) in the trial of NIC002 and 1.74 (95% CI 0.73 to 4.18) in one NicVAX trial. Two Phase III NicVAX trials, for which full results were not available, reported similar quit rates of approximately 11% in both groups. In the two studies with full results available, post hoc analyses detected higher cessation rates in participants with higher levels of nicotine antibodies, but these findings are not readily generalisable. The two studies with full results showed nicotine vaccines to be well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. In the study of NIC002, participants receiving the vaccine were more likely to report mild to moderate adverse events, most commonly flu-like symptoms, whereas in the study of NicVAX there was no significant difference between the two arms.

The evidence available suggests nicotine vaccines do not induce compensatory smoking or affect withdrawal symptoms.

Current smoking cessation rates using behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapeutic interventions have had modest success, with ∼1:5 smokers remaining abstinent long-term. Nicotine vaccines are a new class of immunotherapeutics under development. It is believed that anti-nicotine antibodies arising from vaccination capture nicotine and prevent or reduce its entry into the brain, as the antibody-bound nicotine is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier. This in turn decreases the pleasurable effects of smoking, reducing or eliminating positive reinforcement, thereby making it easier for a smoker to quit smoking. Four vaccine candidates have advanced into clinical testing with mixed success. Proof-of-concept has been established in that individuals with higher levels of anti-nicotine antibodies were observed to have higher smoking cessation and abstinence rates. Recently, the most advanced candidate vaccine, NicVAX, failed to meet the primary endpoint in two large phase III studies, although the correlation of higher abstinence rates in subjects with higher immunity to nicotine was observed. Although the field has had setbacks, the magnitude of the tobacco epidemic and the positive pre-clinical research and observed clinical trends indicate continued research is warranted. Several avenues are being actively pursued: a) improving vaccine potency by introducing novel carriers and/or adjuvants to stimulate higher immune response b) targeting subjects who have a robust response (e.g. personalized medicine) c) combining vaccines with pharmacotherapy for maintenance of abstinence/relapse prevention.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00318383 NCT00598325 NCT00836199."}]},{"title":"factoid","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Recently, Deep Learning has had an impact in many research areas by achieving new state-of-the-art model performance.

Based on our review of the data, there is little evidence to support the indiscriminate exclusion of AhR activators/Cyp1a1 inducers from early drug developmental pipelines. We also found no evidence that short-term treatment with RMAhRLs produce \"dioxin-like toxicity\" and, in fact, were well tolerated. However, safety testing of individual RMAhRLs under therapeutic conditions, as performed with all promising new drugs, will be needed to reveal whether or not chronic activation of AhR leads to unacceptable adverse outcomes."}]},{"title":"yesno","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"A phase III study failed for carboplatin, paclitaxel, with or without figitumumab in first-line treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","answer_start":119}],"question":"Is Figitumumab effective for non-small cell lung cancer?","id":"5e4b64126d0a277941000028_001","is_impossible":false}],"context":"The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a central component of lung cancer signal transduction pathways. A phase III study failed for carboplatin, paclitaxel, with or without figitumumab in first-line treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There is an urgent need for a better understanding of signaling in IGF system. Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) function as modulators for IGF signaling through sequestration of IGFs in serum and the extracellular fluid. IGFBPs can also act as transporters or modulators for IGF action and insulin action. IGFBPs have attracted increased attention for their lung cancer-related role in recent years. Recent studies have demonstrated the critical role of IGFBPs in risk assessment, early detection, prognosis evaluation, and drug resistance appraisal for lung cancer. These observations suggest a potential new approach to understand the pathogenesis of lung cancer, have important clinical implications, while additional investigations are necessary."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"CONCLUSION: Adding figitumumab to standard chemotherapy failed to increase OS in patients with advanced nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC.","answer_start":1522}],"question":"Is Figitumumab effective for non-small cell lung cancer?","id":"5e4b64126d0a277941000028_002","is_impossible":false}],"context":"PURPOSE: Figitumumab (CP-751,871), a fully human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody, inhibits the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R).

We investigated whether inhibition of the highly homologous insulin receptor (IR) in addition to the IGF1R would be more effective than inhibition of the IGF1R alone at preventing the proliferation of NSCLC cells. Signalling through IGF1R and IR in the NSCLC cell lines A549 and Hcc193 was stimulated by a combination of IGF1, IGF2 and insulin. It was inhibited by antibodies that block ligand binding, αIR3 (IGF1R) and IR47-9 (IR), and by the ATP-competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors AZ12253801 and NVPAWD742 which inhibit both IGF1R and IR tyrosine kinases. The effect of inhibitors was determined by an anchorage-independent proliferation assay and by analysis of Akt phosphorylation. In Hcc193 cells the reduction in cell proliferation and Akt phosphorylation due to anti-IGF1R antibody was enhanced by antibody-mediated inhibition of the IR whereas in A549 cells, with a relatively low IR:IGF1R expression ratio, it was not. In each cell line proliferation and Akt phosphorylation were more effectively inhibited by AZ12253801 and NVPAWD742 than by combined αIR3 and IR47-9. When the IGF1R alone is inhibited, unencumbered signalling through the IR can contribute to continued NSCLC cell proliferation. We conclude that small molecule inhibitors targeting both the IR and IGF1R more effectively reduce NSCLC cell proliferation in a manner independent of the IR:IGF1R expression ratio, providing a therapeutic rationale for the treatment of this disease."},{"qas":[{"answers":[{"text":"Two phase III trials of the anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, figitumumab (CP-751,871), were discontinued in 2010 as it was considered unlikely either trial would meet their primary endpoints.
