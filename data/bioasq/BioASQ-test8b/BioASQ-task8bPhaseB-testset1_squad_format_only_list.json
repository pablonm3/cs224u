Clinical and laboratory information necessary to compute the SLEDAI-2K and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology damage index was collected prospectively and entered onto a computerized database. Patients followed for a minimum of 3 visits, and without absence for a period > 18 consecutive months, were included in the study. Six different approaches to measure variability of SLEDAI-2K were evaluated for each visit, along with AMS. Approaches were the standard deviation, the slope, average rate of change by visit, the range, the coefficient of variation, and the Percentage of the visits with a change in SLEDAI-2K > or = 3. The SLE outcomes under study were death, presence of damage, coronary artery disease (CAD), and osteonecrosis (ON). The predictability of each outcome was evaluated through time-dependent covariate survival analyses. Regression models included other known major risk factors such as sex, age at diagnosis, SLEDAI-2K at presentation, and disease duration.RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-five patients seen from 1970 to 2002 were included. The average time between visits was 4.0 +/- 2.2 months. Eighty-five patients died, 325 developed damage, 55 had CAD, and 68 had ON.

The probability of not having a worsening in SDI score was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.91) and 0.75 (0.67, 0.81) in those without and with baseline damage, respectively (post hoc analysis).Drug-related AEs were reported for 433 (43.4%) patients; infections/infestations (282, 28.3%) and gastrointestinal disorders (139, 13.9%) were the most common.CONCLUSION: Patients with SLE treated with long-term belimumab plus SoC had a low incidence of organ damage accrual and no unexpected AEs. High-risk patients with pre-existing organ damage also had low accrual, suggesting a favorable effect on future damage development.© The Author(s) 2016."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We use piecewise constant intensity models with varying number of pieces, and show how a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method can be used to obtain a posteriori distribution on the intensity of the patterns along the genome.", "answer_start": 256}], "question": "Which methods are used for genome segmentation of gene expression data?", "id": "5c72c9207c78d6947100007b_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The existence of whole genome sequences makes it possible to search for global structure in the genome.

Published evaluation tools, however, allow testing for predefined hypotheses only. Here, we present a novel method for annotation-independent exploration of epigenetic data and their inter-correlation with other genome-wide features. Our method is based on a combinatorial genome segmentation solely using information on combinations of epigenetic marks. It does not require prior knowledge about the data (e.g. gene positions), but allows integrating the data in a straightforward manner. Thereby, it combines compression, clustering and visualization of the data in a single tool. Our method provides intuitive maps of epigenetic patterns across multiple levels of organization, e.g. of the co-occurrence of different epigenetic marks in different cell types. Thus, it facilitates the formulation of new hypotheses on the principles of epigenetic regulation. We apply our method to histone modification data on trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, 9 and 27 in multi-potent and lineage-primed mouse cells, analyzing their combinatorial modification pattern as well as differentiation-related changes of single modifications. We demonstrate that our method is capable of reproducing recent findings of gene centered approaches, e.g. correlations between CpG-density and the analyzed histone modifications. Moreover, combining the clustered epigenetic data with information on the expression status of associated genes we classify differences in epigenetic status of e.g. house-keeping genes versus differentiation-related genes. Visualizing the distribution of modification states on the chromosomes, we discover strong patterns for chromosome X. For example, exclusively H3K9me3 marked segments are enriched, while poised and active states are rare. Hence, our method also provides new insights into chromosome-specific epigenetic patterns, opening up new questions how \"epigenetic computation\" is distributed over the genome in space and time."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Non‑reducing redox western blotting was performed to detect the redox status of intracellular antioxidant proteins, including thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), GSH reductase (GSR), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).

Recent studies suggest that PD-L1 expression in malignant tumors contributes to an immunosuppressive microenvironment and disruption of antitumoral immune response. Drugs targeting this pathway are already tested in clinical trials against several tumor entities with promising results. However, until now comprehensive data with regard to PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is still lacking.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression via immunohistochemistry in two independent cohorts of 293 HNSCC patients.RESULTS: A significant subset of HNSCC showed high expression levels of PD-L1. Most remarkable, we detected a strong correlation between PD-L1 expression and overall survival time in both HNSCC cohorts. Further, in multivariate cox proportional hazard models, PD-L1 dominates as the strongest prognostic factor of patient's outcome in HNSCC, leaving even tumor stage and distant metastasis behind. Moreover, strong PD-L1 expression was associated with the presence of distant metastases in a subset of cases.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, while the significance of PD-L2 in HNSCC seems to minor, we show that PD-L1 expression is common in HNSCC and, more importantly, a both robust and strong prognostic biomarker. In this respect, our results provide hints on further application of therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in HNSCC. Investigation of response and outcome of patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 containing therapies in correlation with PD-L1 expression analysis should be an important task for the future.STATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: In spite of improved treatment options and increasing knowledge of molecular alterations in HNSCC, the survival rate has not been dramatically changed in the past decades. Pies are missing in HNSCC. One promising candidate in cancer immune therapy is PD-L1. Drugs targeting PD-L1 or its receptor PD-1 are subject of several clinical studies in different cancer entities. However, comprehensive data about PD-L1 expression in HNSCC and therefore a rational basis for anti PD-L1/PD-1 therapy in HNSCC is lacking. Here, we provide wide-ranging data about PD-L1 expression in HNSCC of all major localizations. We observed a strong correlation between expression of PD-L1 and reduced overall survival time. Furthermore, high PD-L1 expression was identified as a strong prognostic factor of patient's outcome when verified together with recognized prognostic factors."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Here we demonstrate that PD-L1 is currently the best-known biomarker for G3 NENs, becoming the new gold standard for G3 NEN discrimination.", "answer_start": 1799}], "question": "Which are the problems associated with the use of PD-L1 as immunotherapy biomarker?", "id": "5c7a4a31d774d04240000006_014", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare, heterogeneous and ubiquitous tumors commonly localized in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, and pancreas. The clinical behavior of NEN is highly unpredictable; in fact, low-grade cases can unexpectedly be associated with metastases. Currently, the 2010 WHO NEN classification employs histological differentiation and the proliferation index for grading tumors but fails to provide reliable prognostic and therapeutic indications. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a better characterization of G2/G3 NENs. Similar to several other tumors, NENs possess immune-escape mechanisms, but very little has yet been done to characterize this crucial aspect. There are no available data describing PD-L1 expression in these tumors. Here we provide, for the first time, evidence of PD-L1 tissue expression in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs). PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with a high-grade WHO classification (G3) (P<0.001) but not with gender, primary site, or lymph node status. The PD-L1 positivity rate and signal intensity are directly correlated (P<0.001) with a grade increase from G1 to G3. In particular in G3 cases, we observed a dichotomy between the morphology (WD- and PD-NENs) and Ki67. Moreover, our study demonstrated a significant association with the grade and PD-L1 expression levels in immune-infiltrating cells (P<0.001). In particular, G3 tumors are characterized by strong PD-L1 expression in both the tumor and infiltrating immune cells (P<0.001), reflecting an unfavorable environment for T-cell-mediated tumor aggression. These findings suggest that NENs might acquire resistance to immune surveillance by upregulating PD-L1 and inhibiting peritumoral and intratumoral infiltrating lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate that PD-L1 is currently the best-known biomarker for G3 NENs, becoming the new gold standard for G3 NEN discrimination. Furthermore, pharmacological approaches using anti-PD-1 antibodies may become the logical choice for the treatment of G3 cases with a poor prognosis."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is a validated biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is often also used to select patients for CIT in the context of gastroesophageal cancer, although this marker has not been validated for this purpose.

Despite advances in adjuvant therapies in recent years, the prognosis of these tumors has not improved. In fact, there are currently no consensus guidelines for the treatment of these neoplasms and the search for targetable biomarkers has not been successful so far. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. In normal conditions, PD-L1 is thought to promote immune homeostasis via a number of pathways, but mainly through downregulation of cytotoxic T cells. In some human neoplasms, however, overexpression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been observed, which can modulate the immune system to allow cancer cells to evade host response. As this marker could potentially be a therapeutic target for these tumors, the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in a group of carcinosarcomas was evaluated in the present study.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine cases of gynecologic carcinosarcomas were analyzed, corresponding to tumors originating from the uterus (25), ovary (2), fallopian tube (1), and pelvic epithelium (1). Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 was performed on paraffin sections and the staining results were assessed semiquantitatively in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of each tumor.RESULTS: Positive membranous staining for PD-L1 was detected in 25/29 tumors (86%). The epithelial components were strongly positive in 19/29 (65%) and weakly positive in 6/29 tumors (21%). The mesenchymal elements were strongly positive in 8/29 (27%) and weakly positive in 3/29 tumors (10%). With exception of 1, all tumors with positive sarcomatous components had staining of the carcinomatous element. Four tumors were negative for PD-L1 in both components.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PD-L1 is expressed by the majority of carcinosarcomas, predominantly in the epithelial components. This is particularly important as most locoregional recurrences and distant metastases are of epithelial origin.

One ml of plasma from 12 NSCLC patients, with different mutations and treatments (and 6 healthy donors as controls), were used as exosome sources. After RNAse treatment, in order to degrade circulating miRNAs, the exosomes were isolated with a commercial kit and resuspended in specific buffers for further analysis.

Only 30% of patients presenting with chest pain will have a cardiac origin for the pain, and gastro-oesophageal disorders are one of the common sources of non-cardiac chest pain, yet remain clinically difficult to differentiate from cardiac pain.AIM: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to locate and evaluate clinical trials comparing the use of an oral gastrointestinal (GI) cocktail (oral viscous lidocaine/ antacid ± anticholinergic) to standard diagnostic protocols (serial electrocardiograms (ECGs), serial biomarkers, imaging and/ or provocative testing) to differentiate emergency patients presenting with acute chest pain caused by gastro-oesophageal disease from those with other aetiologies.METHODS: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases, scanning reference lists of articles, and searching clinical trial databases for relevantly currently registered trials. The search included PubMed (1966 - present), Embase (1980 - present) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The identified studies were evaluated with a modified QUADAS tool.RESULTS: A total of four studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Studies were of low methodological quality with heterogeneous results. There were no adequately powered and appropriately designed studies identified.DISCUSSION: Current diagnostic protocols for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) revolve around early and serial ECG monitoring and cardiac biomarker testing, imaging and careful clinical examination. In patients with chest pain and suspected ACS, the use of a GI cocktail compared with standard diagnostic protocols (serial ECG and biomarkers and provocative testing or imaging) is not proven to improve accuracy of diagnosis, and cannot reliably exclude myocardial ischaemia.Crown Copyright © 2014.

Only a few cohorts have been reported. The objective of the present study was to characterize the various spectra of adrenal function in Triple-A patients.METHODS: A retrospective clinical and biological monitoring of 14 patients (10 families) was done in a single multidisciplinary French center. All had AAAS gene sequenced and adrenal function evaluation.RESULTS: Nine different AAAS mutations were found, including one new mutation: c.755G>C, p.(Trp252Ser). Regarding adrenal function, defects of the zona fasciculata and reticularis were demonstrated by increased basal ACTH levels and low DHEAS levels in all cases regardless of the degree of glucocorticoid deficiency. In contrast, mineralocorticoid function was always conserved: i.e., normal plasma renin level associated with normal aldosterone level. The main prognostic feature was exacerbation of neuropathy and cognitive disorders.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in Triple-A patients, adrenal function can be deficient, insufficient or compensated.

Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006 and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was impossible to establish.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of TAS.

However, the clinical picture as well as genetic testing may be complex since symptomatology is variable and mutations cannot be identified in all clinically diagnosed patients. We present two unrelated patients with triple-A syndrome illustrating the importance of alacrima as an early clinical sign.CASE PRESENTATION: A 3.5 year old girl presented with repeated hypoglycaemic myoclonic events. Adrenal insufficiency was diagnosed. In addition, alacrima, obvious since early infancy, was incidentally reported by the mother and finally lead to the clinical diagnosis of triple A syndrome. This was confirmed by positive mutation analysis of the AAAS gene. The second patient, an 8 months old boy was presented because of anisocoria and unilateral optic atrophy. MRI revealed cerebellar vermis hypotrophy. Psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, and frequent vomiting lead to further diagnostic work-up. Achalasia was diagnosed radiologically. In addition, the mother mentioned absence of tears since birth leading to the clinical diagnosis of triple A syndrome. In contrast to the first cases genetic testing was negative.CONCLUSION: These two patients illustrate the heterogeneity of triple A syndrome in both terms, clinical expression and genetic testing. We particularly aim to stress the importance of alacrima, which should be considered as a red flag symptom.

It occurs due to biallelic mutations in the AAAS gene which codes for the nuclear pore protein ALADIN. A number of other features have been reported over time in this heterogeneous and multisystemic disorder. Unlike other autosomal recessive disorders, triple A syndrome patients show a wide phenotypic variability both among different patients and family members harboring the same mutation(s). A gene-environment interaction has been thought to be a plausible cause. Methods A retrospective analysis of six families and seven patients presenting with triple A syndrome was carried out. The clinical, biochemical and molecular testing data were collected and correlated. The results of treatment and follow-up and genetic counseling of the families were obtained wherever feasible. Results Our cohort consisted mostly of children and displayed a wide phenotypic variability in the presenting symptoms ranging from hypoglycemic seizures at the severe end of the spectrum to insidious hyperpigmentation and delayed development. Neurological and autonomic features were present in a few patients, suggesting requirement of prolonged follow-up for these patients. A significant gap between the onset of symptoms and confirmatory diagnosis was noted, suggesting that a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing this disorder. Sudden unexplained death was observed in siblings, and early diagnosis and treatment could help in preventing early mortality and improving the quality of life for these patients.

C20/A4 cells were cultured and maintained in 9-cm petri dishes containing either HGA at 0.33 mM, a single interleukin (IL-1β, IL-6 or IL-10) at 1 ng/ml or a combination of HGA and a single interleukin. Statistical analysis of pigment deposits and cell viability was performed using analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls post-test. All cultures containing HGA showed a significant increase in pigment deposition compared to control and IL cultures alone. The cultures containing HGA and IL-6 showed a significant increase in pigment deposits compared to HGA alone. The cell viability counts across all cultures on day 10 demonstrated a significant decrease in cultures containing HGA compared to those which did not. There was no significant difference between cultures containing just HGA or those combined with an interleukin. This work demonstrates a role for cytokines present in the joint(s) in the pigmentation process, particularly IL-6, and that the presence of HGA in joint tissues appears more detrimental to chondrocytes than the presence of any of the interleukins found in response to joint injury, trauma and osteoarthritis (OA).

We examined the incremental effects of 2 (full dose) plus K(+) supplementation versus single polycap (low dose) on risk factors and tolerability.METHODS AND RESULTS: After a run-in period, 518 individuals with previous vascular disease or diabetes mellitus from 27 centers in India were randomly assigned to a single-dose polycap or to 2 capsules of the polycap plus K(+) supplementation for 8 weeks. The effects on BP, heart rate (HR), serum lipids, serum and urinary K(+), and tolerability were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis. The full-dose polycap (plus K(+) supplementation) reduced BP by a further 2.8 mm Hg systolic and 1.7 mm Hg diastolic, compared with that observed with the low-dose polycap (P=0.003; P=0.001), but there were no differences in HR (0.1 bpm). The differences in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol between the full-dose and low-dose polycap was 7.2 mg/dL (P=0.014) and 6.6 mg/dL (P=0.006), respectively, but there were no differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. The rates of discontinuation of the study drug after randomization were similar in the 2 groups (6.9% low dose versus 7.8% full dose).CONCLUSIONS: The full-dose polycap (plus K(+) supplementation) reduces BP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a greater extent compared with the low dose, with similar tolerability.

Plasma concentrations of each drug and, where applicable, its active metabolite were measured using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters and their standard deviations were computed for each analyte.RESULTS: Comparative bioavailability was computed and no drug-drug interactions and no difference in comparative bioavailability were concluded for each ingredient based on point estimates of the T/R ratio of the geometric means falling within 80-125% for peak plasma concentration (C(max)), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC(t)), and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)). The T/R ratio for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) was within 80-125% for atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, ramiprilat and dose-normalized salicylic acid. However, for simvastatin, the T/R point estimates for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) for Ln-transformed data were significantly lower ( approximately 3-4%) than the lower bound of 80%. For its active metabolite, simvastatin acid, these estimates were significantly higher ( approximately 25-35%) than the higher bound of 125%.

When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population.FINDINGS: SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and divergence patterns consistent with selection sweeps by evaluating allele frequencies in windows, including neighboring loci from two or more populations of a diploid species against the genome-wide neutral expectation. The program calculates the mean of heterozygosity and FST in a set of sliding windows of incrementally increasing sizes, and then builds a resampled distribution (the baseline) of random multi-locus sets matched to the sizes of sliding windows, using an unrestricted sampling. Percentiles of the values in the sliding windows are derived from the superimposed resampled distribution. The resampling can easily be scaled from 1 K to 100 M; the higher the number, the more precise the percentiles ascribed to the extreme observed values.CONCLUSIONS: The output from SmileFinder can be used to plot percentile values to look for population diversity and divergence patterns that may suggest past actions of positive selection along chromosome maps, and to compare lists of suspected candidate genes under random gene sets to test for the overrepresentation of these patterns among gene categories. Both applications of the algorithm have already been used in published studies. Here we present a publicly available, open source program that will serve as a useful tool for preliminary scans of selection using worldwide databases of human genetic variation, as well as population datasets for many non-human species, from which such data is rapidly emerging with the advent of new genotyping and sequencing technologies."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of our open-source sweep-detection software OmegaPlus, which implements all four parallelization strategies presented here, with a variety of neutrality tests", "answer_start": 1968}], "question": "Which software are used for the detection of selective sweeps?", "id": "5cd96eb2a49efeb44c000003_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Linkage disequilibrium is defined as the non-random associations of alleles at different loci, and it occurs when genotypes at the two loci depend on each other. The model of genetic hitchhiking predicts that strong positive selection affects the patterns of linkage disequilibrium around the site of a beneficial allele, resulting in specific motifs of correlation between neutral polymorphisms that surround the fixed beneficial allele. Increased levels of linkage disequilibrium are observed on the same side of a beneficial allele, and diminish between sites on different sides of a beneficial mutation. This specific pattern of linkage disequilibrium occurs more frequently when positive selection has acted on the population rather than under various neutral models. Thus, detecting such patterns could accurately reveal targets of positive selection along a recombining chromosome or a genome. Calculating linkage disequilibria in whole genomes is computationally expensive because allele correlations need to be evaluated for millions of pairs of sites. To analyze large datasets efficiently, algorithmic implementations used in modern population genetics need to exploit multiple cores of current workstations in a scalable way. However, population genomic datasets come in various types and shapes while typically showing SNP density heterogeneity, which makes the implementation of generally scalable parallel algorithms a challenging task.FINDINGS: Here we present a series of four parallelization strategies targeting shared-memory systems for the computationally intensive problem of detecting genomic regions that have contributed to the past adaptation of the species, also referred to as regions that have undergone a selective sweep, based on linkage disequilibrium patterns. We provide a thorough performance evaluation of the proposed parallel algorithms for computing linkage disequilibrium, and outline the benefits of each approach. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of our open-source sweep-detection software OmegaPlus, which implements all four parallelization strategies presented here, with a variety of neutrality tests.CONCLUSIONS: The computational demands of selective sweep detection algorithms depend greatly on the SNP density heterogeneity and the data representation. Choosing the right parallel algorithm for the analysis can lead to significant processing time reduction and major energy savings. However, determining which parallel algorithm will execute more efficiently on a specific processor architecture and number of available cores for a particular dataset is not straightforward."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons among four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, and OmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times.

The frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use combinations of statistics, maximum likelihood, machine learning etc. In this survey, we present and discuss summary statistics and software tools, and classify them based on the selective sweep signature they detect, i.e., SFS-based vs. LD-based, as well as their capacity to analyze whole genomes or just subgenomic regions. Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons among four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, and OmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times. In equilibrium neutral models or mild bottlenecks, both SFS- and LD-based methods are able to detect selective sweeps accurately. Methods and tools that rely on LD exhibit higher true positive rates than SFS-based ones under the model of a single sweep or recurrent hitchhiking. However, their false positive rate is elevated when a misspecified demographic model is used to represent the null hypothesis. When the correct (or similar to the correct) demographic model is used instead, the false positive rates are considerably reduced. The accuracy of detecting the true target of selection is decreased in bottleneck scenarios. In terms of execution time, LD-based methods are typically faster than SFS-based methods, due to the nature of required arithmetic."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We present RAiSD (Raised Accuracy in Sweep Detection), an open-source software that implements a novel, to our knowledge, and parameter-free detection mechanism that relies on multiple signatures of a selective sweep via the enumeration of SNP vectors.", "answer_start": 254}], "question": "Which software are used for the detection of selective sweeps?", "id": "5cd96eb2a49efeb44c000003_010", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Selective sweeps leave distinct signatures locally in genomes, enabling the detection of loci that have undergone recent positive selection.
