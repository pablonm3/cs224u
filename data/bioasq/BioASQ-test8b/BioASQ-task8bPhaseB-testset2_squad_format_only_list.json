The combination with systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy can increase the severity of radiogenic reactions of normal tissue.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AFTERCARE: The most important differential diagnosis for radiogenic alterations to normal tissue is post-therapeutic tumor recurrence. Besides typical latency periods, location and matching with the radiation field are important differentiation criteria, depending on the tumor biology and the radiation technique.

The grades of fibrosis vary between mild to severe depending on individual radiosensitivity. In this study, we have investigated the molecular pathways that influence RIF and have correlated data from immunohistochemistry (IHC) for von -Willebrand Factor (vWF) and from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) concerning markers such as Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β 1, and vWF, with clinical data concerning the occurrence of WHD during follow-up.METHODS: Expression profiles of the genes encoding TGF-β 1, vWF, and α-procollagen (PC) were analyzed, by RT-PCR, in specimens from patients with (n = 20; 25.6 %) and without (n = 58; 74.4 %) a history of previous RT to the head and neck. Moreover, IHC against vWF was performed. Clinical data on the occurrence of cervical WHDs were analyzed and correlated.RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in the expression profiles of α-PC and TGF-β 1 was observed in previously irradiated skin samples (occurrence of RT >91 days preoperatively). vWF showed a statistically significant increase in non-irradiated tissue. Moreover, analysis of expression profiles in patients with and without WHDs during follow-up was performed. IHC showed a reduced amount of vessels and structural changes in epidermal tissue post-RT.CONCLUSIONS: The expression of markers of fibrosis and angiogenesis was analyzed in order to gain insight into molecular pathways that account for structural changes in irradiated skin and that eventually lead to WHDs.

Acute skin reactions are one of the most common side effects of radiation therapy, and prevention of this adverse event has been investigated in several studies. However, a clinically applicable, preventative treatment remains unavailable. It has been demonstrated that application of a low-power laser can promote tissue repair. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an indium gallium aluminum phosphorus (InGaAIP) laser operated at 660 nm in preventing radiodermatitis in women undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial. A total of 52 patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer (stages I to III) will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group to receive laser therapy (n = 26) or a control group to receive a placebo (n = 26). The laser or placebo will be applied five days a week, immediately before each radiotherapy session. Skin reactions will then be graded weekly by a nurse, a radiotherapist, and an oncologist (all of whom will be blinded) using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) developed by the National Cancer Institute and the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria developed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Patients will also answer a modified visual analogue scale for pain (a self-evaluation questionnaire). Primary and secondary outcomes will be the prevention of radiodermatitis and pain secondary to radiodermatitis, respectively.DISCUSSION: The ideal tool for preventing radiodermatitis is an agent that mediates DNA repair or promotes cell proliferation. Application of a low-power laser has been shown to promote tissue repair by reducing inflammation and inducing collagen synthesis. Moreover, this treatment approach has not been associated with adverse events and is cost-effective. Thus, the results of this ongoing trial may establish whether use of a low-power laser represents an ideal treatment option for the prevention of radiodermatitis.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02003599.

This type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of ETV for treatment of patients with iNPH compared to conservative therapy, or shunting of CSF using VP or VA shunts.To assess the perioperative and postoperative complication rates in patients with iNPH after ETV compared to conservative therapy, VP or VA shunting.SEARCH METHODS: We searched for eligible studies using ALOIS: a comprehensive register of dementia studies, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and several bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME).We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) to identify potentially relevant reviews. The search strategy was adapted for other databases, using the most appropriate controlled vocabulary for each. We did not apply any language or time restrictions. The searches were performed in August 2014.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ETV treatment of iNPH. Patients had to have at least two symptoms of the Hakim-Adams triad. Exclusion criteria were obstructive causes of hydrocephalus, other significant intracranial pathology and other confirmed causes of dementia. The eligible comparators were conservative treatment or shunting using VP and VA shunts.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened search results, selected eligible studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for additional data.MAIN RESULTS: Only one study met the inclusion criteria: an RCT comparing effectiveness of ETV and non-programmable VP shunts in 42 patients with iNPH. The study was conducted in Brazil between 2009 and 2012. The overall study risk of bias was high. The primary outcome in the study was the proportion of patients with improved symptoms one year after surgery, determined as a change of at least two points on the Japanese NPH scale. Due to imprecision in the results, it was not possible to determine whether there was any difference between groups in the proportion of patients who improved 3 or 12 months after surgery (3 months: odds ration (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.76, n = 42; 12 months: OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.62 to 10.11, n = 38). We were unable to estimate the effect of treatment on other efficacy outcomes (cognition, balance, function, gait and mobility) because they were inadequately reported. Of the 26 patients in the VP shunting group, 5 developed subdural hematoma postoperatively, while there were no complications among the 16 patients in the ETV group (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.3, n = 42), but the estimate was too imprecise to determine whether this was likely to reflect a true difference in complication rates. This was also the case for rates of further surgical intervention (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.31 to 6.24, n = 42). There were no deaths during the trial. We judged the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be very low because of a high risk of selection, attrition and reporting bias and serious imprecision in the results.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The only randomised trial of ETV for iNPH compares it to an intervention which is not a standard practice (VP shunting using a non-programmable valve). The evidence from this study is inconclusive and of very low quality. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the evidence. There is a need for more robust research on this topic to be able to determine the effectiveness of ETV in patients with iNPH."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The definition of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), in adults, associates clinical signs (Adams and Hakim triad) involving gait disorders, urinary incontinence and dementia, associated with aspects on brain imaging that are consistent with this hypothesis and also normal or slightly increased intracranial pressure.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?", "id": "5e2f9e0dfbd6abf43b000034_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The definition of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), in adults, associates clinical signs (Adams and Hakim triad) involving gait disorders, urinary incontinence and dementia, associated with aspects on brain imaging that are consistent with this hypothesis and also normal or slightly increased intracranial pressure.

From the 43 initially sorted, only 13 have been selected using exclusion criteria. The proposed methods are very sparse and focused on the improvement after surgical shunt. This focus is independent from the diagnosis criteria proposed in 2005. This introduces an ambiguity in the interpretation of the results. In practice, the diagnosis of NPH is more difficult in the elderly population where differential diagnoses are frequent, particularly vascular lesions (notably microangiopathy) and Alzheimer's disease. The more invasive techniques as continuous spinal drainage (usually during 3 days) or some features of CSF dynamics (Rout, compliance) seem to be the best predictors of after shunt improvement. However, these techniques are difficult to use in routine in the elderly. The combination of Evans index and corpus callosum angle on MRI is very useful to improve the differential diagnosis with cerebral atrophy. Spinal tap test (lumbar puncture with the removal of 40 mL of CSF) can be repeated two or three times for consecutive days to improve the predictive value before shunting.

My topics are etiology, herniosis, diverticulosis coli, and cancer. Hippocrates blamed wear and tear for herniation. Russell's (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) explanation was congenital peritoneal \"buds\" extending down to the pelvis. Harrison (Arch Surg 4:680-689, 1922) attributed herniae to transversalis fascial degradation. Keith (Lancet 2(17):1398-1399, 1906) concluded that pathology was involved, even though Russell (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) had denied it. Nevertheless, the congenital theory prevailed. According to McVay (Christopher's textbook of surgery, W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1960, p. 159), defects arise in normal musculo-aponeurotic structures. Research showed that atrophy was caused by damaged fibroblasts producing less collagen, which was abnormal (having a reduced I/III ratio). The disease was systemic, later named herniosis. Nicotine addiction increased the incidence of herniation by an inflammatory process named metastatic emphysema. In 1948, Saint's Triad, an aggregation of hiatus hernia (later, any primary hernia), gallstones, and diverticulosis coli, was introduced. This association occurred eight times more often than expected, with herniosis appearing to be its cause, abetted by high blood cholesterol causing gallstones. In 2006, Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) provided evidence that colon cancer is accompanied by a reduction in diverticula. Klinge et al. (Hernia 8(4):300-301, 2004) showed that these entities require different extracellular matrices (ECMs). Ghajar and Bissell (Histochem Cell Biol 130:1105-1118, 2008) pointed out that the ECM, which comprises 80% of the breast, influences its epithelial genetic expression, likewise with other organs (kidney, skin, lung, colon, and ovaries). Recently, a fundamental change in our understanding of cancer growth and metastasis has taken place. Whereas the degradation of connective tissue was thought to encourage invasion, eliciting concern for the herniated, now, investigators report the reverse, a reactive vascularized stroma resembling wound healing with an increase in fibroblasts and collagen I. Words such as desmoplasia, fibrosis, and stiffening abound. In conclusion, degradation of the ECM may be why herniosis appears to be hostile to the development of cancer throughout the body. Studies are needed of patients with and without a history of hernia to determine their incidence of cancer. Data from smokers should be separated, since they carry their own high risk of malignancy."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Remarkably, clinical studies of Saint's triad extending over the past 60 years have repeatedly demonstrated a highly significant relationship between colonic diverticula and abdominal herniae.

Wound healing may be affected, leading to recurrences after hernia repair or primary incisional herniation. Women with genitourinary prolapse show signs of herniosis in the pelvis. Diverticulosis coli, commonly seen in the elderly, like hernia, was once attributed to stress and strain from constipation. It is now suspected that herniosis weakens the colonic ECM, allowing the mucosa to form diverticula by herniating alongside the vasa recta. Remarkably, clinical studies of Saint's triad extending over the past 60 years have repeatedly demonstrated a highly significant relationship between colonic diverticula and abdominal herniae. Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) reported that diverticula and cancer are rarely coincident in the colon, despite aging. Their data indicate that the two pathologies arise in different ECMs. Klinge et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 22:515-520, 2007), quoting Paget (Lancet 1:571-573, 1889), \"Tumor cells can like seeds only grow if they fall on congenial soil,\" suggested that certain genes prevent stromal malignancy by influencing the microenvironment to stop epithelia from becoming cancerous. Thus, damage to the colonic ECM from hernial disease is conducive to diverticulosis, but hostile for cancer. Hernial disease being systemic, a similar ECM should be present throughout the body. Coincident diverticulosis and herniae support this hypothesis. Its validation requires further research involving the lifetime risk of cancer in patients with and without hernia.

Chi-square tests and calculated odds ratios (ORs) were utilized to describe the magnitude of association, and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the variables associated with Saint's triad.RESULTS: Among 637,518 patient records (1996-2005), any hernia was diagnosed among 22,181 (3.5%) patients, hiatus hernia among 1,661 (0.3%), diverticulosis of the colon among 14,375 (2.3%), and gallbladder disease among 5,284 (0.8%). The following associations were observed: diverticulosis, hiatus hernia (OR: 6.9), hiatus hernia, gallbladder disease (OR = 3.8), and gallbladder disease, diverticulosis (OR = 5.9). Patients with both diverticulosis and gallbladder disease were more likely to have hiatus hernia (OR = 3.8; P = 0.0012) or any hernia (OR = 10.7; P < 0.0001). Diseases associated with Saint's triad (incorporating any hernia) included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 4.3), hypertension (OR = 3.1), aortic aneurysm (OR = 2.2), and diabetes (OR = 1.8).CONCLUSIONS: Herniosis, the systemic connective tissue disease known to cause diverticulosis and herniae, may be responsible for Saint's triad.

Over 200 G1/S genes are regulated by either one of the two TF complexes, SBF and MBF, which bind to specific DNA binding sequences, SCB and MCB, respectively.

G1/S network expansion took place by both cis- and trans- co-evolutionary changes in closely related but distinct regulatory sequences.

We report on a new case from a third independent family with the homozygous nonsense mutation, c.2659C>T, p.R887* in exon 15 of DSG1 (desmoglein 1 gene). This mutation led to mRNA decay and loss of expression of desmoglein 1. The clinical phenotype consisted of severe palmoplantar keratoderma, dermatitis and multiple allergies.

To date, only 3 families have been reported.OBJECTIVE: We studied a new case of SAM syndrome known to have no mutations in DSG1 to detail the clinical, histopathologic, immunofluorescent, and ultrastructural phenotype and to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms in this rare genodermatosis.METHODS: Histopathologic, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescent studies were performed. Whole-exome sequencing data were interrogated for mutations in desmosomal and other skin structural genes, followed by Sanger sequencing of candidate genes in the patient and his parents.RESULTS: No mutations were identified in DSG1; however, a novel de novo heterozygous missense c.1757A>C mutation in the desmoplakin gene (DSP) was identified in the patient, predicting the amino acid substitution p.His586Pro in the desmoplakin polypeptide.CONCLUSIONS: SAM syndrome can be caused by mutations in both DSG1 and DSP. Knowledge of this genetic heterogeneity is important for both analysis of patients and genetic counseling of families. This condition and these observations reinforce the importance of heritable skin barrier defects, in this case desmosomal proteins, in the pathogenesis of atopic disease.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Here we describe a new syndrome featuring severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM syndrome) caused by homozygous mutations in DSG1. DSG1 encodes desmoglein 1, a major constituent of desmosomes, which connect the cell surface to the keratin cytoskeleton and have a crucial role in maintaining epidermal integrity and barrier function. Mutations causing SAM syndrome resulted in lack of membrane expression of DSG1, leading to loss of cell-cell adhesion. In addition, DSG1 deficiency was associated with increased expression of a number of genes encoding allergy-related cytokines. Our deciphering of the pathogenesis of SAM syndrome substantiates the notion that allergy may result from a primary structural epidermal defect."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The rate of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events was 31.2% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.1% with chemotherapy. ical; CheckMate 227 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02477826 .).", "answer_start": 1829}], "question": "Which drugs were tested in the CheckMate 227 clinical trial?", "id": "5e30f12afbd6abf43b000041_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed promising efficacy for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a phase 1 trial, and tumor mutational burden has emerged as a potential biomarker of benefit. In this part of an open-label, multipart, phase 3 trial, we examined progression-free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy among patients with a high tumor mutational burden (≥10 mutations per megabase).METHODS: We enrolled patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC that was not previously treated with chemotherapy. Those with a level of tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of at least 1% were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab monotherapy, or chemotherapy; those with a tumor PD-L1 expression level of less than 1% were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy. Tumor mutational burden was determined by the FoundationOne CDx assay.RESULTS: Progression-free survival among patients with a high tumor mutational burden was significantly longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy. The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 42.6% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 13.2% with chemotherapy, and the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 13.2) versus 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.4 to 5.8) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 97.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.81; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 45.3% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 26.9% with chemotherapy. The benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab over chemotherapy was broadly consistent within subgroups, including patients with a PD-L1 expression level of at least 1% and those with a level of less than 1%. The rate of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events was 31.2% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.1% with chemotherapy. ical; CheckMate 227 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02477826 .).CONCLUSIONS: Progression-free survival was significantly longer with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy among patients with NSCLC and a high tumor mutational burden, irrespective of PD-L1 expression level.

However, the optimal selection of eligible patients who will benefit most, is far from being clear and the best biomarker has not yet been established. PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in NSCLC patients has shown some value for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in some studies, but not in others, and its use has been complicated by a number of factors which has prompted many researchers to establish better predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy of NSCLC. Most recently, two phase III first-line NSCLC studies have provided evidence that tumour mutational burden (TMB) correlates with the clinical response to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (CheckMate-227; NCT02477826), whereas atezolizumab response was correlated with T effector gene signature expression (IMPower 150; NCT02366143). Both studies demonstrated a significant primary endpoint [progression-free survival (PFS)] benefit in the TMB group and in the group of patients expressing a T effector cell signature, respectively. However, PFS benefit in both studies was seen regardless of the PD-L1 status of all patients suggesting that TMB and T effector cell signatures may be more robust to predict clinical response following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. The role of putative novel predictive biomarkers evaluated in the CheckMate-227 and the IMPower 150 trials may, if confirmed in future prospective studies, offer a new perspective for predicting immunotherapy treatment outcomes of NSCLC patients in the near future."}]}]}
