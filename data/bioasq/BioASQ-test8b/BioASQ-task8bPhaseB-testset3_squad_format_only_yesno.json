In the extant literature, an increased risk of seizures has been described in several inflammatory/autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, so far, relatively few and small size-based studies have been conducted. We aimed to investigate the link between seizure and SLE utilizing a large sample of subjects and extensive data analysis.METHODS: Patients with SLE were compared with age- and sex-matched controls regarding the prevalence of epilepsy in a cross-sectional study. Chi-square and t tests were used for univariate analysis and a logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The study was performed utilizing the medical database of Clalit Health Services.RESULTS: The study included 5,018 patients with SLE and 25,090 age- and gender-frequency-matched controls. The proportion of epilepsy was found significantly higher among SLE patients (4.03 vs. 0.87%, p < 0.001). Using logistic regression, adjusting for multiple confounding factors, older age (≥70 years) resulted as negative predictor (OR 0.42 [95% CI 0.27-0.62], p <0.001), whereas the presence of SLE was a positive predictor of epilepsy (OR 4.70 [95% CI 3.94-5.82], p < 0.001). Interaction between SLE and elderly age resulted in high OR of 5.47 for epilepsy (95% CI 2.53-11.9).CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the higher prevalence of epilepsy in SLE patients. Physicians should be aware of such findings and have a lower threshold for suspecting epileptic seizures in these patients.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the examination method of choice for evaluating radiation-induced brain complications. The purpose of this report is to describe the spectrum of MRI abnormalities detected in a group of survivors of leukemia treated with cranial irradiation.PROCEDURES: In this cross-sectional, single center study, 56 patients (median age at follow-up 19 years) receiving CRT as cranial prophylaxis (CP) included in the leukemia protocol (total dose 1,800-2,400 cGy) and/or in the total body irradiation regimen (990-1,200 cGy) before hematopoietic stem cell transplant, were evaluated by MRI after a median interval of 11 years (range 2-27) following CRT.RESULTS: Fifty-nine MRI abnormalities (32 cavernomas, nine focal areas of gliosis, seven dystrophic mineralizations, five cerebral atrophies, four pituitary atrophies, one diffuse radiation leukoencephalopathy, and one meningioma) were found in 43 patients. The longest interval between CRT and MRI and oldest age at follow-up represented the two risk factors that were statistically associated with MRI lesions (P = 0.032 and 0.033, respectively). Cerebral cavernomas (CC) were the most frequent MRI abnormalities (57%). All patients with CC were asymptomatic at diagnosis and during follow-up, except one who had aspecific neurological manifestations and micro hemorrhages.CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that total doses and modalities of fractionation dose of CRT were not significantly associated with MRI abnormalities.

Irradiated cells also show genomic instability, as do adjacent non-irradiated cells (the bystander effect); the importance to carcinogenesis remains to be established. Current knowledge of radiation effects is largely dependent on evidence from exposure to atomic bomb whole body radiation, leading to increases in a wide range of malignancies. In contrast, millions of people were exposed to radioactive isotopes in the fallout from the Chernobyl accident, within the first 20 years there was a large increase in thyroid carcinoma incidence and a possible radiation-related increase in breast cancer, but as yet there is no general increase in malignancies. The increase in thyroid carcinoma, attributable to the very large amounts of iodine 131 released, was first noticed in children with a strong relationship between young age at exposure and risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The extent of the increase, the reasons for the relationship to age at exposure, the reduction in attributable fraction with increasing latency and the role of environmental factors are discussed. The large number of radiation-induced PTCs has allowed new observations. The subtype and molecular findings change with latency; most early cases were solid PTCs with RET-PTC3 rearrangements, later cases were classical PTCs with RET-PTC1 rearrangements. Small numbers of many other RET rearrangements have occurred in 'Chernobyl' PTCs, and also rearrangement of BRAF. Five of the N-terminal genes found in papillary carcinoma rearrangements are also involved in rearrangements in hematological malignancies; three are putative tumor suppressor genes, and two are further genes fused to RET in PTCs. Radiation causes double-strand breaks; the rearrangements common in these radiation-induced tumors reflect their etiology. It is suggested that oncogenic rearrangements may commonly involve both a tumor-suppressor gene (or a DNA repair gene) as well as an oncogene. Involvement of two relevant genes would give a greater chance of progression and a shorter latency than a single-gene mutation. More information is needed on germline mutations conferring susceptibility to radiation-induced PTCs, particularly DNA repair genes. The radiation exposure to the fallout after Chernobyl was very different from the whole body radiation after the atomic bombs. The type and molecular pathology of the thyroid tumors is changing with increasing latency, long latency tumors in other organs could occur in the future.

Other late effects have also been identified, such as pulmonary dysfunction, endocrinopathies (thyroid dysfunction, infertility), neck muscle atrophy, and persistent fatigue. HL survivors have two- to fourfold increased risks to develop SMNs and CVD compared with the general population. With respect to SMNs, radiotherapy is associated with 1.5- to 15-fold increased risk of solid malignancies. The relative risk (RR) of solid tumors increases steadily with increasing follow-up time from 5 to 15 years since radiotherapy, and remains elevated for at least 40 years. The RR of solid SMNs increases strongly with younger age at first treatment. Risks of lung, breast, and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers increase with higher radiation dose. Alkylating agent chemotherapy, especially procarbazine, does not only increase risk of leukemia but also of solid malignancies, in particular, cancers of the lung and GI tract. In contrast, gonadotoxic chemotherapy decreases the risk of radiation-associated breast cancer, through induction of premature menopause. Smoking appears to multiply the radiation- and chemotherapy-associated risks of lung cancer. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for HL may cause cardiovascular toxicity. Radiotherapy increases the risk of coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure (HF), and pericarditis, whereas anthracycline-containing chemotherapy increases the risks of HF and valvular heart disease. Cardiovascular toxicity following radiotherapy is usually observed from 5 to at least 35 years after therapy, whereas anthracycline-related toxicity is already observed during treatment, up to at least 25 years. The joint effects of anthracyclines, radiotherapy, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, smoking, and physical inactivity) appear to be additive rather than multiplicative.

Screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) may allow detection of early stage, resectable cancers. We developed a Markov decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model to estimate the merits of annual LDCT screening among HL survivors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Population databases and HL-specific literature informed key model parameters, including lung cancer rates and stage distribution, cause-specific survival estimates, and utilities. Relative risks accounted for radiation therapy (RT) technique, smoking status (>10 pack-years or current smokers vs not), age at HL diagnosis, time from HL treatment, and excess radiation from LDCTs. LDCT assumptions, including expected stage-shift, false-positive rates, and likely additional workup were derived from the National Lung Screening Trial and preliminary results from an internal phase 2 protocol that performed annual LDCTs in 53 HL survivors. We assumed a 3% discount rate and a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).RESULTS: Annual LDCT screening was cost effective for all smokers. A male smoker treated with mantle RT at age 25 achieved maximum QALYs by initiating screening 12 years post-HL, with a life expectancy benefit of 2.1 months and an incremental cost of $34,841/QALY. Among nonsmokers, annual screening produced a QALY benefit in some cases, but the incremental cost was not below the WTP threshold for any patient subsets. As age at HL diagnosis increased, earlier initiation of screening improved outcomes. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the model was most sensitive to the lung cancer incidence and mortality rates and expected stage-shift from screening.CONCLUSIONS: HL survivors are an important high-risk population that may benefit from screening, especially those treated in the past with large radiation fields including mantle or involved-field RT. Screening may be cost effective for all smokers but possibly not for nonsmokers despite a small life expectancy benefit.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

All patients were homogeneously treated using an intraoperative dynamic planning prostate brachytherapy technique, with loose 125-iodine seeds and a prescription dose of 145Gy. The mean follow-up was 132 months.RESULTS: The 10-year overall survival for the entire cohort was 92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90-94).

The relationship between therapeutic modality for prostate cancer as well as age or smoking status and comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer was examined.RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 4.3 and 3.1 years, secondary bladder cancer occurred in 11 (3.4%) and 5 (1.1%) of patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, respectively. The 5-year bladder cancer-free survival rate was 97.3% in the external beam radiotherapy group and 99.4% in the radical prostatectomy group. Age (hazard ratio = 1.15, P = 0.027) and ever smoking (hazard ratio = 5.65, P = 0.011) were significant predictive factors of secondary bladder cancer incidence in the external beam radiotherapy cohort, but not in the radical prostatectomy cohort. Inversely, among men with ever smoking, but not among older men, external beam radiotherapy (hazard ratio = 9.64, P = 0.0052) was a significant risk factor of secondary bladder cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that smoking history might be one of criteria to choose radical prostatectomy than external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and that age would not be a criterion for therapeutic selection in terms of secondary bladder cancer.© The Author 2016.

The relationship between therapeutic modality for prostate cancer as well as age or smoking status and comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer was examined.RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 4.3 and 3.1 years, secondary bladder cancer occurred in 11 (3.4%) and 5 (1.1%) of patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, respectively. The 5-year bladder cancer-free survival rate was 97.3% in the external beam radiotherapy group and 99.4% in the radical prostatectomy group. Age (hazard ratio = 1.15, P = 0.027) and ever smoking (hazard ratio = 5.65, P = 0.011) were significant predictive factors of secondary bladder cancer incidence in the external beam radiotherapy cohort, but not in the radical prostatectomy cohort. Inversely, among men with ever smoking, but not among older men, external beam radiotherapy (hazard ratio = 9.64, P = 0.0052) was a significant risk factor of secondary bladder cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that smoking history might be one of criteria to choose radical prostatectomy than external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and that age would not be a criterion for therapeutic selection in terms of secondary bladder cancer.© The Author 2016.

Aβ is produced from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) followed by γ-secretase. Verubecestat is an oral BACE-1 inhibitor that reduces the Aβ level in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 78-week trial to evaluate verubecestat at doses of 12 mg and 40 mg per day, as compared with placebo, in patients who had a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The coprimary outcomes were the change from baseline to week 78 in the score on the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog; scores range from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating worse dementia) and in the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory scale (ADCS-ADL; scores range from 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating worse function).RESULTS: A total of 1958 patients underwent randomization; 653 were randomly assigned to receive verubecestat at a dose of 12 mg per day (the 12-mg group), 652 to receive verubecestat at a dose of 40 mg per day (the 40-mg group), and 653 to receive matching placebo. The trial was terminated early for futility 50 months after onset, which was within 5 months before its scheduled completion, and after enrollment of the planned 1958 patients was complete.

We have used an enhancer trap to determine whether other glucocorticoid-regulated genes exist in AtT-20 cells. An enhancer trap is a recombinant construction containing a selectable marker driven by a promoter that has been weakened by removal of its enhancers so that the transfected trap is only expressed if it comes under the influence of an endogenous enhancer. For a selectable marker, we used a fusion gene coding for hygromycin phosphotransferase (Hy) and herpes simplex thymidine kinase. Thus, expression of this gene conferred hygromycin resistance and ganciclovir sensitivity. Suppression resulted in ganciclovir resistance and hygromycin sensitivity. An enhancerless promoter was produced using a truncated, transcriptionally inactive, form of the POMC promoter. AtT-20/D1 cells were transfected with this construct and cultured in medium containing hygromycin to kill any cells not expressing the Hy gene. The survivors were cultured in medium containing ganciclovir and dexamethasone and cloned. Clones in which the transgene was down-regulated by dexamethasone survived and were designated AtT-20/NET (for negative enhancer trap). Northern blot analysis confirmed that the transgene was down-regulated by dexamethasone as expected and that in at least one instance, suppression of the transgene was more complete than suppression of the full-length POMC promoter. Southern blot analysis after restriction enzyme digestion showed that each cell clone contained a single copy of the transgene, and PCR analysis of the promoter region showed that insertion had occurred in two unique sites in at least two cell clones. Another plasmid construct was prepared that contained the selectable gene but lacked any promoter elements. After transfection of AtT-20 cells with this vector, up-regulated enhancers were trapped by selection in hygromycin and dexamethasone followed by ganciclovir alone and designated AtT-20/PET cells (for positive enhancer trap). Up-regulation of the selectable gene in AtT-20/PET cells was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of dexamethasone-treated cells. In summary, glucocorticoid-regulated enhancers have been identified in AtT-20/D1 cells by an enhancer trap strategy that uses sequential selection under conditions that test whether the transgene is active. These results indicate that in addition to the well characterized, down-regulated POMC gene, there are other glucocorticoid-regulated genes in AtT-20/D1 cells that are both up-regulated and down-regulated by glucocorticoids."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The E1a gene of adenovirus encodes two proteins, 289 and 243 amino acids long, which have positive (transactivator) and negative (enhancer repressor) RNA polymerase II transcriptional regulatory properties and cell transformation activities including cooperation with an activated ras gene.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Are there negative enhancers?", "id": "5d35eb01b3a638076300000f_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The E1a gene of adenovirus encodes two proteins, 289 and 243 amino acids long, which have positive (transactivator) and negative (enhancer repressor) RNA polymerase II transcriptional regulatory properties and cell transformation activities including cooperation with an activated ras gene.

To understand whether the transcriptional regulatory activities of E1a are related to its ras cooperation activity, we generated a series of mutant E1a expression vectors by linker insertion mutagenesis of the 289-amino-acid protein. Here we describe a new class of mutants which although defective for enhancer repression still can cooperate with the ras oncogene in cell transformation. The mutants are also defective in transcription transactivation. Our data suggest that enhancer repression and transformation via ras cooperation are separate E1a functions and that cooperation with ras does not rely on either of the RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory functions of E1a.

MSC alone at 3 days post-cisplatin, after renal functional deficits were obvious, significantly improved 7-day survival of animals. Survival was further improved by pFUS and MSC. pFUS prior to MSC injections increased IL-10 production by MSC that homed to kidneys and generated an anti-inflammatory immune cell profile in treated kidneys.

Oral tolerance was assessed by analysing antibody responses after a systemic antigen challenge. OVA-specific Tregs were assessed in the Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen in wild-type and TLR2(-/-) mice. Low-dose Pam3 CSK4 was also tested as an oral adjuvant.RESULTS: Oral tolerance was successfully induced in both wild-type and TLR2(-/-) recipient mice, with an associated regulatory T-cell response. Oral TLR2 activation, with low-dose Pam3 CSK4 or FSL-1, during oral antigen exposure was found to alter oral tolerance and was associated with the development of substantial IgE and IgA responses to foods upon systemic challenge. Low-dose oral Pam3 CSK4 treatment also selectively enhanced antigen-specific IgA responses to oral antigen exposure.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: TLR2 is not necessary for oral tolerance induction, but oral TLR2 activation modulates humoral IgE and IgA responses during tolerance development.

These observations are pertinent to the optimization of oral allergen immunotherapy and oral vaccine development.© 2015 The Authors.

Conscious patients with stroke involving limb weakness received either gavestinel at an intravenous loading dose of 800 mg followed by 200 mg every 12 h for five doses, or matching placebo, within 6 h of stroke onset. Stratification variables were age and stroke severity. A computed tomography brain scan within 18 h of stroke onset identified the primary efficacy population with ischaemic stroke.

Excess glutamate release is a pivotal event in the evolution of irreversible ischaemic damage in animal models of ischaemia, and drugs that modulate glutamate action either by inhibiting its release, or blocking post-synaptic receptors, are potent neuroprotective agents. Many clinical trials with EAA modulating drugs have been conducted, none individually demonstrating efficacy.OBJECTIVES: To synthesise all the available data on all different classes of EAA modulators and to evaluate evidence of effects on outcome systematically.SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant trials were identified in the Specialised Register of Controlled Trials (last searched May 2001). In addition, MEDLINE and EMBASE online searches for the terms \"neuroprotection\" (and its variants), \"neuroprotective agent\", for all individual drugs and drug classes included in the review, hand searches of conference proceedings from European, International, American Heart Association and Princeton conferences on Stroke, American Neurological Association and American Academy of Neurology meetings from 1992-2001, and direct contact with individual investigators and pharmaceutical companies.SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials were included if they were randomised, controlled studies giving agents with pharmacological properties that included modification of release of EAAs, or blockade of EAA receptors, in stroke within 24h of onset. Efficacy analysis was restricted to trials with a parallel group design: dose escalation studies were excluded. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed on all data. Outcome had to be reported in terms of death or dependence 1-12 months after the acute event.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were available for 36 of 41 relevant trials identified, involving 11,209 subjects. Data were unavailable for 632 participants (517 in trials fulfilling criteria for efficacy analysis). Seven trials did not report disability data, which were available for 29 trials involving 10,802 subjects. Twenty one of these trials, involving 10,342 subjects, were parallel group studies included in the primary efficacy analysis. Efficacy analysis included data derived from 9 trials not primarily designed to assess efficacy (1022 subjects). The primary (efficacy) end-point was the proportion of patients dead or disabled at final follow-up (defined by Barthel Index<60 at 3 months by preference). Mortality was a secondary end-point. Drugs were considered as individual agents, and also grouped principally into categories of ion channel modulators (glutamate release inhibition) and NMDA antagonists.MAIN RESULTS: There was no significant heterogeneity of outcome amongst individual drugs, or of drug classes either for the primary efficacy analysis (death or dependence) or for mortality at final follow-up. For the primary efficacy analysis, odds of death or dependence were 1.03 [95% confidence interval 0.96-1.12], and for mortality 1.02 [0.92-1.12]. Neither ion channel modulators (death or dependence 1.02 [0.90-1.16]) nor NMDA antagonists (death or dependence 1.05 [0.95-1.16]) differed from the principal analysis including all compounds. Trends for increased mortality with three NMDA antagonists were seen - selfotel (OR 1.19 [0.81-1.74]), aptiganel (OR 1.32 [0.91-1.93]) and gavestinel (OR 1.12 [0.95-1.32]) - but this did not achieve significance for the NMDA antagonists considered as a class (1.09 [0.96-1.23]). Aptiganel was also associated with a trend towards worse functional outcome (OR 1.20 [0.88-1.65]) although this was not the case for either of the other two compounds. No statistically significant detriment of psychotomimetic NMDA antagonists was found, although a trend towards higher mortality in this sub-group was seen (OR 1.25 [0.96-1.64]).REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of significant benefit or harm from drugs modulating excitatory amino acid action. Reductio]).REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of significant benefit or harm from drugs modulating excitatory amino acid action. Reduction of death or dependence by 8% or more has been excluded for gavestinel and lubeluzole, which contribute most of the data for this review. However, mechanistic understanding of neuroprotection is too poor to extrapolate from these two failed development plans to all glutamate modulators. Further clinical trials of neuroprotective agents remain justified, since confidence limits around estimates of effect remain wide for most agents, and cannot reliably exclude benefit. Although numbers of patients are too small to confirm or refute a trend towards increased mortality with some NMDA antagonists, further commercial development of these agents is exceedingly unlikely."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "No improvement in clinical outcome of stroke has been seen with competitive NMDA antagonists (selfotel) and non-competitive NMDA antagonists (dextrorphan, GV150526, aptiganel and eliprodil).", "answer_start": 418}], "question": "Is Aptiganel effective for treatment of stroke?", "id": "5e44c76f48dab47f26000022_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "During cerebral ischaemia, glutamate is released in supraphysiological amounts and is toxic to brain tissue. This excitotoxicity is mediated by several glutamate receptor subtypes, including the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Clinical trials of drugs that block the NMDA receptor in acute ischaemic stroke have been disappointing. No improvement in clinical outcome of stroke has been seen with competitive NMDA antagonists (selfotel) and non-competitive NMDA antagonists (dextrorphan, GV150526, aptiganel and eliprodil). The AMPA receptor differs in important ways from the NMDA receptor. It is the principal mediator of fast excitatory neurotransmission. This ligand-gated cation channel is primarily permeable to sodium rather than calcium. It is found in grey and white matter. It is expressed by oligodendrocytes. This distribution may provide neuroprotection for both grey and white matter. In a variety of animal models, reduction in infarct volume with AMPA blockade has been demonstrated. AMPA antagonists also show benefit in spinal cord ischaemia and trauma. The clinical development of safe and effective AMPA blockers has been hampered by poor water solubility and associated renal toxicity.

Two benzothiazolamines, riluzole and lubeluzole, are known blockers of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels. Riluzole is clinically used as a neuroprotectant in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Inhibition of Nav channels by riluzole is voltage-dependent due to preferential binding to inactivated sodium channels. Yet the drug exerts little use-dependent block, probably because it lacks protonable amine. One important property is riluzole ability to inhibit persistent Na+ currents, which likely contributes to its neuroprotective activity. Lubeluzole showed promising neuroprotective effects in animal stroke models, but failed to show benefits in acute ischemic stroke in humans. One important concern is its propensity to prolong the cardiac QT interval, due to hERG K+ channel block. Lubeluzole very potently inhibits Nav channels in a voltage- and use-dependent manner, due to its great preferential affinity for inactivated channels and the presence of a protonable amine group. Patch-clamp experiments suggest that the binding sites of both drugs overlap the local anesthetic receptor within the ion-conducting pathway. Riluzole and lubeluzole displayed very potent antimyotonic activity in a rat model of myotonia, a pathological skeletal muscle condition characterized by high-frequency runs of action potentials.

However, clinical research on lubeluzole is now at a standstill, since lubeluzole seems to be associated with the acquired long QT syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. Since the cardiac cellular effects of lubeluzole have not been described thus far, an explanation for the lubeluzole-induced QT interval prolongation is lacking.METHODS: We tested the affinity of lubeluzole, its enantiomer, and the racemate for hERG channel using the patch-clamp technique. We synthesized and tested two simplified model compounds corresponding to two moieties included in the lubeluzole structure. The obtained experimental results were rationalized by docking simulation on the recently reported cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of hERG. Group efficiency analysis was performed in order to individuate the fragment most contributing to binding.RESULTS: We found that lubeluzole and its R enantiomer are highly potent inhibitors of human ether-ago-go-related gene (hERG) channel with an IC50 value of 12.9 ± 0.7 nM and 11.3 ± 0.8 nM, respectively. In the presence of lubeluzole, steady-state activation and inactivation of hERG channel were shifted to more negative potentials and inactivation kinetics was accelerated. Mutations of aromatic residues (Y652A and F656A) in the channel inner cavity significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of lubeluzole. Molecular docking simulations performed on the near atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of hERG supported the role of Y652 and F656 as the main contributors to high affinity binding. Group efficiency analysis indicated that both 1,3-benzothiazol-2-amine and 3-aryloxy-2-propanolamine moieties contribute to drug binding with the former giving higher contribution.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the possibility to modulate lubeluzole hERG blockade by introducing suitable substituents onto one or both constituting portions of the parent compound in order to either reduce potency (i. e. torsadogenic potential) or potentiate affinity (useful for class III antiarrhythmic and anticancer agent development).© 2018 The Author(s).
