The rekindling of interest in the B-cell pathway has also driven new clinical research into rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 with evaluations of new strategies.

AZD5153 is a novel BRD4 inhibitor.METHODS: Prostate cancer cells were treated with AZD5153. Cell survival was tested by MTT assay and clonogenicity assay. Cell proliferation was tested by [H3] DNA incorporation assay. Cell apoptosis was tested by caspase-3/-9 activity assay, Histone DNA ELISA assay, Annexin V FACS assay and TUNEL staining assay. Cell cycle progression was tested by propidium iodide (PI) FACS assay. Signaling was tested by Western blotting assay. The nude mice PC-3 xenograft model was applied to test AZD5153's activity in vivo.RESULTS: AZD5153 inhibited proliferation and survival of established and primary prostate cancer cells. AZD5153 induced apoptosis activation and cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells. AZD5153 was non-cytotoxic to the prostate epithelial cells. AZD5153 downregulated BRD4 targets (cyclin D1, Myc, Bcl-2, FOSL1 and CDK4) in PC-3 and primary prostate cancer cells. Further studies show that AKT could be the primary resistance factor of AZD5153. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of AKT induced BRD4 downregulation, sensitizing AZD5153-induced cytotoxicity in PC-3 cells. In vivo, AZD5153 oral administration inhibited PC-3 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Its anti-tumor activity was further enhanced with co-treatment of the AKT specific inhibitor MK-2206.CONCLUSION: Together, our results indicate a promising therapeutic value of the novel BRD4 inhibitor AZD5153 against prostate cancer cells.",

However, current methods addressing larger, more complex targets rely on analyzing 6-10 complementary spectra, suggesting the need for alternative approaches. Here, we describe 4D-CHAINS/autoNOE-Rosetta, a complete pipeline for NOE-driven structure determination of medium- to larger-sized proteins. The 4D-CHAINS algorithm analyzes two 4D spectra recorded using a single, fully protonated protein sample in an iterative ansatz where common NOEs between different spin systems supplement conventional through-bond connectivities to establish assignments of sidechain and backbone resonances at high levels of completeness and with a minimum error rate. The 4D-CHAINS assignments are then used to guide automated assignment of long-range NOEs and structure refinement in autoNOE-Rosetta. Our results on four targets ranging in size from 15.5 to 27.3 kDa illustrate that the structures of proteins can be determined accurately and in an unsupervised manner in a matter of days.",

The biggest limitation of CAGE is that even the most recently improved version (nAnT-iCAGE) still requires large amounts of total cellular RNA (5 µg), preventing its application to scarce biological samples such as those from early embryonic development or rare cell types. Here, we present SLIC-CAGE, a Super-Low Input Carrier-CAGE approach to capture 5' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts from as little as 5-10 ng of total RNA. This dramatic increase in sensitivity is achieved by specially designed, selectively degradable carrier RNA. We demonstrate the ability of SLIC-CAGE to generate data for genome-wide promoterome with 1000-fold less material than required by existing CAGE methods, by generating a complex, high-quality library from mouse embryonic day 11.5 primordial germ cells.",

More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals, suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series.",

									"text": "As cancer genomics initiatives move toward comprehensive identification of genetic alterations in cancer, attention is now turning to understanding how interactions among these genes lead to the acquisition of tumor hallmarks. Emerging pharmacological and clinical data suggest a highly promising role of cancer-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as druggable cancer targets. However, large-scale experimental identification of cancer-related PPIs remains challenging, and currently available resources to explore oncogenic PPI networks are limited.Results: Recently, we have developed a PPI high-throughput screening platform to detect PPIs between cancer-associated proteins in the context of cancer cells. Here, we present the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows investigators to access, manipulate and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines. To facilitate prioritization of PPIs for further biological studies, this resource combines network connectivity analysis, mutual exclusivity analysis of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins and domain-domain interactions. Estimates of PPI essentiality allow users to evaluate the functional impact of PPI disruption on cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, connecting the OncoPPi network with the approved drugs and compounds in clinical trials enables discovery of new tumor dependencies to inform strategies to interrogate undruggable targets like tumor suppressors. The OncoPPi Portal serves as a resource for the cancer research community to facilitate discovery of cancer targets and therapeutic development.Availability and implementation: The OncoPPi Portal is available at http://oncoppi.emory.edu.Contact: andrey.ivanov@emory.edu or hfu@emory.edu.",

The seizure types in individuals with TBC1D24 mutations included generalised tonic-clonic, complex partial, focal clonic, and infantile spasms. Of the 18 individuals with DOORS syndrome from 17 families without TBC1D24 mutations, eight did not have seizures and three did not have deafness. In expression studies, some mutations abrogated TBC1D24 mRNA stability. We also detected Tbc1d24 expression in mouse phalangeal chondrocytes and calvaria, which suggests a role of TBC1D24 in skeletogenesis.INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that mutations in TBC1D24 seem to be an important cause of DOORS syndrome and can cause diverse phenotypes. Thus, individuals with DOORS syndrome without deafness and seizures but with the other features should still be screened for TBC1D24 mutations.

We demonstrate Perturb-seq by analyzing 200,000 cells in immune cells and cell lines, focusing on transcription factors regulating the response of dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Perturb-seq accurately identifies individual gene targets, gene signatures, and cell states affected by individual perturbations and their genetic interactions. We posit new functions for regulators of differentiation, the anti-viral response, and mitochondrial function during immune activation. By decomposing many high content measurements into the effects of perturbations, their interactions, and diverse cell metadata, Perturb-seq dramatically increases the scope of pooled genomic assays.",

									"text": "The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression. Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path of the genome sequence in situ. Here we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized to the genome in a cell. To test our approach, we develop a method for the simulation of DNA in an idealized human nucleus. Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes. We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences. By simulating appropriate spatial resolution, label multiplexing and noise scenarios we assess our algorithms performance. Our study shows that it is feasible to achieve genome-wide reconstruction of the 3D DNA path based on super-resolution microscopy images.",

Nevertheless, the clinical significance and biological mechanism of T-UCRs in breast cancer remain largely unknown. The expression of uc.38, a T-UCR, was down-regulated in both breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines. However, uc.38 was expressed at significantly lower levels in larger tumours and tumours of more advanced stages. Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments, up-regulation of uc.38 expression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Thus, uc.38 suppressed breast cancer. Additional experiments revealed that uc.38 negatively regulated the expression of the pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) protein and subsequently affected the expression of Bcl-2 family members, ultimately inducing breast cancer cell apoptosis. Describing the uc.38/PBX1 axis has improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer apoptosis and has suggested that this axis is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.",

The biological function of gastric cancer cells with uc.160 over-expression were investigated, and the interaction between uc.160 and microRNA miR-155 was examined by dual-luciferase reporter assay. PTEN levels were detected by Western blotting. Anti-tumor effects of uc.160 were further explored in tumor transplantation models.RESULTS: uc.160 expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cell lines as compared to adjacent normal tissues and immortalized gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1), respectively. Over-expression of uc.160 in SGC-7901 and AGS gastric cancer cells significantly suppressed their proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, uc.160 positively regulated the tumor suppressor protein PTEN. Interestingly, uc.160 was inhibited by microRNA miR-155 that is also a negative regulator of gastric cancer.CONCLUSION: uc.160 is significantly down-regulated in gastric carcinomas and can inhibit the tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that uc.160 may be used as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of gastric malignancies.",

									"text": "BACKGROUND: Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of noncoding RNAs that are highly conserved among the orthologous regions in most vertebrates. It has been reported that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human cancers. We previously discovered the downregulation of T-UCR expression in gastric cancer (GC), indicating that T-UCRs could play an important role in GC biology. Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs. We also attempted to determine the effect of Uc.160+ expression on biological features of GC cell lines by Western blotting.RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach. Cancer-specific DNA methylation in the promoter region of Uc.160 was observed by bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing analysis. The effect of DNA methylation on Uc.160+ expression was further confirmed by reporter gene assay. We also revealed that Uc.160+ inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt by regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Uc.160+ could possibly have a tumor suppressive role in GC.",

A quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the downregulation of Uc.158+A expression by a DNA methylation-associated mechanism, which was restored by 5-Aza-dC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) treatment. Bisulfite genomic sequencing using cell lines and tissue samples demonstrated cancer-specific CpG hypermethylation in both GC and PCa. However, Uc.416+A was only overexpressed in GC and we identified an miR-153 binding site in the possible regulatory region of Uc.416+A using online databases. Along with a forced expression or knockdown of miR-153 in MKN-74 GC cells, the transcriptional levels of Uc.416+A were significantly disturbed. A luciferase reporter gene assay supported the direct regulation of Uc.416+A expression by miR-153. Furthermore, Uc.416+A was associated with cell growth through the regulation of IGFBP6 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6) in GC. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology.",

Similar effects are observed in Ctf4 and Polα primase mutants that disrupt the connection of the CMG helicase to Polα that resides on lagging-strand template.

									"text": "AND-1/Ctf4 bridges the CMG helicase and DNA polymerase alpha, facilitating replication. Using an inducible degron system in avian cells, we find that AND-1 depletion is incompatible with proliferation, owing to cells accumulating in G2 with activated DNA damage checkpoint. Replication without AND-1 causes fork speed slow-down and accumulation of long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps at the replication fork junction, with these regions being converted to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in G2. Strikingly, resected forks and DNA damage accumulation in G2, but not fork slow-down, are reverted by treatment with mirin, an MRE11 nuclease inhibitor. Domain analysis of AND-1 further revealed that the HMG box is important for fast replication but not for proliferation, whereas conversely, the WD40 domain prevents fork resection and subsequent DSB-associated lethality. Thus, our findings uncover a fork protection function of AND-1/Ctf4 manifested via the WD40 domain that is essential for proliferation and averts genome instability.",
