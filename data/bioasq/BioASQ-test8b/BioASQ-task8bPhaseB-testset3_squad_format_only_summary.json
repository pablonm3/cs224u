Cytoplasmic degradation systems, such as the autophagy-lysosome and proteasome pathways, are involved in their pathogenesis. Autophagy is tightly regulated by several upstream proteins including UNC-51-like kinase 1/2, beclin1, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 34 and autophagy/beclin1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1). Recently, we revealed that both cortical and brainstem-type Lewy bodies were immunopositive for several upstream proteins of autophagy. Therefore, we conducted the present study to elucidate the role of upstream proteins of autophagy in the pathogenesis of MSA. Pathological and biochemical analyses using human brain samples revealed that AMBRA1 is a component of the pathological hallmarks of MSA and upstream proteins of autophagy are impaired in the MSA brain. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed a ninefold stronger affinity of AMBRA1 with α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 compared with non-phosphorylated α-synuclein. Furthermore, a weak but significant correlation between AMBRA1 overexpression and reduction of abnormal α-synuclein was observed. Silencing AMBRA1 function caused aggregates of α-synuclein in the cytoplasm of mouse primary cultured neurons, which was simulated by the treatment of Bafilomycin, an autophagy inhibitor. Our results demonstrated for the first time that AMBRA1 is a novel hub binding protein of α-synuclein and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of MSA through the degradative dynamics of α-synuclein.

Specific properties of α-synuclein, such as its ability to pass from one neuron to another, its tendency to aggregate, and its potential to generate self-propagating species, have been described and elucidated in animal models and may contribute to the relentless exacerbation of Parkinson's disease pathology in patients. Animal models used for studying α-synuclein accumulation, aggregation, and propagation are mostly based on three approaches: (1) intra-parenchymal inoculations of exogenous α-synuclein (e.g., synthetic α-synuclein fibrils), (2) transgenic mice, and (3) animals (mice or rats) in which α-synuclein overexpression is induced by viral vector injections. Whereas pathological α-synuclein changes are consistently observed in these models, important differences are also found. In particular, pronounced pathology in transgenic mice and viral vector-injected animals does not appear to involve self-propagating α-synuclein species.

To dissect this process at a mechanistic level, we set up an in vitro system. Sister chromatid resolution is severely impaired upon depletion of Wapl from Xenopus egg extracts. Exogenously added human Wapl can rescue these defects and, remarkably, it can do so in a very short time window of early mitosis.

Characteristic amino acid motifs (the FGF motifs) in Wapl coordinate its physical and functional interactions with Pds5 and cohesin subunits.

Knowing if a reduced Nipped-B or Pds5 dosage changes how much cohesin binds chromosomes, or the stability with which it binds, is critical information for understanding how cohesin regulates transcription. We addressed this question by in vivo fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) with Drosophila salivary glands. Cohesin, Nipped-B, and Pds5 all bind chromosomes in both weak and stable modes, with residence half-lives of some 20 seconds and 6 min, respectively. Reducing the Nipped-B dosage decreases the amount of stable cohesin without affecting its chromosomal residence time, and reducing the Pds5 dosage increases the amount of stable cohesin. This argues that Nipped-B and Pds5 regulate transcription by controlling how much cohesin binds DNA in the stable mode, and not binding affinity.

We recorded occurrence of a second clinical attack (clinically definite multiple sclerosis) at months 36 and 60. We evaluated MRI criteria performance for DIS, DIT, and DIS plus DIT with a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.FINDINGS: Between June 16, 1995, and Jan 27, 2017, 571 patients with CIS were screened, of whom 368 met all study inclusion criteria. At the last evaluation (median 50·0 months [IQR 27·0-78·4]), 189 (51%) of 368 patients developed clinically definite multiple sclerosis. At 36 months, the two DIS criteria showed high sensitivity (2010 McDonald 0·91 [95% CI 0·85-0·94] and 2016 MAGNIMS 0·93 [0·88-0·96]), similar specificity (0·33 [0·25-0·42] and 0·32 [0·24-0·41]), and similar area under the curve values (AUC; 0·62 [0·57-0·67] and 0·63 [0·58-0·67]). Performance was not affected by inclusion of symptomatic lesions (sensitivity 0·92 [0·87-0·96], specificity 0·31 [0·23-0·40], AUC 0·62 [0·57-0·66]) or cortical lesions (sensitivity 0·92 [0·87-0·95], specificity 0·32 [0·24-0·41], AUC 0·62 [0·57-0·67]). Requirement of three periventricular lesions resulted in slightly lower sensitivity (0·85 [0·78-0·90], slightly higher specificity (0·40 [0·32-0·50], and similar AUC (0·63 [0·57-0·68]). Inclusion of optic nerve evaluation resulted in similar sensitivity (0·92 [0·87-0·96]), and slightly lower specificity (0·26 [0·18-0·34]) and AUC (0·59 [0·55-0·64]). AUC values were also similar for DIT (2010 McDonald 0·61 [0·55-0·67] and 2016 MAGNIMS 0·61 [0·55-0·66]) and DIS plus DIT (0·62 [0·56-0·67] and 0·64 [0·58-0·69]).INTERPRETATION: The 2016 MAGNIMS criteria showed similar accuracy to the 2010 McDonald criteria in predicting the development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Inclusion of symptomatic lesions is expected to simplify the clinical use of MRI criteria without reducing accuracy, and our findings suggest that needing three lesions to define periventricular involvement might slightly increase specificity, suggesting that these two factors could be considered during further revisions of multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria.FUNDING: UK MS Society, National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Dutch MS Research Foundation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the pattern of MRI lesions and contributions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum antibody findings that best identifies children with multiple sclerosis, and the applicability of international diagnostic criteria in the paediatric context.METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, detailed clinical assessments, serum and CSF studies, and MRI scans were done in youth (aged 0·46-17·87 years) with incidental acquired demyelinating syndrome. Participants were examined prospectively to identify relapsing disease. All MRI scans were assessed using a validated scoring method. A random forest classifier identified imaging and laboratory features that best predicted a multiple sclerosis or monophasic outcome. Performance of the 2001, 2010, and 2017 international McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, the 2016 MRI in multiple sclerosis (MAGNIMS) criteria, and our 2011 proposed (Verhey) criteria were determined; performance was adjudicated with generalised linear models.FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2004, and June 30, 2017, we included 324 participants with median follow-up of 72 months (range 6-150), 71 (22%) participants with multiple sclerosis, 237 (73%) with monophasic acquired demyelinating syndrome, 14 (4%) with relapsing non-multiple sclerosis, and two (1%) with alternative diagnoses. We scored 2391 brain, 444 spinal, and 67 dedicated orbital MRI scans. One or more T1 hypointense lesions plus one or more periventricular lesions (Verhey criteria) best predicted multiple sclerosis outcome. Performance of the 2017 McDonald criteria was comparable to the 2010 McDonald criteria and was easier to adjudicate. The ability of CSF oligoclonal bands to substitute for the requirement for both enhancing and non-enhancing lesions in the 2017 McDonald criteria improved its performance compared with the 2010 criteria. Myelin oligodendrocyte testing at baseline did not improve performance of the 2017 McDonald criteria.INTERPRETATION: The 2017 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, as applied at the time of incident attack, perform well in identifying children and youth with multiple sclerosis, indicating that the same diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis apply across the age span. The presence of so-called black holes on MRI and periventricular lesions at baseline (Verhey criteria) also effectively distinguish children with multiple sclerosis from children with monophasic demyelination. The presence of CSF oligoclonal bands improve diagnostic accuracy.

We sought to evaluate the reliability of CL detection on DIR longitudinally at multiple subsequent time-points applying the MAGNIMs scoring criteria for CLs.METHODS: 26 MS patients received a 3T-MRI (Siemens, Skyra) with DIR at 12 time-points (TP) within a 16 months period. Scans were assessed in random order by two different raters. Both raters separately marked all CLs on each scan and total lesion numbers were obtained for each scan-TP and patient. After a retrospective re-evaluation, the number of consensus CLs (conL) was defined as the total number of CLs, which both raters finally agreed on. CLs volumes, relative signal intensities and CLs localizations were determined. Both ratings (conL vs. non-consensus scoring) were compared for further analysis.RESULTS: A total number of n = 334 CLs were identified by both raters in 26 MS patients with a first agreement of both raters on 160 out of 334 of the CLs found (κ = 0.48). After the retrospective re-evaluation, consensus agreement increased to 233 out of 334 CL (κ = 0.69). 93.8% of conL were visible in at least 2 consecutive TP. 74.7% of the conL were visible in all 12 consecutive TP. ConL had greater mean lesion volumes and higher mean signal intensities compared to lesions that were only detected by one of the raters (p<0.05). A higher number of CLs in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobe were identified by both raters than the number of those only identified by one of the raters (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: After a first assessment, slightly less than a half of the CL were considered as reliably detectable on longitudinal DIR images. A retrospective re-evaluation notably increased the consensus agreement. However, this finding is narrowed, considering the fact that retrospective evaluation steps might not be practicable in clinical routine. Lesions that were not reliably identifiable by both raters seem to be characterized by lower signal intensity and smaller size, or located in distinct anatomical brain regions."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Minoxidil is the only topical drug for the treatment of both female and male pattern hair loss.

From a US societal perspective, this analysis models the clinical efficacy and estimates the value-based price (VBP) for erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor.METHODS: A Markov health state transition model was developed to estimate the incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and value-based price range for erenumab in migraine prevention. The model comprises \"on preventive treatment\", \"off preventive treatment\", and \"death\" health states across a 10-year time horizon. The evaluation compared erenumab to no preventive treatment in episodic and chronic migraine patients that have failed at least one preventive therapy. Therapeutic benefits are based on estimated changes in monthly migraine days (MMD) from erenumab pivotal clinical trials and a network meta-analysis of migraine studies. Utilities were estimated using previously published mapping algorithms. A VBP analysis was performed to identify maximum erenumab annual prices at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 per QALY. Estimates of VBP under different scenarios such as choice of different comparators, assumptions around inclusion of placebo effect, and exclusion of work productivity losses were also generated.RESULTS: Erenumab resulted in incremental QALYs of 0.185 vs supportive care (SC) and estimated cost offsets due to reduced MMD of $8,482 over 10 years, with an average duration of treatment of 2.01 years. The estimated VBP at WTP thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 for erenumab compared to SC ranged from $14,238-$23,998.

This gradient represents a convolution of multiple spatially separated nuclear domains including two types of transcription \"hot zones.\" Transcription hot zones protruding furthest into the nuclear interior and positioning deterministically very close to nuclear speckles have higher numbers of total genes, the most highly expressed genes, housekeeping genes, genes with low transcriptional pausing, and super-enhancers. Our results demonstrate the capability of TSA-Seq for genome-wide mapping of nuclear structure and suggest a new model for spatial organization of transcription and gene expression."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Large genomic datasets combining genotype and sequence data, such as for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) detection, require perfect matching between both data types.Results: We described here MBV (Match BAM to VCF); a method to quickly solve sample mislabeling and detect cross-sample contamination and PCR amplification bias.Availability and Implementation: MBV is implemented in C ++ as an independent component of the QTLtools software package, the binary and source codes are freely available at https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools/ .", "answer_start": 12}], "question": "What is the Match BAM to VCF method?", "id": "5e3356c0fbd6abf43b00005c_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Motivation: Large genomic datasets combining genotype and sequence data, such as for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) detection, require perfect matching between both data types.Results: We described here MBV (Match BAM to VCF); a method to quickly solve sample mislabeling and detect cross-sample contamination and PCR amplification bias.Availability and Implementation: MBV is implemented in C ++ as an independent component of the QTLtools software package, the binary and source codes are freely available at https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools/ .Contact: olivier.delaneau@unige.ch or emmanouil.dermitzakis@unige.ch.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author 2017.

By fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, the immune response of SR/CR mice after intraperitoneal injection of cancer cells was investigated and compared with parent strain mice. A massive influx of leukocytes into the peritoneal cavity was found. A large fraction of these leukocytes were polymorphonuclear granulocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells. A relative decrease in influx of B-cells compared with controls was demonstrated. Increased proportions of leukocytes belonging to the innate immune system were also demonstrated in splenocytes of SR/CR mice. Cytospins of peritoneal fluid from SR/CR mice after cancer cell injection showed formations of immune cells morphologically resembling polymorphonuclear granulocytes and macrophages adjoining the cancer cells.

Despite their utility, balancer chromosomes are rarely used in mice because they are difficult to generate using conventional methods. Here we describe the engineering of a mouse balancer chromosome with the Cre-loxP recombination system. The chromosome features a 24-centiMorgan (cM) inversion between Trp53 (also known as p53) and Wnt3 on mouse chromosome 11 that is recessive lethal and dominantly marked with a K14-Agouti transgene. When allelic to a wild-type chromosome, the inversion suppresses crossing over in the inversion interval, accompanied by elevated recombination in the flanking regions. The inversion functions as a balancer chromosome because it can be used to maintain a lethal mutation in the inversion interval as a self-sustaining trans-heterozygous stock. This strategy can be used to generate similar genetic reagents throughout the mouse genome.

(For S1-3 see also: Bell, 1954; Sandler, 1972; Cline, 1976). These five distinct effects were initially quantified from estimates of viability in single generation crossing experiments. Dynamic estimates of these fitness parameters were obtained by fitting the elimination rate of da from a series of large random mating cage populations to a recurrence equation by the method of minimum chi-square. The stability of these estimates discerns those effects which are truly pleiotropic versus those due to linked genes. The dynamic estimates supported only S1 and S4 effects. Evidence for S2 and S5 was indeterminate, but the S3 effect was rejected (P less than 0.01). The observed reduction in fitness, supposedly due to this recessive zygotic effect for da, was most likely the result of linked deleterious genes. These results indicate that pleiotropic vital effects observed in single generation test-cross matings may be caused by linked genes rather than the specific mutant per se. This problem is of particular importance when the mutant allele has been maintained with a balancer chromosome. Experiments on the rescue of daughters from da/da mothers with low temperatures during embryogenesis and with dechorionation of eggs were described in which the findings failed to confirm previously reported actions of the da gene.

We used the approach of chromosome extraction, which has both advantages and disadvantages compared to classical techniques, to test the model further. From four isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster, four sets of recombinant extracted lines were constructed using standard balancer-chromosome techniques. The four parental lines and 53 recombinants were reared under controlled laboratory conditions and isolated as pairs for scoring daily fecundity and longevity. Even though the design is not optimal for estimating classical components of genetic variance, it afforded a uniquely direct test of the magnitude of environmental covariances, while giving a detailed genetic picture of part of the genome. There were clear differences among the recombinant series in the distribution of mean longevity and early fecundity. The genetic correlation between early fecundity (sum of egg production for the first five days posteclosion) and female longevity was significantly negative in only one of the recombinant series. When all lines were considered together, the phenotypic correlation between these traits was significantly negative (P < 0.02), while the broad-sense genetic correlation was -0.219 (P < 0.11).

[(3)H]RO5328673 bound to a single saturable site on hNK2, hNK3 and gpNK3 with high-affinity. RO5328673 acted as an insurmountable antagonist at both human and guinea-pig NK3 receptors in the [(3)H]IP accumulation assay.

In electrophysiological recordings of gp SNpc, RO5328673 inhibited the senktide-induced potentiation of spontaneous activity of dopaminergic neurons with an insurmountable mechanism of action. RO5328673 exhibited in-vivo activity in gerbils, robustly reversing the senktide-induced locomotor activity.

However, there is a paucity of data available on long-term H treatment of patients. The Rollover Protocol (ROP) Study was conducted to report safety data for patients with HER2-positive locally advanced/metastatic breast and gastric/GEJ cancer who have received long-term H therapy (≥ 5 years and ≥ 3 years for breast and gastric/GEJ cancer, respectively).METHODS: The ROP Study was a single-arm, multicenter, international continuation trial of H in patients who had previously completed a global Roche-sponsored trial with H therapy, had stable disease, and were receiving H at the end of the lead-in trial. Patients with chronic heart failure during the lead-in trial could be included following a risk-benefit analysis. The primary objectives were to provide H therapy to patients with HER2-overexpressing locally advanced/metastatic breast or gastric/GEJ cancer at the end of the lead-in study, and to follow the long-term outcomes and long-term overall safety in these patients.RESULTS: Twenty-five of 69 patients enrolled in the ROP Study received long-term H therapy (19 breast cancer and 6 gastric/GEJ cancer). The median duration of H treatment for patients with breast cancer was 8 years 7 months, and 5 years 2 months for patients with gastric/GEJ cancer. The cardiac status of the patients remained stable over time, with no serious cardiac adverse events or marked changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The median overall worst LVEF measurement was 57.0%, and no patients experienced an LVEF of < 45% (range 47-63%). There were no serious adverse events related to study treatment.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that H has an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated in patients who received long-term H therapy (≥ 5 years and ≥ 3 years for breast and gastric/GEJ cancer, respectively).

In this study, we show that BRD4-NUT and BRD4 colocalize in discrete nuclear foci that are hyperacetylated but transcriptionally inactive.

Mammalian DGK comprises ten isozymes (α-κ) and regulates a wide variety of physiological and pathological events, such as cancer, type II diabetes, neuronal disorders and immune responses. DG and PA consist of various molecular species that have different acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, and consequently, mammalian cells contain at least 50 structurally distinct DG/PA species. Because DGK is one of the components of phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover, the generally accepted dogma is that all DGK isozymes utilize 18:0/20:4-DG derived from PI turnover. We recently established a specific liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method to analyze which PA species were generated by DGK isozymes in a cell stimulation-dependent manner. Interestingly, we determined that DGKδ, which is closely related to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes, preferentially utilized 14:0/16:0-, 14:0/16:1-, 16:0/16:0-, 16:0/16:1-, 16:0/18:0- and 16:0/18:1-DG species (X:Y = the total number of carbon atoms: the total number of double bonds) supplied from the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C pathway, but not 18:0/20:4-DG, in high glucose-stimulated C2C12 myoblasts. Moreover, DGKα mainly consumed 14:0/16:0-, 16:0/18:1-, 18:0/18:1- and 18:1/18:1-DG species during cell proliferation in AKI melanoma cells. Furthermore, we found that 16:0/16:0-PA was specifically produced by DGKζ in Neuro-2a cells during retinoic acid- and serum starvation-induced neuronal differentiation. These results indicate that DGK isozymes utilize a variety of DG molecular species derived from PI turnover-independent pathways as substrates in different stimuli and cells. DGK isozymes phosphorylate various DG species to generate various PA species. It was revealed that the modes of activation of conventional and novel protein kinase isoforms by DG molecular species varied considerably. However, PA species-selective binding proteins have not been found to date. Therefore, we next attempted to identify PA species-selective binding proteins from the mouse brain and identified α-synuclein, which has causal links to Parkinson's disease. Intriguingly, we determined that among phospholipids, including several PA species (16:0/16:0-PA, 16:0/18:1-PA, 18:1/18:1-PA, 18:0/18:0-PA and 18:0/20:4-PA); 18:1/18:1-PA was the most strongly bound PA to α-synuclein. Moreover, 18:1/18:1-PA strongly enhanced secondary structural changes from the random coil form to the α-helix form and generated a multimeric and proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein protein. In contrast with the dogma described above, our recent studies strongly suggest that PI turnover-derived DG species and also various DG species derived from PI turnover-independent pathways are utilized by DGK isozymes. DG species supplied from distinct pathways may be utilized by DGK isozymes based on different stimuli present in different types of cells, and individual PA molecular species would have specific targets and exert their own physiological functions."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Several studies have revealed that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) can mediate phosphorylation of steroid receptors at multiple sites, including serine 81 of the androgen receptor (AR)", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the function of a protein kinase?", "id": "5e4f2aeb6d0a277941000032_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Several studies have revealed that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) can mediate phosphorylation of steroid receptors at multiple sites, including serine 81 of the androgen receptor (AR).

We investigated the selectivity of commercially available CDK inhibitors and identified compounds that will be suitable for further studies to identify the CDKs responsible for S81-AR phosphorylation.

The Spearman rank correlation coefficient of the total eFACE and Sunnybrook FGS was 0.75 (r < 0.0001). For the static scores, the correlation coefficient was -0.71 (r < 0.0001). The correlation coefficients for the dynamic and synkinesis scores were 0.77 (r < 0.0001) and -0.78 (r < 0.0001), respectively.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is moderately good agreement between the Sunnybrook FGS and the eFACE. Given the ease of using the eFACE on mobile devices, as well as its additional functionality, it may represent a reasonable facial grading option across disciplines in the future.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We found this dimerization region to have sequence similarity to PDZ domains, which have been previously shown to be involved in signaling by conferring protein-protein interactions.", "answer_start": 963}], "question": "What is the function of the PDZ domain in SATB1?", "id": "5d36b5087bc3fee31f000008_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "SATB1 is expressed primarily in thymocytes and orchestrates temporal and spatial expression of a large number of genes in the T-cell lineage. SATB1 binds to the bases of chromatin loop domains in vivo, recognizing a special DNA context with strong base-unpairing propensity. The majority of thymocytes are eliminated by apoptosis due to selection processes in the thymus. We investigated the fate of SATB1 during thymocyte and T-cell apoptosis. Here we show that SATB1 is specifically cleaved by a caspase 6-like protease at amino acid position 254 to produce a 65-kDa major fragment containing both a base-unpairing region (BUR)-binding domain and a homeodomain. We found that this cleavage separates the DNA-binding domains from amino acids 90 to 204, a region which we show to be a dimerization domain. The resulting SATB1 monomer loses its BUR-binding activity, despite containing both its DNA-binding domains, and rapidly dissociates from chromatin in vivo. We found this dimerization region to have sequence similarity to PDZ domains, which have been previously shown to be involved in signaling by conferring protein-protein interactions. SATB1 cleavage during Jurkat T-cell apoptosis induced by an anti-Fas antibody occurs concomitantly with the high-molecular-weight fragmentation of chromatin of ~50-kb fragments. Our results suggest that mechanisms of nuclear degradation early in apoptotic T cells involve efficient removal of SATB1 by disrupting its dimerization and cleavage of genomic DNA into loop domains to ensure rapid and efficient disassembly of higher-order chromatin structure."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Binding studies using HD-lacking SATB1 and binding target with increased spacer between the two half-sites led us to propose a model for SATB1-DNA complex in which the HDs bind in an antiparallel fashion to the palindromic consensus element via minor groove, bridged by the PDZ-like dimerization domain", "answer_start": 676}], "question": "What is the function of the PDZ domain in SATB1?", "id": "5d36b5087bc3fee31f000008_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "To better understand DNA recognition and transcription activity by SATB1, the T-lineage-enriched chromatin organizer and transcription factor, we have determined its optimal DNA-binding sequence by random oligonucleotide selection. The consensus SATB1-binding sequence (CSBS) comprises a palindromic sequence in which two identical AT-rich half-sites are arranged as inverted repeats flanking a central cytosine or guanine. Strikingly, the CSBS half-site is identical to the conserved element 'TAATA' bound by the known homeodomains (HDs). Furthermore, we show that the high-affinity binding of SATB1 to DNA is dimerization-dependent and the HD also binds in similar fashion. Binding studies using HD-lacking SATB1 and binding target with increased spacer between the two half-sites led us to propose a model for SATB1-DNA complex in which the HDs bind in an antiparallel fashion to the palindromic consensus element via minor groove, bridged by the PDZ-like dimerization domain. CSBS-driven in vivo reporter analysis indicated that SATB1 acts as a repressor upon binding to the CSBS and most of its derivatives and the extent of repression is proportional to SATB1's binding affinity to these sequences. These studies provide mechanistic insights into the mode of DNA binding and its effect on the regulation of transcription by SATB1."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "These studies clearly demonstrated the role of PDZ domain of SATB1 in global gene regulation presumably through its interaction with other cellular proteins.", "answer_start": 1614}], "question": "What is the function of the PDZ domain in SATB1?", "id": "5d36b5087bc3fee31f000008_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The special AT-rich DNA-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a matrix attachment region (MAR)-binding protein that acts as a global repressor via recruitment of CtBP1:HDAC1-containing co-repressors to its binding targets. The N-terminal PSD95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ)-like domain of SATB1 mediates interactions with several chromatin proteins. In the present study, we set out to address whether the PDZ-domain-mediated interactions of SATB1 are critical for its in vivo function as a global repressor. We reasoned that since the N-terminal PDZ-like domain (amino acid residues 1-204) lacks DNA binding activity, it would fail to recruit the interacting partners of SATB1 to its genomic binding sites and hence would not repress the SATB1-regulated genes. Indeed, in vivo MAR-linked luciferase reporter assay revealed that overexpression of the PDZ-like domain resulted in de-repression, indicating that the PDZ-like domain exerts a dominant negative effect on genes regulated by SATB1. Next, we developed a stable dominant negative model in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells that conditionally expressed the N-terminal 1-204 region harbouring the PDZ-like domain of SATB1. To monitor the effect of sequestration of the interaction partners on the global gene regulation by SATB1, transcripts from the induced and uninduced clones were subjected to gene expression profiling. Clustering of expression data revealed that 600 out of 19000 genes analysed were significantly upregulated upon overexpression of the PDZ-like domain. Induced genes were found to be involved in important signalling cascades and cellular functions. These studies clearly demonstrated the role of PDZ domain of SATB1 in global gene regulation presumably through its interaction with other cellular proteins."}]}]}
