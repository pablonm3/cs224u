The most known genes in these islands are cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene (VacA). Most studies demonstrated various frequency of CagA and VacA in patient with peptic ulcer or gastritis in different countries. This variation in CagA and VacA frequency may be due to the capability of this bacterium to be genetically versatile and can alter the expression of these genes with geographic diversity.

Spiral-shaped H. pylori undergo morphologic conversion to a viable but not culturable coccoid form when they transit from the microaerobic stomach into the anaerobic intestinal tract. However, little is known about the morphological and pathogenic characteristics of H. pylori under prolonged anaerobic conditions. In this study, scanning electron microscopy was used to document anaerobiosis-induced morphological changes of H. pylori, from helical to coccoid to a newly defined fragmented form. Western blot analysis indicated that all three forms express certain pathogenic proteins, including the bacterial cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), components of the cag-Type IV secretion system (TFSS), the blood group antigen-binding adhesin BabA, and UreA (an apoenzyme of urease), almost equally. Similar urease activities were also detected in all three forms of H. pylori. However, in contrast to the helical form, bacterial motility and TFSS activity were found to have been abrogated in the anaerobiosis-induced coccoid and fragmented forms of H. pylori.

CagY is an ortholog of VirB10 that, unlike other VirB10 orthologs, has a large middle repeat region (MRR) with extensive repetitive sequence motifs, which undergo CD4+ T cell-dependent recombination during infection of mice. Recombination in the CagY MRR reduces T4SS function, diminishes the host inflammatory response, and enables the bacteria to colonize at a higher density. Since CagY is known to bind human α5β1 integrin, we tested the hypothesis that recombination in the CagY MRR regulates T4SS function by modulating binding to α5β1 integrin. Using a cell-free microfluidic assay, we found that H. pylori binding to α5β1 integrin under shear flow is dependent on the CagY MRR, but independent of the presence of the T4SS pili, which are only formed when H. pylori is in contact with host cells. Similarly, expression of CagY in the absence of other T4SS genes was necessary and sufficient for whole bacterial cell binding to α5β1 integrin. Bacteria with variant cagY alleles that reduced T4SS function showed comparable reduction in binding to α5β1 integrin, although CagY was still expressed on the bacterial surface. We speculate that cagY-dependent modulation of H. pylori T4SS function is mediated by alterations in binding to α5β1 integrin, which in turn regulates the host inflammatory response so as to maximize persistent infection.IMPORTANCE Infection with H. pylori can cause peptic ulcers and is the most important risk factor for gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The major H. pylori virulence factor that determines whether infection causes disease or asymptomatic colonization is the type IV secretion system (T4SS), a sort of molecular syringe that injects bacterial products into gastric epithelial cells and alters host cell physiology. We previously showed that recombination in CagY, an essential T4SS component, modulates the function of the T4SS. Here we found that these recombination events produce parallel changes in specific binding to α5β1 integrin, a host cell receptor that is essential for T4SS-dependent translocation of bacterial effectors. We propose that CagY-dependent binding to α5β1 integrin acts like a molecular rheostat that alters T4SS function and modulates the host immune response to promote persistent infection."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " The proband had normal molecular analysis of the glypican 6 gene (GPC6), which was recently reported as a candidate for autosomal recessive omodysplasia", "answer_start": 215}], "question": "What rare disease is associated with a mutation in the GPC6 gene on chromosome 13?", "id": "5e3da25848dab47f26000004_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "We report on the natural history of a female with dominant omodysplasia, a rare osteochondrodysplasia with short stature, rhizomelia of the extremities (upper extremities more affected), and short first metacarpals.

In patients with WG, high expression of PR3 on the surface of nonprimed neutrophils is associated with an increased incidence and rate of relapse. In this study, we analyzed the functional significance of constitutive PR3 expression for neutrophil activation as induced by anti-PR3 antibody. Therefore, primed and nonprimed neutrophils were stimulated with the monoclonal anti-PR3 antibody PR3G-3. Activation was measured as actin polymerization by the phalloidin assay as an early, detectable activation event and oxidative burst by the dihydrorhodamine assay, as a late, detectable activation event. In contrast to the oxidative burst, we found that anti-PR3 antibody-induced actin polymerization could be triggered in neutrophils without priming with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In addition, a correlation was found between the level of PR3 expression on the surface of these nonprimed neutrophils and the degree of actin polymerization. However, after priming with TNF-alpha, no correlation was found between membrane expression of PR3 and the level of actin polymerization or respiratory burst as induced by anti-PR3 antibody. These data suggest that the presence of PR3 on the surface of nonprimed neutrophils has consequences for their susceptibility to the initial activation step by anti-PR3 antibodies.

Recent studies have shown that membrane-bound PR3 (mPR3) is differentially expressed and colocalizes with CD177/NB1 on circulating neutrophils. We undertook this study to assess the differential expression of CD177 on neutrophils from patients with ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis (ASV) in comparison with patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and healthy individuals, and to investigate whether colocalization of mPR3 and CD177 affects anti-PR3-mediated neutrophil activation.METHODS: Expression of CD177 and mPR3 was analyzed by flow cytometry on isolated neutrophils from patients with ASV (n=53), those with SLE (n=30), those with RA (n=26), and healthy controls (n=31). Neutrophil activation mediated by anti-PR3 antibodies was assessed by measuring the oxidative burst with a dihydrorhodamine assay.RESULTS: Percentages of CD177-expressing neutrophils were significantly higher in patients with ASV and those with SLE than in healthy controls. In 3 healthy donors, CD177 expression was not detected. After priming with tumor necrosis factor alpha, neutrophils remained negative for CD177 while mPR3 expression was induced. Neutrophils from CD177-negative donors or CD177- neutrophils sorted from donors with bimodal expression were susceptible to anti-PR3-mediated oxidative burst. Variation in the extent of anti-PR3-mediated neutrophil activation among different donors occurred independent of the percentage of CD177-expressing neutrophils.CONCLUSION: Membrane expression of CD177 on circulating neutrophils is increased in patients with ASV and in those with SLE, but not in RA patients. However, primed neutrophils from CD177-negative individuals also express mPR3 and are susceptible to anti-PR3-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting that recruitment of CD177-independent mPR3 is involved in anti-PR3-induced neutrophil activation."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The dihydrorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometry assay is a useful diagnostic tool for CGD that can detect absent or reduced NADPH oxidase activity in stimulated phagocytes.", "answer_start": 473}], "question": "What is the purpose of the 123 dihydrorhodamine assay?", "id": "5d387aa8a1e159510500000f_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare genetic disease, which is caused by defects in the NADPH oxidase complex (gp91(phox), p22(phox), p40(phox), p47(phox), and p67(phox)) of phagocytes.

We have previously reported that PDT induces apoptotic cell death in glioma cells when the photosensitizer talaporfin sodium (NPe6) is used. Here, we investigated the combined effect of NPe6-PDT with temozolomide, a DNA-alkylating drug used in glioma therapy.METHODS: Human glioblastoma T98G cells and human glioma U251 cells were used as glioma cells. Cell viability was evaluated by WST-8 assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by measurement of caspase-3 activity and DNA-fragmentation. Intracellular reactive oxygen species were evaluated by dihydrorhodamine assay.RESULTS: While the degree of NPe6-PDT induced cell death unchanged in T98G and U251 cells when temozolomide treatment was adjuvant, it was dose-dependently increased by concomitant treatment with temozolomide. Further, concomitantly administered temozolomide dose-dependently increased caspase-3 activity and DNA-fragmentation, while adjuvant-temozolomide did not. These results are suggesting that concomitantly administered temozolomide potentiates the effect of NPe6-PDT to facilitate apoptotic cell death. Additionally, concomitantly administered temozolomide increased intracellular NPe6-fluorescence and reactive oxygen species, suggesting that the augmentation effect of combined treatment may be due to increased intracellular accumulation of NPe6.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that concomitant treatment with NPe6-PDT and temozolomide is a potentially useful therapy for glioma.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is inherited in either X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive pattern. Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus species are the most common organisms reported. Infections with Burkholderia, Serratia, and Nocardia warrant a screen for CGD. Suppurative lymphadenitis, cutaneous abscesses, pneumonia and diarrhea constitute the most common problems in children with CGD.

Here, we describe the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib and its active metabolite in healthy volunteers and the use of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation to support dose selection for phase IIB in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.METHODS: Two trials were conducted in healthy male volunteers. In the first trial, filgotinib was administered as single doses from 10 mg up to multiple daily doses of 200 mg. In the second trial, daily doses of 300 and 450 mg for 10 days were evaluated. Non-compartmental analysis was used to determine individual pharmacokinetic parameters for filgotinib and its metabolite. The overall pharmacodynamic activity for the two moieties was assessed in whole blood using interleukin-6-induced phosphorylation of signal-transducer and activator of transcription 1 as a biomarker for JAK1 activity. These data were used to conduct non-linear mixed-effects modeling to investigate a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship.RESULTS: Modeling and simulation on the basis of early clinical data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib are dose proportional up to 200 mg, in agreement with observed data, and support that both filgotinib and its metabolite contribute to its pharmacodynamic effects.

We undertook this study to test our hypothesis that selective inhibition of JAK-1 would combine good efficacy with a better safety profile compared with less selective JAK inhibitors.METHODS: In two 4-week exploratory, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa trials, 127 RA patients with an insufficient response to methotrexate (MTX) received filgotinib (GLPG0634, GS-6034) oral capsules (100 mg twice daily or 30, 75, 150, 200, or 300 mg once daily) or placebo, added onto a stable regimen of MTX, to evaluate safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of filgotinib. The primary efficacy end point was the number and percentage of patients in each treatment group meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) at week 4.RESULTS: Treatment with filgotinib at 75-300 mg met the primary end point and showed early onset of efficacy. ACR20 response rates progressively increased to week 4, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein (CRP) level decreased. Marked and sustained improvements were observed in serum CRP level and other PD markers. The PK of filgotinib and its major metabolite was dose proportional over the 30-300 mg range. Early side effects seen with other less selective JAK inhibitors were not observed (e.g., there was no worsening of anemia [JAK-2 inhibition related], no effects on liver transaminases, and no increase in low-density lipoprotein or total cholesterol). A limited decrease in neutrophils without neutropenia was consistent with immunomodulatory effects through JAK-1 inhibition. There were no infections. Overall, filgotinib was well tolerated. Events related to study drug were mild or moderate and transient during therapy, and the most common such event was nausea.CONCLUSION: Selective inhibition of JAK-1 with filgotinib shows initial efficacy in RA with an encouraging safety profile in these exploratory studies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01384422 NCT01668641.© 2017 The Authors.

The impact of RI was investigated in three groups of subjects with mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 6) and severe (n = 3) RI [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60-89, 30-59 and 15-29 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 , respectively] and a control group (n = 9) with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ).

However, only a small subset of potentially druggable targets has attracted significant research and development resources. The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project develops resources to catalyze the development of likely targetable, yet currently understudied prospective drug targets. A central component of the IDG program is a comprehensive knowledge resource of the druggable genome.RESULTS: As part of that effort, we have developed a framework to integrate, navigate, and analyze drug discovery data based on formalized and standardized classifications and annotations of druggable protein targets, the Drug Target Ontology (DTO). DTO was constructed by extensive curation and consolidation of various resources. DTO classifies the four major drug target protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors, based on phylogenecity, function, target development level, disease association, tissue expression, chemical ligand and substrate characteristics, and target-family specific characteristics. The formal ontology was built using a new software tool to auto-generate most axioms from a database while supporting manual knowledge acquisition. A modular, hierarchical implementation facilitate ontology development and maintenance and makes use of various external ontologies, thus integrating the DTO into the ecosystem of biomedical ontologies. As a formal OWL-DL ontology, DTO contains asserted and inferred axioms. Modeling data from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target disease relationships.CONCLUSIONS: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene, protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models, drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug discovery. The first version of DTO is publically available via the website http://drugtargetontology.org/ , Github ( http://github.com/DrugTargetOntology/DTO ), and the NCBO Bioportal ( http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DTO ).

Early macroscopic changes are seen in the striatum with involvement of the cortex as the disease progresses. There are currently no disease modifying treatments; therefore supportive and symptomatic management is the mainstay of treatment. In recent years there have been significant advances in understanding both the cellular pathology and the macroscopic structural brain changes that occur as the disease progresses.

Experimental studies have revealed that the combination of nilotinib and ABL-001 induced a 'bent' conformation in the C-terminal helix of Bcr-Abl; a benchmark of inhibition, thereby exhibiting a greater potency in the treatment of CML, surmounting the setbacks of drug resistance, disease regression and relapse. Therefore, we report the first account of the dynamics and conformational analysis of oncogenic T334I Bcr-Abl by dual targeting. Our findings revealed that unlike in the Bcr-Abl-Nilotinib complex, dual targeting by both inhibitors induced the bent conformation in the C-terminal helix that varied with time. This was coupled with significant alteration in Bcr-Abl stability, flexibility, and compactness and an overall structural re-orientation inwards towards the hydrophobic core, which reduced the solvent-exposed residues indicative of protein folding. This study will facilitate allosteric targeting and the design of more potent allosteric inhibitors for resistive target proteins in cancer."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Asciminib (previously ABL001), which binds the myristate-binding pocket of the Bcr-Abl kinase domain, is in phase I clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib for the treatment of patients with refractory CML or Ph+ ALL.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Which molecule is targeted by Asciminib?", "id": "5e30e80bfbd6abf43b00003b_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Asciminib (previously ABL001), which binds the myristate-binding pocket of the Bcr-Abl kinase domain, is in phase I clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib for the treatment of patients with refractory CML or Ph+ ALL.

Moreover, the computational analysis of the 3'UTR region showed that six of the eight variants located in this region affected the Wild Type (WT) pattern of the miRNA targets sites and/or their proper display. The 26 sSNPs retained as putatively functional possessed a very low allele frequency, supporting their pathogenicity.

Defective ABCB4 gene expression and protein function result in various cholestatic liver and bile duct injuries. Thyroid hormone receptor (THR) is a major regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism; we explored its potential role in ABCB4 regulation. Thyroid hormone T3 stimulation to human hepatocyte models showed direct transcriptional activation of ABCB4 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To determine whether THRβ1 (the main THR isoform of the liver) is involved in regulation, we tested THRβ1-specific agonists (e.g., GC-1, KB-141); these agonists resulted in greater stimulation than the native hormone. KB-141 activated hepatic ABCB44 expression in mice, which enhanced biliary PC secretion in vivo. We also identified THR response elements 6 kb upstream of the ABCB4 locus that were conserved in humans and mice. Thus, T3-via THRβ1 as a novel transcriptional activator regulates ABCB4 to increase ABCB4 protein levels at the canalicular membrane and promote PC secretion into bile. These findings may have important implications for understanding thyroid hormone function as a potential modifier of bile duct homeostasis and provide pharmacologic opportunities to improve liver function in hepatobiliary diseases caused by low ABCB4 expression."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome is predicted to encode 14 functional open reading frames, leading to the expression of up to 30 structural and non-structural protein products.

The initial diagnosis of SARS was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. During the outbreak, molecular and serologic tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) became available. However, without a \"gold standard,\" it was impossible to determine the usefulness of these tests. We describe how these tests were used during the first phase of the SARS outbreak in Toronto and offer some recommendations that may be useful if SARS returns.METHODS: We examined the results of all diagnostic laboratory tests used in 117 patients admitted to hospitals in Toronto who met the Health Canada criteria for suspect or probable SARS. Focusing on tests for SARS-CoV, we attempted to determine the optimal specimen types and timing of specimen collection.RESULTS: Diagnostic test results for SARS-CoV were available for 110 of the 117 patients. SARS-CoV was detected by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in at least one specimen in 59 (54.1%) of 109 patients. Serologic test results of convalescent samples were positive in 50 (96.2%) of 52 patients for whom paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. Of the 110 patients, 78 (70.9%) had specimens that tested positive by means of RT-PCR, serologic testing or both methods. The proportion of RT-PCR test results that were positive was similar between patients who met the criteria for suspect SARS (50.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.4%-63.2%) and those who met the criteria for probable SARS (58.0%, 95% CI 44.2%-70.7%).

As tests for SARS-CoV continue to be optimized, evaluation of the clinical presentation and elucidation of a contact history must remain the cornerstone of SARS diagnosis.

Inhibitors selective for the BRAFV600E oncoprotein, the most common BRAF mutant, elicit only poor response rates in BRAF-mutant CRC as single agents. This unresponsiveness was mechanistically attributed to the loss of negative feedbacks on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and initiated clinical trials that combine BRAF (and MEK) inhibitors, either singly or in combination, with the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab. First results of these combinatorial studies demonstrated improved efficacy, however, the response rates still were heterogeneous. Here, we show that BRAF inhibition leads to the upregulation of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in CRC cell lines, including not only the EGFR, but also human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER3. Importantly, combination of the BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) vemurafenib (PLX4032), dabrafenib, or encorafenib with inhibitors dually targeting the EGFR and HER2 (such as lapatinib, canertinib, and afatinib) significantly reduced the metabolic activity and proliferative potential of CRC cells.

Interestingly, BRAF inhibitors did not only upregulate RTKs, but also increased the abundance of the GRB2-associated binders (Gab) 1 and Gab2, two important amplifiers of RTK signaling. An allele-specific shRNA-mediated knockdown of BRAFV600E revealed that Gab2 upregulation was directly dependent on the loss of the oncoprotein and was not caused by an \"off-target\" effect of these kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, Gab2 and Gab2-mediated Shp2 signaling were shown to be functionally important in BRAFi resistance.

This often occurs in response to injury or inflammation, leading to joint immobilization and significant disability. There are currently no definitive treatment options for this devastating disease. Although the most dramatic phenotype in FOP is the episodic and progressive heterotopic ossification, patients report a number of symptoms that affect other organ systems. Post-mortem examination of FOP patients may contribute to our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and complications of this disease. Here, we present the autopsy findings from three patients with FOP.FINDINGS: Autopsy findings in two of the three patients confirmed that the cause of death was cardiorespiratory failure in the setting of severe thoracic insufficiency from heterotopic ossification. Both of these patients also had evidence of right ventricular dilatation likely secondary to thoracic insufficiency. The third patient died from complications of a traumatic head injury after a fall but also had post-mortem evidence of thoracic insufficiency syndrome. All three patients had extensive, widespread heterotopic ossification and joint deformities consistent with FOP. There was extensive ossification of the spinal ligament in these patients, which may contribute to cervical spine rigidity. One patient was diagnosed post-mortem with a brainstem malformation. No additional significant abnormalities were noted in the other organ systems. Finally, we also demonstrate that cadaveric skin fibroblasts can be isolated for use as a potential source for future in vitro cell culture studies.CONCLUSIONS: This autopsy case series provides valuable information about the underlying complications of FOP and contributes significantly to our knowledge of this rare yet debilitating disorder. Thoracic insufficiency syndrome, right heart dysfunction, widespread heterotopic ossification, spinal ligament ossification, and CNS malformations were clearly evident; however, most other non-bone tissues appeared to be spared from gross malformations. Finally, the ability to isolate live cells from cadaveric skin is an important technique that will facilitate future studies, particularly as induced pluripotent stem cells and other cell-based technologies evolve. This case series highlights the importance of post-mortem examinations and their contribution to our current knowledge of disease pathophysiology and comorbidities.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To better ascertain the frequency and characteristics of osteocartilaginous exostoses in FOP disease, we conducted a cross-sectional radiological study based on all the traceable cases identified in a previous comprehensive national research. Metaphyseal exostoses were present in all the 17 cases of FOP studied. Although most often arising from the distal femoral (where metaphyseal exostoses adopt a peculiar not yet reported appearance) and proximal tibial bones, we have found that they are not restricted to these areas, but rather can be seen scattered at a variety of other skeletal sites. Using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, we show that these exophytic outgrowths are true osteochondromas. As a whole, these results are in agreement with data coming from the literature review. Our study confirms the presence of metaphyseal osteochondromas as a very frequent trait of FOP phenotype and an outstanding feature of its anomalous skeletal developmental component. In line with recent evidences, this might imply that dysregulation of BMP signaling, in addition to promoting exuberant heterotopic ossification, could induce aberrant chondrogenesis and osteochondroma formation.

In this disease, HO can occur in discrete flares, often triggered by injury or inflammation, or may progress incrementally without identified triggers. Mice harboring an Acvr1R206H knock-in allele recapitulate the phenotypic spectrum of FOP, including injury-responsive intramuscular HO and spontaneous articular, tendon, and ligament ossification. The cells that drive HO in these diverse tissues can be compartmentalized into two lineages: an Scx+ tendon-derived progenitor that mediates endochondral HO of ligaments and joints without exogenous injury, and a muscle-resident interstitial Mx1+ population that mediates intramuscular, injury-dependent endochondral HO. Expression of Acvr1R206H in either lineage confers aberrant gain of BMP signaling and chondrogenic differentiation in response to activin A and gives rise to mutation-expressing hypertrophic chondrocytes in HO lesions. Compared to Acvr1R206H, expression of the man-made, ligand-independent ACVR1Q207D mutation accelerates and increases the penetrance of all observed phenotypes, but does not abrogate the need for antecedent injury in muscle HO, demonstrating the need for an injury factor in addition to enhanced BMP signaling. Both injury-dependent intramuscular and spontaneous ligament HO in Acvr1R206H knock-in mice were effectively controlled by the selective ACVR1 inhibitor LDN-212854. Thus, diverse phenotypes of HO found in FOP are rooted in cell-autonomous effects of dysregulated ACVR1 signaling in nonoverlapping tissue-resident progenitor pools that may be addressed by systemic therapy or by modulating injury-mediated factors involved in their local recruitment."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "dystopia canthorum (lateral displacement of the inner canthi).", "answer_start": 200}], "question": "What is dystopia canthorum?", "id": "5e361c8792b3349b55000001_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Waardenburg syndrome (WS) type I is a non-progressive auditory-pigmentary disorder comprising congenital sensorineural hearing loss and pigmentary disturbances of the iris, hair, and skin, along with dystopia canthorum (lateral displacement of the inner canthi).

These domains show an intricate CBX1 binding pattern: While CBX1 is globally elevated throughout the domains, it is absent from the promoters and binds more strongly to the 3' ends of KRAB-ZNF genes. KRAB-ZNF domains contain large numbers of LINE elements, which may contribute to CBX1 recruitment.
