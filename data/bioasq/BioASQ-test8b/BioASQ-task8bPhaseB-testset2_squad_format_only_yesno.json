Blood was collected at four time points after the second vaccination for plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) (primary endpoint) and ELISA (secondary endpoint) antibody assays. For each subject, the peak PRNT (or ELISA) titer was defined by the highest PRNT (or ELISA) titer among all available measurements post second vaccination. Non-inferiority of a non-standard arm compared to the standard arm was met if the upper limit of the 98.33% confidence interval of the difference in the mean log2 peak titers between the standard and non-standard arm was less than 1.RESULTS: Non-inferiority of the PRNT antibody response was not established for any of the three non-standard study arms. Non-inferiority of the ELISA antibody response was established for the Day 1 and 22 compressed schedule and for administration by JI. Solicited local reactions, such as redness and swelling, tended to be more commonly reported with JI administration. Four post-vaccination hypersensitivity reactions were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluations of the primary endpoint of PRNT antibody responses do not support alternative strategies of administering MVA vaccine by S&N on compressed schedules or administration by JI on the standard schedule.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01827371.Copyright © 2017.

This study compared the safety and immunogenicity of the standard formulation, dose and route with both a more stable, lyophilized formulation and with an antigen-sparing intradermal (ID) route of administration.METHODS: 524 subjects were randomized to receive either a full dose of Lyophilized-SC, a full dose of Liquid-SC or 20% (2×10(7) TCID50 in 0.1mL) of a full dose Liquid-ID MVA on Days 0 and 28. Safety and immunogenicity were followed through 180 days post second vaccination.RESULTS: Among the 3 groups, the proportion of subjects with moderate/severe functional local reactions was significantly different (P=0.0013) between the Lyophilized-SC group (30.3%), the Liquid-SC group (13.8%) and Liquid-ID group (22.0%) only after first vaccination; and for moderate/severe measured erythema and/or induration after any vaccination (P=0.0001) between the Lyophilized-SC group (58.2%), the Liquid-SC group (58.1%) and the Liquid-ID group (94.8%) and the reactions lasted longer in the Liquid-ID group. In the ID Group, 36.1% of subjects had mild injection site skin discoloration lasting ≥6 months. After second vaccination Day (42-208), geometric mean of peak neutralization titers were 87.8, 49.5 and 59.5 for the Lyophilized-SC, Liquid-SC and Liquid-ID groups, respectively, and the maximum number of responders based on peak titer in each group was 142/145 (97.9%), 142/149 (95.3%) and 138/146 (94.5%), respectively. At 180 days after the second vaccination, geometric mean neutralization titers declined to 11.7, 10.2 and 10.4 with only 54.3%, 39.2% and 35.2% of subjects remaining seropositive for the Lyophilized-SC, Liquid-SC and Liquid-ID groups, respectively. Both the Lyophilized-SC and Liquid-ID groups were considered non-inferior (primary objective) to the Liquid-SC group.CONCLUSIONS: Transitioning to a lyophilized formulation, which has a longer shelf life, will not negatively impact immunogenicity.

In vivo SATB1-binding sequences hybridized to genomic DNA as single spots within the residual nucleus circumscribed by the halo of DNA and remained as single spots in the nuclear matrix, indicating that these sequences are localized at the base of chromatin loops.

SATB1 expression profiles were evaluated in well-differentiated NPC cell line CNE1, poorly-differentiated CNE2Z, undifferentiated C666-1 and immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelia NP-69 cells using quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting and fluorescent staining. After inhibition the SATB1 expression by using SATB1 specific small interfering RNA in these cell lines, the change of cell proliferation was investigated by western blotting analysis of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) expression and CCK-8 assay, and the cell migration was assessed by Transwell migration assay. Finally, the expressions of SATB1 and PCNA were examined in CNE1 cells that forced LMP-1 expression by fluorescent staining and RT-PCR.RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SATB1 protein expression was elevated in NPC tissues compared to benign nasopharyngeal tissues (P = 0.005). Moreover, high levels of SATB1 protein expression were positively correlated with clinical stage (P = 0.025), the status of lymph node metastasis (N classification) (P = 0.018), distant metastasis (M classification) (P = 0.041) and LMP-1 expression status (r = 2.35, P < 0.01) in NPC patients.

Targeted knockdown of SATB1 expression obviously attenuated the proliferation and migration of highly SATB1-expressing CNE2Z and C666-1 cells, but not NP-69 and CNE1 cells. Interestingly, forced LMP-1 expression in CNE1 cells led to a surprisingly increasing SATB1 expression and nuclear location, companying with an up-regulated PCNA expression.CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that EBV LMP-1-mediated over-expression of SATB1 is associated with NPC progression, suggesting SATB1 may represent a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for NPC."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a cell type-specific matrix attachment region binding protein, functioning as a global genome organizer.

SATB1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and scored by two independent investigators. SATB1 expression was predominantly nuclear in both normal and cancer tissues. Loss of SATB1 nuclear expression was seen in 22% of colorectal cancers compared to 1.5% of adjacent normal colorectal tissue, and was associated with worse overall survival (P = 0.02) independent of age and stage of disease (HR 2.48 with 95% CI 1.31-4.70). Loss of SATB1 expression was more evident in younger patients (P = 0.03), tumours with mucinous or signet ring histology (P = 0.0001) and poor differentiation (P = 0.005). SATB1 expression was associated with a survival advantage in patients with Dukes C tumours who received adjuvant chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: Loss of SATB1 nuclear expression correlates with poor survival and a less favourable response to adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.

Overexpression has been found in various solid tumors and positively correlated with prognostic and clinicopathological properties. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SATB1 overexpression and its correlation with poor differentiation, invasive depth, TNM (tumor, nodes, metastases) stage and prognosis have been demonstrated. However, more detailed studies on the SATB1 functions in CRC are warranted. In this article, we comprehensively analyze the cellular and molecular role of SATB1 in CRC cell lines with different SATB1 expression levels by using RNAi-mediated knockdown. Using siRNAs with different knockdown efficacies, we demonstrate antiproliferative, cell cycle-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of SATB1 knockdown in a SATB1 gene dose-dependent manner. Tumor growth inhibition is confirmed in vivo in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model using stable knockdown cells. The in-depth analysis of cellular effects reveals increased activities of caspases-3, -7, -8, -9 and other mediators of apoptotic pathways. Similarly, the analysis of E- and N-cadherin, slug, twist, β-catenin and MMP7 indicates SATB1 effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and matrix breakdown. Our results also establish SATB1 effects on receptor tyrosine kinases and (proto-)oncogenes such as HER receptors and Pim-1. Taken together, this suggests a more complex molecular interplay between tumor-promoting and possible inhibitory effects in CRC by affecting multiple pathways and molecules involved in proliferation, cell cycle, EMT, invasion and cell survival."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The Special AT-rich Sequence Binding Protein 1 (SATB1) exerts multiple functions, by influencing the structural organization of chromatin and interacting with several co-activators and co-repressors of transcription.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Is SATB1 positioned close to AT-rich sequences?", "id": "5d38826ea1e1595105000016_012", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The Special AT-rich Sequence Binding Protein 1 (SATB1) exerts multiple functions, by influencing the structural organization of chromatin and interacting with several co-activators and co-repressors of transcription.

More recently, SATB1 has been connected with solid tumors, tumorigenesis, tumor progression and tumor immunity. On the diagnostic side, SATB1 levels were found to correlate with clinicopathological features like increased TNM stage, reduced tumor differentiation, and a shorter overall survival. SATB1 expression was also identified as an independent prognostic marker in various cancers. Moreover, different gene knockdown or ectopic overexpression strategies in cancer cells have identified SATB1 to affect proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, cell morphology / cell polarity, EMT and multidrug-resistance as well as tumor formation, growth, invasion and metastasis in vivo.

AMPK activity was dose and time dependently downregulated during phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, which was accompanied by an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production. Of note, AMPK activators metformin and AICAR significantly attenuated PMA-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and proinflammatory cytokine production.

On the other hand, inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity inhibited PMA-induced inflammation but not differentiation, suggesting that inflammation and differentiation are independent events. In contrast, inhibition of STAT3 activity inhibited both inflammation and monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. By decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation, metformin and AICAR through increased AMPK activation caused inhibition of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Metformin attenuated Ang-II-induced atheromatous plaque formation and aortic aneurysm in ApoE(-/-) mice partly by reducing monocyte infiltration.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and its inhibition restores the insulin resistance. This study investigated the antitumor effect of metformin on endometrial cancer with a focus on PP2A.METHODS: Metformin (1,500-2,250 mg/day) was preoperatively administered to patients with endometrial cancer for 4 to 6 weeks. Expression of the PP2A regulatory subunits, 4 (PPP2R4) and B (PP2A-B), was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using paired specimens obtained before and after metformin treatment. The effect of PPP2R4 inhibition with small interfering RNA was evaluated in the endometrial cancer cell lines HEC265 and HEC1B. P values of < .05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTS: Preoperative metformin treatment significantly reduced the expression of PP2A-B, as determined using IHC, and the mRNA expression of PPP2R4, as determined using RT-PCR, in the patients with endometrial cancer. However, metformin could not directly alter the PPP2R4 mRNA levels in the endometrial cancer cell lines in vitro. PPP2R4 knockdown reduced the proliferation and induced the apoptosis by activating caspases 3/7 in HEC265 and HEC1B cells.CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of the PP2A-B subunit, including PPP2R4, is an important indirect target of metformin. Inhibition of PP2A may be an option for the treatment of endometrial cancer patients with insulin resistance.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with UMIN-CTR (number UMIN000004852)."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "There is no evidence of antitumor effect of metformin.

The actuarial event-free survival and overall survival rate at 5 years after treatment for a radiation-induced meningioma was 89%. Three patients who underwent resection for retreatment experienced a Grade 3 toxicity.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced meningiomas after treatment of pediatric CNS tumors are effectively managed with single-modality therapy.

We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bilateral, intrastriatal delivery of ProSavin, a lentiviral vector-based gene therapy aimed at restoring local and continuous dopamine production in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.METHODS: We undertook a phase 1/2 open-label trial with 12-month follow-up at two study sites (France and UK) to assess the safety and efficacy of ProSavin after bilateral injection into the putamen of patients with Parkinson's disease. All patients were then enrolled in a separate open-label follow-up study of long-term safety. Three doses were assessed in separate cohorts: low dose (1·9×10(7) transducing units [TU]); mid dose (4·0×10(7) TU); and high dose (1×10(8) TU). Inclusion criteria were age 48-65 years, disease duration 5 years or longer, motor fluctuations, and 50% or higher motor response to oral dopaminergic therapy. The primary endpoints of the phase 1/2 study were the number and severity of adverse events associated with ProSavin and motor responses as assessed with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III (off medication) scores, at 6 months after vector administration. Both trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00627588 and NCT01856439.FINDINGS: 15 patients received ProSavin and were followed up (three at low dose, six mid dose, six high dose). During the first 12 months of follow-up, 54 drug-related adverse events were reported (51 mild, three moderate). Most common were increased on-medication dyskinesias (20 events, 11 patients) and on-off phenomena (12 events, nine patients). No serious adverse events related to the study drug or surgical procedure were reported. A significant improvement in mean UPDRS part III motor scores off medication was recorded in all patients at 6 months (mean score 38 [SD 9] vs 26 [8], n=15, p=0·0001) and 12 months (38 vs 27 [8]; n=15, p=0·0001) compared with baseline.INTERPRETATION: ProSavin was safe and well tolerated in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.

Despite great therapeutic advances, most of the MM patients still relapse and remain incurable. Over the past years, immunotherapy has emerged as a new field in cancer therapy. Here, the immune cells of the patients themselves are activated to target the tumor cells. In MM, several effector cells of the immune system are present in the BM microenvironment; unfortunately, they are mostly all functionally impaired. In this review, we focus on the role of innate-like T cells in MM, particularly CD1d- and MR1- restricted T cells such as respectively invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. These cells have the capacity upon activation to rapidly release copious amounts of cytokines affecting a wide range of innate and adaptive immune responses, and could therefore play a key protective role in anti-tumor immunity. We describe recent observations with regard to functional exhaustion of iNKT and MAIT cells in MM pathology and discuss the potential application of checkpoint inhibition as an attractive target for prolonged activation of these immunomodulatory T cells in the treatment of MM."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) is an unusual but well documented tumor.

Nevertheless, the molecular features remain largely unknown.Objective: To investigate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in a large series of peritoneal mesothelioma and characterize the mutational landscape of these tumors.Design, Setting, and Participants: We studied 88 consecutive patients (39 men, 49 women; median age 61, range 17-84 years) with peritoneal mesotheliomas diagnosed at a single institution between 2005 and 2015. We identified ALK-positive mesotheliomas by immunohistochemistry and confirmed ALK rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In ALK-rearranged cases, we characterized the fusion partners using targeted next-generation sequencing of both tumor DNA and RNA. In select cases, we quantified asbestos fibers by combined scanning electron microscopy and x-ray spectroscopy. We also explored ALK rearrangement in a separate series of 205 patients with pleural mesothelioma.Main Outcomes and Measures: Identification and characterization of novel ALK rearrangements and correlations with clinicopathologic characteristics.Results: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase was positive by immunohistochemistry in 11 (13%) peritoneal mesotheliomas (focal weak in 8, diffuse strong in 3). In focal weak ALK-positive cases, no ALK rearrangement was detected by FISH or next-generation sequencing. In strong diffuse ALK-positive cases, FISH confirmed ALK rearrangements, and next-generation sequencing identified novel fusion partners ATG16L1, STRN, and TPM1. Patients with ALK-rearranged peritoneal mesotheliomas were women and younger than patients without ALK rearrangement (median age 36 vs 62; Mann-Whitney test, P = .02), but all other clinicopathologic characteristics (size of tumor nodules, histology, treatment, and survival) were not different. No asbestos fibers were detected in ALK-rearranged cases. Furthermore, loss of chromosomal region 9p or 22q or genetic alterations in BAP1, SETD2, or NF2 typically present in peritoneal mesothelioma were absent in the ALK-rearranged cases. All pleural mesotheliomas were ALK-negative by immunohistochemistry.Conclusions and Relevance: We identified unique ALK rearrangements in a subset of patients with peritoneal mesothelioma, each lacking asbestos fibers, therapeutic radiation, and cytogenetic and molecular alterations typically found in these tumors. Identification of clinically actionable ALK rearrangements may represent a novel pathogenetic mechanism of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma with promise for targeted therapy."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "According to global estimates, at least 107,000 people die each year from asbestos-related lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis resulting from occupational exposure", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Is mesothelioma caused by asbestos exposure?", "id": "5e31c4adfbd6abf43b00004d_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "According to global estimates, at least 107,000 people die each year from asbestos-related lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis resulting from occupational exposure.

Management of these conditions therefore relies on controlling serum uric acid levels. ATP-binding cassette transporter, sub-family G, member 2 (ABCG2/BCRP) is a well-studied urate transporter expressed on apical membranes in several tissues, including the intestine, liver, and kidney. Here, we discuss the potential of future gout therapies targeting ABCG2. Areas covered: ABCG2 regulates serum uric acid via physiologically important roles in both renal and extra-renal urate excretion. ABCG2 dysfunction, which promotes onset of hyperuricemia, often results in decreased urate excretion through the extra-renal (principally intestinal), rather than the renal pathway. This review covers recent attempts to establish the basis of ABCG2 function according to genetic diathesis, its molecular structure, and the effects of medication. Furthermore, the possibility of treating gout and hyperuricemia by upregulating intestinal ABCG2 expression is examined. Expert opinion: ABCG2 holds great promise as a therapeutic target for these conditions, particularly considering its involvement in extra-renal urate excretion. Manipulation of ABCG2, including controlling the level and location of its expression, has the potential to prevent gout by promoting uric acid excretion as effectively as general uricosuric drugs.ABBREVIATIONS: ATP-binding cassette (ABC), transmembrane domain (TMD), nucleotide binding domain (NBD), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "the discovery that ABCG2 plays a central role on extra-renal uric acid excretion,", "answer_start": 248}], "question": "Is the protein ABCG2 (ATP-Binding Cassette, subfamily G, member 2, transporter) excreting uric acid?", "id": "5e5b5c6fb761aafe0900000a_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Over the last decade, there have been major advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of hyperuricaemia and gout as well as of the pharmacogenetics of urate-lowering therapy.

Translational research involved moving from delineating the relationships between CGRP and primary headaches and the clinical development of anti-CGRP treatments. The first anti-CGRP treatment, an intravenous CGRP-receptor antagonist or gepant, olcegepant, was described as effective in terminating migraines in humans in 2004. Methods - The author briefly reviews some of the pathophysiology and translational research that led to the development of the gepants initially and then subsequently to the anti-CGRP and anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibodies. All accessible randomized controlled trials, abstracts, platform presentations, and press releases on the monoclonal antibody trials are summarized. The trajectory from bench research to the approval of the first anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody for clinical use in migraine prevention, erenumab, is discussed, as well as potential clinical uses of the anti-CGRP treatments. Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018. At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine, galcanezumab and fremanezumab.

Here we generated MSNs from HD patient fibroblasts through microRNA-based direct neuronal conversion, bypassing the induction of pluripotency and retaining age signatures of the original fibroblasts. We found that patient MSNs consistently exhibited mutant HTT (mHTT) aggregates, mHTT-dependent DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and spontaneous degeneration in culture over time. We further provide evidence that erasure of age stored in starting fibroblasts or neuronal conversion of presymptomatic HD patient fibroblasts results in differential manifestation of cellular phenotypes associated with HD, highlighting the importance of age in modeling late-onset neurological disorders."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The patient developed progressive lung fibrosis under several immunosuppressants and was started on nintedanib, with clinical and functional stabilization.

The authors review the evolution of treatment approaches in the ILDs, informed by recent placebo-controlled trials, and discuss current clinical trials in which emerging pathogenetic mechanisms are targeted as novel therapeutic agents.AREAS COVERED: In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), recent randomised, placebo-controlled trials have tested the efficacy of new therapies, and although primary end points have not been met in most, treatment effects have been observed. The demonstration of harmful effects from widely used IPF therapies has been equally important. Pirfenidone and nintedanib are emerging agents that exert pleiotropic effects, reflective of the multiple mechanistic pathways of IPF. Treatment may necessitate a similarly multifaceted approach using combination regimens of antifibrotic and antioxidant agents in order to be effective. In other ILDs, including systemic sclerosis, other connective tissue diseases and pulmonary sarcoidosis, the inflammatory/fibrotic model remains appropriate. Studies in systemic sclerosis have provided 'proof of concept' data for immunosuppressive therapy in the prevention of disease progression but there is a continuing need for controlled clinical trials in the more prevalent ILDs.EXPERT OPINION: In IPF, significant treatment effects have been reported with pirfenidone, nintedanib and N-acetylcysteine. Combinations of these pleiotropic agents, along with future monotherapies, in 'oncological regimens' may hold the key to more effective IPF treatment. In disorders other than IPF, there is an ongoing need for the controlled evaluation of traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies. 'Cohort enrichment' (the selective recruitment of patients most likely to progress) holds the key to the identification of worthwhile treatment benefits."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The SENSCIS™ trial is a randomised, placebo-controlled Phase III trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with SSc-ILD (NCT02597933).", "answer_start": 377}], "question": "Does nintedanib hold promise for lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis?", "id": "5e30f76afbd6abf43b000046_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVES: Nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

These intracellular structures contain intraluminal vesicles that are released from the cell as exosomes when the MVB fuses with the plasma membrane. Here we have investigated the role of exosomes in the processing of APP and show that these vesicles contain APP-CTFs, as well as Abeta. In addition, inhibition of gamma-secretase results in a significant increase in the amount of alpha- and beta-secretase cleavage, further increasing the amount of APP-CTFs contained within these exosomes. We identify several key members of the secretase family of proteases (BACE, PS1, PS2, and ADAM10) to be localized in exosomes, suggesting they may be a previously unidentified site of APP cleavage.

They can transfer information between cells and may cause pathology, for example, a role for exosomes has been proposed in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Although studied in several biofluids, exosomes have not been extensively studied in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from humans. The objective of this study was to determine: 1) whether human CSF contains exosomes and 2) the variability in exosomal protein content across individuals.METHODS: CSF was collected from 5 study participants undergoing thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (around 200 - 500 ml per participant) and low-density membrane vesicles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The presence of exosomes was determined by western blot for marker proteins, isopycnic centrifugation on a sucrose step gradient and transmission electron microscopy with immuno-labelling. Whole protein profiling was performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR).RESULTS: Flotillin 1 and tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), two exosomal marker proteins, were identified in the ultracentrifugation pellet using western blot. These markers localized to a density consistent with exosomes following isopycnic centrifugation. Transmission electron microscopy visualized structures consistent with exosomes in size and appearance that labelled positive for flotillin 1. Therefore, the pellet that resulted from ultracentrifugation of human CSF contained exosomes. FT-ICR profiling of this pellet was performed and 84-161 ions were detected per study participant. Around one third of these ions were only present in a single study participant and one third were detected in all five. With regard to ion quantity, the median coefficient of variation was 81% for ions detected in two or more samples.CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes were identified in human CSF and their proteome is a potential new reservoir for biomarker discovery in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, techniques used to concentrate exosomes from CSF need refinement to reduce variability. In this study we used relatively large starting volumes of human CSF, future studies will focus on exosome isolation from smaller 'real life' clinical samples; a key challenge in the development of exosomes as translational tools."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "expressed exosomal marker tumor susceptibility gene (TSG) 101 and flotillin (Flot) 1.", "answer_start": 574}], "question": "Can Flotillin be used as exosomal marker?", "id": "5e5b93a2752ebcdc7a000003_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles with the function of intercellular communication, and they are released by various cell types.

We compared the activities of wild-type promoters to mutated forms, where we have introduced one or more substitutions to mimic the ancestral state devoid of the GABPa consensus binding sequence. Similarly, we introduced the human-specific substitutions into chimpanzee and macaque promoter backgrounds.

Circulating serum autoantibodies directed against the endocrine cells of the islets of Langerhans (Islet cell autoantibodies - ICAb) are an important hallmark of this disease. Assays for islet cell autoantibodies have facilitated the investigation and understanding of several facets in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. Their applications have extended into clinical practice and have opened new avenues for early preclinical prediction and preventive prophylaxis in IDDM/type 1 DM. Recently, surprisingly, differences in insulin content between T1DM islets, as well as, 'patchy' or 'lobular' destruction of islets have been described. These unique pathobiological phenomena, suggest that beta cell destruction may not always be inexorable and inevitably complete/total, and thus raise hopes for possible therapeutic interruption of beta cell autoimmunity - destruction and cure of type 1 diabetes. \"Recurrent or secondary autoimmune insulitis\" refers to the rapid reappearance of islet cell autoantibodies post pancreas transplant, and selective islet beta cell destruction in the grafted pancreas [never forgetting or \"anamnestic\" beta cell destructive memory], in the absence of any graft pancreas rejection [monozygotic twin to twin transplantation]. The one definite environmental factor is congenital rubella, because of which a subset of children subsequently develop type 1 diabetes. The putative predisposing factors are viruses, gluten and cow's milk. The putative protective factors include gut flora, helminths, viral infections, and Vitamin D. Prevention of T1DM can include: Primary prevention strategies before the development of autoantibodies and Secondary prevention regimens after autoantibody development. Once islet cell autoantibodies have developed, the goal is to establish a therapeutic regimen to preserve at least 90% of the beta cells, and prevent the development of hyperglycaemia. The targets for T1DM reversal should include autoimmunity, beta cell regeneration and protection of beta cell mass.

Interventions tested include several dietary manipulations, including infant formulas free of either cow's milk or of bovine insulin, infant formula supplemented with the omega-3-fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid, delayed introduction of gluten-containing foods, and vitamin D supplementation. Secondary prevention studies have been conducted in both children and adults with diabetes autoantibodies. Interventions tested include nicotinamide, insulin injections, oral insulin, nasal insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and cyclosporine. Underway are secondary prevention studies with teplizumab and with abatacept."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "INTERPRETATION: Findings of exploratory analyses suggest that future studies of immunotherapeutic intervention with teplizumab might have increased success in prevention of a decline in β-cell function (measured by C-peptide) and provision of glycaemic control at reduced doses of insulin if they target patients early after diagnosis of diabetes and children.", "answer_start": 2371}], "question": "Does teplizumab hold promise for diabetes prevention?", "id": "5e30f638fbd6abf43b000045_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Findings of small studies have suggested that short treatments with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies that are mutated to reduce Fc receptor binding preserve β-cell function and decrease insulin needs in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes. In this phase 3 trial, we assessed the safety and efficacy of one such antibody, teplizumab.METHODS: In this 2-year trial, patients aged 8-35 years who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for 12 weeks or fewer were enrolled and treated at 83 clinical centres in North America, Europe, Israel, and India. Participants were allocated (2:1:1:1 ratio) by an interactive telephone system, according to computer-generated block randomisation, to receive one of three regimens of teplizumab infusions (14-day full dose, 14-day low dose, or 6-day full dose) or placebo at baseline and at 26 weeks. The Protégé study is still underway, and patients and study staff remain masked through to study closure. The primary composite outcome was the percentage of patients with insulin use of less than 0·5 U/kg per day and glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1C)) of less than 6·5% at 1 year. Analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00385697.FINDINGS: 763 patients were screened, of whom 516 were randomised to receive 14-day full-dose teplizumab (n=209), 14-day low-dose teplizumab (n=102), 6-day full-dose teplizumab (n=106), or placebo (n=99). Two patients in the 14-day full-dose group and one patient in the placebo group did not start treatment, so 513 patients were eligible for efficacy analyses. The primary outcome did not differ between groups at 1 year: 19·8% (41/207) in the 14-day full-dose group; 13·7% (14/102) in the 14-day low-dose group; 20·8% (22/106) in the 6-day full-dose group; and 20·4% (20/98) in the placebo group. 5% (19/415) of patients in the teplizumab groups were not taking insulin at 1 year, compared with no patients in the placebo group at 1 year (p=0·03). Across the four study groups, similar proportions of patients had adverse events (414/417 [99%] in the teplizumab groups vs 98/99 [99%] in the placebo group) and serious adverse events (42/417 [10%] vs 9/99 [9%]). The most common clinical adverse event in the teplizumab groups was rash (220/417 [53%] vs 20/99 [20%] in the placebo group).INTERPRETATION: Findings of exploratory analyses suggest that future studies of immunotherapeutic intervention with teplizumab might have increased success in prevention of a decline in β-cell function (measured by C-peptide) and provision of glycaemic control at reduced doses of insulin if they target patients early after diagnosis of diabetes and children.FUNDING: MacroGenics, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, and Eli Lilly.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
