Clinical presentations and the Salzburg EEG criteria for NCSE were used to identify patients with NCSE after CSE. Demographics, clinical features, and anti-epileptic treatment responses were collected and analyzed. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to evaluate three-month outcomes. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine independent prognostic factors.RESULTS: Among 145 consecutive patients with convulsive SE, 48 (33.1%) patents eventually evolved into NCSE. Two patients with cerebral anoxia were exclude. At three-month follow-up, 23 patients (50.0%) had mRS ≥ 3, and 16 (34.8%) died. Thirty-two patients (69.6%) were given continuous intravenous anesthetic drugs (CIVADs). Fourteen patients (30.4%) had CIVAD at the rate >50% proposed maximal dose (PMD). There was a single predictor factor found significant after multivariate logistic regression analysis: the recurrence of EEG seizures within two hours of initiation of CIVAD at a dose of greater than half the proposed maximal dose (OR, 9.63; 95%CI, 1.08-86.18; p = 0.043). The use of CIVAD, even with a high dose (>50% PMD), was not independently associated with unfavorable outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence of EEG seizures within two hours of initiation of CIVAD at a dose of greater than half the proposed maximal dose predicts unfavorable outcomes in NCSE after CSE. The refractoriness of the seizures might be a significantly greater risk for poor outcome in NCSE after CSE than treatment with CIVADs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

EEGs recorded in the ICU were classified using the Salzburg criteria for NCSE.RESULTS: only 23% (14/60) of the patients had NCSE confirmed by EEG. None of the semiological features could distinguish between patients with NCSE and those without. In both groups, the following phenomena were most common: discrete myoclonic muscle twitching and discrete tonic muscle activation. Besides these, automatisms and eye deviation were observed in both groups.CONCLUSION: subtle motor phenomena in critically ill patients can raise the suspicion of NCSE.

We implemented the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology, 2012 version (ACNS criteria) to increase the test performance of SCNC. In patients without preexisting epileptic encephalopathy, the following criteria were applied: (1) more than 25 epileptiform discharges (ED) per 10-second epoch, i.e., >2.5/s and (2) patients with EDs ≤ 2.5/s or rhythmic delta/theta activity (RDT) exceeding 0.5/s AND at least one of the additional criteria: (2a) clinical and EEG improvements from antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), (2b) subtle clinical phenomena, or (2c) typical spatiotemporal evolution. In case of fluctuation without evolution or EEG improvement without clinical improvement, \"possible NCSE\" was diagnosed. For identification of RDT, the following criteria were compared: (test condition A) continuous delta-theta activity without further rules, (B) ACNS criterion for rhythmic delta activity (RDA), and (C) ACNS criteria for RDA and fluctuation.RESULTS: False positive rate in controls dropped from 28% (condition A) to 2% (B) (p = 0.00039) and finally to 0% (C) (p = 0.000042). Application of test condition C in the group with NCSE gives one false negative (2%). Various EEG patterns were found in patients with NCSE: (1) 8.2%, (2a) 2%, (2b) 12.2%, and (2c) 32.7%. Possible NCSE was diagnosed based on fluctuations in 57.1% and EEG improvement without clinical improvement in 14.2%.CONCLUSION: The modified SCNC with refined definitions including the ACNS terminology leads to clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction of false positive diagnoses of NCSE and to minimal loss in sensitivity.

Patients in deep coma may exhibit epileptiform EEG patterns, such as generalized periodic spikes, and there is an ongoing debate about the relationship of these patterns and NCSE. The purposes of this review are (i) to discuss the various EEG patterns found in coma, its fluctuations, and transitions and (ii) to propose modified criteria for NCSE in coma. Classical coma patterns such as diffuse polymorphic delta activity, spindle coma, alpha/theta coma, low output voltage, or burst suppression do not reflect NCSE. Any ictal patterns with a typical spatiotemporal evolution or epileptiform discharges faster than 2.5 Hz in a comatose patient reflect nonconvulsive seizures or NCSE and should be treated. Generalized periodic diacharges or lateralized periodic discharges (GPDs/LPDs) with a frequency of less than 2.5 Hz or rhythmic discharges (RDs) faster than 0.5 Hz are the borderland of NCSE in coma. In these cases, at least one of the additional criteria is needed to diagnose NCSE (a) subtle clinical ictal phenomena, (b) typical spatiotemporal evolution, or (c) response to antiepileptic drug treatment. There is currently no consensus about how long these patterns must be present to qualify for NCSE, and the distinction from nonconvulsive seizures in patients with critical illness or in comatose patients seems arbitrary.

KMT2C (hereafter referred to as MLL3) frequently incurs point mutations across a range of human tumor types, but precisely how these lesions alter MLL3 function and contribute to oncogenesis is unclear. Here we report a cancer mutational hotspot in MLL3 within the region encoding its plant homeodomain (PHD) repeats and demonstrate that this domain mediates association of MLL3 with the histone H2A deubiquitinase and tumor suppressor BAP1. Cancer-associated mutations in the sequence encoding the MLL3 PHD repeats disrupt the interaction between MLL3 and BAP1 and correlate with poor patient survival. Cancer cells that had PHD-associated MLL3 mutations or lacked BAP1 showed reduced recruitment of MLL3 and the H3K27 demethylase KDM6A (also known as UTX) to gene enhancers. As a result, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in tumor cells harboring BAP1 or MLL3 mutations restored normal gene expression patterns and impaired cell proliferation in vivo. This study provides mechanistic insight into the oncogenic effects of PHD-associated mutations in MLL3 and suggests that restoration of a balanced state of Polycomb-COMPASS activity may have therapeutic efficacy in tumors that bear mutations in the genes encoding these epigenetic factors."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "KMT2C histone methyltransferase", "answer_start": 1667}], "question": "Which is the catalytic activity of the protein encoded by the gene KMT2C?

These cells, acquired non-invasively, represent a sample of highly relevant tumor tissue that is an alternative to difficult and low-yield tumor biopsies. In recent years, there has been growing interest in genomic profiling of CTCs to enable longitudinal monitoring of the tumor's adaptive response to therapy. However, due to their extreme rarity, genotyping CTCs has proved challenging. Relevant mutations can be masked by leukocyte contamination in isolates. Heterogeneity between subpopulations of tumor cells poses an additional obstacle. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing can overcome these limitations but isolation of single CTCs is prone to cell loss and is prohibitively difficult and time consuming. To address these limitations, we developed a single cell sample preparation and genome sequencing pipeline that combines biophysical enrichment and single cell isolation using laser capture microdissection (LCM). A key component of this process is the encapsulation of enriched CTC sample in a hydrogel matrix, which enhances the efficiency of single-cell isolation by LCM, and is compatible with downstream sequencing. We validated this process by sequencing of single CTCs and cell free DNA (cfDNA) from a single patient with castration resistant prostate cancer. Identical mutations were observed in prostate cancer driver genes (TP53, PTEN, FOXA1) in both single CTCs and cfDNA. However, two independently isolated CTCs also had identical missense mutations in the genes for ATR serine/threonine kinase, KMT2C histone methyltransferase, and FANCC DNA damage repair gene. These mutations may be missed by bulk sequencing libraries, whereas single cell sequencing could potentially enable the characterization of key CTC subpopulations that arise during metastasis."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " lysine methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C)", "answer_start": 270}], "question": "Which is the catalytic activity of the protein encoded by the gene KMT2C?

This study aimed to determine the expression and localization of connexins in neonatal myocytes transfected with wild-type (WT) or mutant LMNA to elucidate how these mutations cause heart diseases.METHODS: We studied the connexin 43 (Cx43) and connexin 40 (Cx40) expression in cultured neonatal myocytes transfected with wild-type (WT) or mutant LMNA (Glu82Lys (E82K) and Arg644Cys (R644C)) using confocal imaging and Western blotting analysis.RESULTS: Cx43 protein expression was reduced by 40% in cells transfected with LMNA E82K than that in cells transfected with WT LMNA cDNA.

We also investigated the connection between myocardial fibrosis and conduction abnormalities.METHODS: Seventeen lamin A/C mutation carriers underwent CMR. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and cine images were performed to evaluate myocardial fibrosis, regional wall motion, longitudinal myocardial function, global function and volumetry of both ventricles. The location, pattern and extent of enhancement in the left ventricle (LV) myocardium were visually estimated.RESULTS: Patients had LV myocardial fibrosis in 88% of cases. Segmental wall motion abnormalities correlated strongly with the degree of enhancement. Myocardial enhancement was associated with conduction abnormalities. Sixty-nine percent of our asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients showed mild ventricular dilatation, systolic failure or both in global ventricular analysis. Decreased longitudinal systolic LV function was observed in 53% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac conduction abnormalities, mildly dilated LV and depressed systolic dysfunction are common in DCM caused by a lamin A/C gene mutation.

Five different loci that cosegregate with the disease have been mapped so far; the identification of the disease genes is still in progress. The only disease gene known so far is the dystrophin gene, which causes X-linked DC. By analogy with dystrophin, it is believed that other cytoskeletal proteins could be involved in the pathogenesis of DC.

Specifically, we find that cardiac function is impaired upon fasting in systemic and cardiac specific Klf15-null mice. Further, cardiac specific Klf15-null mice display a fasting-dependent accumulation of long chain acylcarnitine species along with a decrease in expression of the carnitine translocase Slc25a20.

After treatment of the mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V max was increased by deacetylation.

We collected data on clinicopathologic features, treatments and outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 or STATASE 14.0.RESULTS: The median follow-up was 60.1 months. Of 2315 patients, 1289 (53%) were treated with 2D-RT and 1026 (47%) with IMRT.

Patients and Methods : A total of 1811 patients with non-metastatic NPC treated with IMRT (with or without chemotherapy) between October 2009 and February 2012 at our center were involved for building the nomograms. Nomograms for LR-free rate and RR-free rate at 3- and 5- year were generated as visualizations of Cox proportional hazards regression models, and validated using bootstrap resampling, estimating discrimination and calibration. Results: With a median follow up of 49.50 months, the 3- and 5- year LR-free rate were 95.43% and 94.30% respectively; the 3- and 5- year RR-free rate were 95.94% and 95.41% respectively. The final predictive model for LR included age, the neutrophil/leukocyte ratio (NWR), pathological type, primary gross tumor volume, maxillary sinus invasion, ethmoidal sinus invasion and lacerated foramen invasion; the model for RR involved NWR, plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA copy number, cervical lymph node volume and N category. The models showed fairly good discriminatory ability with concordance indices (c-indices) of 0.76 and 0.74 for predicting LR and RR, respectively, as well as good calibration. The proposed stratification of risk groups based on the nomograms allowed significant distinction between Kaplan-Meier curves for LR and RR. Conclusions: The proposed nomograms resulted in more-accurate prognostic prediction for LR and RR with a high concordance, hence to inform patients with high risk of recurrence on more aggressive therapy.

In comparison, TMV returned to pre-cast level at 12 weeks (-0.1%) in the placebo group. The increased adiposity of the casted leg was sustained in the placebo group and decreased substantially in the bimagrumab group at Week 12 (IMAT: -6.6%, SCAT: -3.5%).

The location of this niche varies across species, but the evolutionary pressures that drive HSPCs to different microenvironments remain unknown. The niche is located in the bone marrow in adult mammals, whereas it is found in other locations in non-mammalian vertebrates, for example, in the kidney marrow in teleost fish. Here we show that a melanocyte umbrella above the kidney marrow protects HSPCs against ultraviolet light in zebrafish. Because mutants that lack melanocytes have normal steady-state haematopoiesis under standard laboratory conditions, we hypothesized that melanocytes above the stem cell niche protect HSPCs against ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage. Indeed, after ultraviolet-light irradiation, unpigmented larvae show higher levels of DNA damage in HSPCs, as indicated by staining of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and have reduced numbers of HSPCs, as shown by cmyb (also known as myb) expression.

The location of this niche varies across species, but the evolutionary pressures that drive HSPCs to different microenvironments remain unknown. The niche is located in the bone marrow in adult mammals, whereas it is found in other locations in non-mammalian vertebrates, for example, in the kidney marrow in teleost fish. Here we show that a melanocyte umbrella above the kidney marrow protects HSPCs against ultraviolet light in zebrafish. Because mutants that lack melanocytes have normal steady-state haematopoiesis under standard laboratory conditions, we hypothesized that melanocytes above the stem cell niche protect HSPCs against ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage. Indeed, after ultraviolet-light irradiation, unpigmented larvae show higher levels of DNA damage in HSPCs, as indicated by staining of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and have reduced numbers of HSPCs, as shown by cmyb (also known as myb) expression.

Press releases and bibliographies were reviewed for additional information and citations.STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Belimumab was first identified and studied as a human protein target in 1999. Therefore, all published clinical trials and abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of belimumab for treatment of SLE as well as review articles from 1999 to present were evaluated for inclusion. Additional data were extracted from the manufacturer's Web site and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents.DATA SYNTHESIS: Current therapies for SLE target nonspecific sites for inflammatory reduction and immune system suppression. Belimumab is a target-specific, human IgG1λ monoclonal B-lymphocyte stimulator inhibitor currently in late stage investigation for the treatment of SLE. Unpublished Phase 3 trials have reported statistically significant results for primary endpoints when belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard of care was compared to placebo plus standard of care in seropositive patients with SLE. Overall, belimumab has been relatively well tolerated with discontinuation rates and adverse events similar to those of placebo. If belimumab is approved by the FDA, its US market launch would be expected in 2011.CONCLUSIONS: Belimumab has shown significant benefits for patients with SLE in the few Phase 3 trials that have been published.

If more than 54% of the lesions on any given scan show the CVS, then the patient can be given a diagnosis of MS with an accuracy of 94% (95% CIs 81.34, 99.32, p < 0.001, sensitivity/specificity 90%/100%).CONCLUSION: The clinical value of the CVS in the context of the differential diagnosis between MS and NMOSD, previously suggested using 7T scanners, is now extended to clinical 3T scanners, thereby making a step towards the use of CVS in clinical practice.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that the CVS on 3T MRI accurately distinguishes patients with MS from those with seropositive NMOSD.© 2018 American Academy of Neurology."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In contrary, MannKind Corporation started developing its ultra-rapid-acting insulin Afrezza in a bold bid, probably by managing the issues in which Exubera was not successful.

Our findings suggested that multiple gene duplications have occurred in the formation of PTEN/PTENp gene family during the evolution of mammals. Some PTENps were relatively ancient and were shared by primates and rodents; others were newly originated through species- specific gene duplications.

To ascertain the real impact of BANK1 on RA genetic susceptibility, we performed a large meta-analysis including our original data and tested for an epistatic interaction between BANK1 and BLK in RA susceptibility.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated data for 1,915 RA patients and 1,915 ethnically matched healthy controls genotyped for BANK1 rs10516487 and rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113. The association of each SNP and RA was tested by logistic regression. Multivariate analysis was then used with an interaction term to test for an epistatic interaction between the SNPs in the 2 genes.RESULTS: None of the SNPs tested individually was significantly associated with RA in the genotyped samples. However, we detected an epistatic interaction between BANK1 rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113 (P(interaction)  = 0.037).

The duration of remission also depended on the chosen therapy option for UC and the frequency of cell culture administration: the longer duration was recorded in patients who were infused thrice with allogeneic BM MSC.CONCLUSION: In the patients who had undergone one MSC administration, the risk of recurrent UC was higher than in those who had received MSC thrice during a month (a 2-year follow-up) and comparable with the RR of recurrent UC in the patient receiving only 5-ASA preparations, GCS, and/or immunosuppressants."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Open-Access Collaborative Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV)", "answer_start": 1234}], "question": "What is OAC CHV?", "id": "5e3ab4f8b5b409ea5300001b_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: The widely known terminology gap between health professionals and health consumers hinders effective information seeking for consumers.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to better understand consumers' usage of medical concepts by evaluating the coverage of concepts and semantic types of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) on diabetes-related postings in 2 types of social media: blogs and social question and answer (Q&A).METHODS: We collected 2 types of social media data: (1) a total of 3711 blogs tagged with \"diabetes\" on Tumblr posted between February and October 2015; and (2) a total of 58,422 questions and associated answers posted between 2009 and 2014 in the diabetes category of Yahoo! Answers. We analyzed the datasets using a widely adopted biomedical text processing framework Apache cTAKES and its extension YTEX. First, we applied the named entity recognition (NER) method implemented in YTEX to identify UMLS concepts in the datasets. We then analyzed the coverage and the popularity of concepts in the UMLS source vocabularies across the 2 datasets (ie, blogs and social Q&A). Further, we conducted a concept-level comparative coverage analysis between SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and Open-Access Collaborative Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV)-the top 2 UMLS source vocabularies that have the most coverage on our datasets. We also analyzed the UMLS semantic types that were frequently observed in our datasets.RESULTS: We identified 2415 UMLS concepts from blog postings, 6452 UMLS concepts from social Q&A questions, and 10,378 UMLS concepts from the answers. The medical concepts identified in the blogs can be covered by 56 source vocabularies in the UMLS, while those in questions and answers can be covered by 58 source vocabularies. SNOMED CT was the dominant vocabulary in terms of coverage across all the datasets, ranging from 84.9% to 95.9%. It was followed by OAC CHV (between 73.5% and 80.0%) and Metathesaurus Names (MTH) (between 55.7% and 73.5%). All of the social media datasets shared frequent semantic types such as \"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein,\" \"Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component,\" and \"Disease or Syndrome.\"CONCLUSIONS: Although the 3 social media datasets vary greatly in size, they exhibited similar conceptual coverage among UMLS source vocabularies and the identified concepts showed similar semantic type distributions. As such, concepts that are both frequently used by consumers and also found in professional vocabularies such as SNOMED CT can be suggested to OAC CHV to improve its coverage.©Min Sook Park, Zhe He, Zhiwei Chen, Sanghee Oh, Jiang Bian.

The Open Access and Collaborative Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV), which contains health-related terms used by lay consumers, has been created to bridge such a gap. Specifically, the OAC CHV facilitates consumers' health information retrieval by enabling consumer-facing health applications to translate between professional language and consumer friendly language. To keep up with the constantly evolving medical knowledge and language use, new terms need to be identified and added to the OAC CHV. User-generated content on social media, including social question and answer (social Q&A) sites, afford us an enormous opportunity in mining consumer health terms. Existing methods of identifying new consumer terms from text typically use ad-hoc lexical syntactic patterns and human review. Our study extends an existing method by extracting n-grams from a social Q&A textual corpus and representing them with a rich set of contextual and syntactic features. Using K-means clustering, our method, simiTerm, was able to identify terms that are both contextually and syntactically similar to the existing OAC CHV terms. We tested our method on social Q&A corpora on two disease domains: diabetes and cancer. Our method outperformed three baseline ranking methods. A post-hoc qualitative evaluation by human experts further validated that our method can effectively identify meaningful new consumer terms on social Q&A."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In advance of the 2015-2016 season, Fluzone Intradermal was replaced with Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent vaccine, which contains 9 µg hemagglutinin per strain of the two A-strain viruses and both B-strain lineage viruses (Victoria and Yamagata).", "answer_start": 322}], "question": "When was Fluzone Intradermal replaced with Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent?", "id": "5e7f5d0d835f4e4777000016_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "INTRODUCTION: An intradermal version of Fluzone® split-virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine, containing 9 µg hemagglutinin per strain of A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and one B lineage virus (Fluzone Intradermal, Sanofi Pasteur), became available in the US during the 2011-2012 influenza season for adults 18-64 years of age.
