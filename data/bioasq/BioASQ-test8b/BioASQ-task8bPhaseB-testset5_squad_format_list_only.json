Most solid tumors depend on other anti-apoptotic proteins, including MCL-1, for survival. The recent description of S63845 as the first specific and potent MCL-1 inhibitor represents an important therapeutic advance, since MCL-1 is not targeted by the currently available BH3 mimetics, Navitoclax or Venetoclax, and is commonly associated with chemoresistance. In this study, we confirm a high binding affinity and selectivity of S63845 to induce apoptosis in MCL-1-dependent cancer cell lines. Furthermore, S63845 synergizes with other BH3 mimetics to induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from both hematological and solid tumors. Although the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members in these cell lines interact with a spectrum of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins to regulate apoptosis, these interactions alone do not explain the relative sensitivities of these cell lines to BH3 mimetic-induced apoptosis. These findings necessitated further investigation into the requirement of BH3-only proteins in BH3 mimetic-mediated apoptosis. Concurrent inhibition of BCL-XL and MCL-1 by BH3 mimetics in colorectal HCT116 cells induced apoptosis in a BAX- but not BAK-dependent manner. Remarkably this apoptosis was independent of all known BH3-only proteins. Although BH3-only proteins were required for apoptosis induced as a result of BCL-XL inhibition, this requirement was overcome when both BCL-XL and MCL-1 were inhibited, implicating distinct mechanisms by which different anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members may regulate apoptosis in cancer."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " We tested the efficacy of the BH3 mimetic combination of A-1210477 (an MCL-1 inhibitor)", "answer_start": 462}], "question": "List Mcl-1 inhibitors.", "id": "5e6e8897c6a8763d23000003_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Despite the recent advancement in treating melanoma, options are still limited for patients without BRAF mutations or in relapse from current treatments.

We tested the efficacy of the BH3 mimetic combination of A-1210477 (an MCL-1 inhibitor) and ABT-263 (a BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor) in killing melanoma, especially MICs. We also sought to better define Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (DRP-1)'s role in melanoma; DRP-1 is known to interact with members of the BCL-2 family and is a possible therapeutic target for melanoma treatment. We used multiple assays (cell viability, apoptosis, bright field, immunoblot, and sphere formation), as well as the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing techniques. For clinical relevance, we employed patient samples of different mutation status, including some relapsed from current treatments such as anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We found the BH3 mimetic combination kill both the MICs and non-MICs (bulk of melanoma) in all cell lines and patient samples irrespective of the mutation status or relapsed state (p < 0.05). Unexpectedly, the major pro-apoptotic proteins, NOXA and BIM, are not necessary for the combination-induced cell death. Furthermore, the combination impedes the activation of DRP-1, and inhibition of DRP-1 further enhances apoptosis (p < 0.05). DRP-1 effects in melanoma differ from those seen in other cancer cells. These results provide new insights into BCL-2 family's regulation of the apoptotic pathway in melanoma, and suggest that inhibiting the major anti-apoptotic proteins is sufficient to induce cell death even without involvement from major pro-apoptotic proteins.

Previous studies have shown that while treatment of NPC cells with Bcl-2 family inhibitors alone is rarely effective, concomitant treatment with a cytotoxic reagent such as cisplatin can increase efficacy through a synergistic effect. The aim of the current work was to determine how we might increase the efficacy of Bcl-2 family inhibitors in the absence of cytotoxic reagents, which are associated with negative side effect profiles.METHODS: We assessed cell proliferation in Bcl-2 high-expressing NPC cells by CCK-8 assay after treatment with the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 and/or the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845. Apoptotic induction by ABT-199 was evaluated by Annexin V-FITC and PI double staining. We also evaluated Bcl-2 family protein expression (Bim, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, Noxa) after treatment with ABT-199 by western blotting. Finally, xenografted Balb/c nude mice were used to test ABT-199 efficacy in vivo, H&E and immunohistochemistry assay were used to analyze tumor samples.RESULTS: ABT-199 effectively induced NPC cell apoptosis in vitro and in the xenograft model. Following ABT-199 treatment in NPC cells, upregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL can lead to drug resistance, while concomitant Noxa overexpression partially neutralized the Mcl-1-caused resistance. Given that ABT-199 induces apoptosis in NPC cells through the Bcl-2/Noxa/Mcl-1 axis, treatment avenues further targeting this pathway should be promising. Indeed, the newly developed Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 in combination with ABT-199 had a synergistic effect on NPC cell apoptosis.CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 inhibition in NPC cells with ABT-199 triggers apoptosis through the Bcl-2/Noxa/Mcl-1 axis, and dual inhibition of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 provided a strong synergistic effect without the need for adjunctive cytotoxic agent treatment with cisplatin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Isolation of naive T cells from a murine model of lupus revealed increased levels of CaMK4 following stimulation with Th17-inducing cytokines but not following Treg, Th1, or Th2 induction. Furthermore, naive T cells from mice lacking CaMK4 did not produce IL-17. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of CaMK4 decreased the frequency of IL-17-producing T cells and ameliorated EAE and lupus-like disease in murine models. Inhibition of CaMK4 reduced Il17 transcription through decreased activation of the cAMP response element modulator α (CREM-α) and reduced activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, which is known to enhance Th17 differentiation. Importantly, silencing CaMK4 in T cells from patients with SLE and healthy individuals inhibited Th17 differentiation through reduction of IL17A and IL17F mRNA.

The emergence of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has been considered to be because of the excessive use of antimalarial drugs worldwide. Moreover, the intense distribution and prevalence of chloroquine-resistant strains in endemic regions has aided the incidence of more complications to malaria treatment and control. Due to the lack of literature that portrays evident molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, it has been difficult to understand the drug resistance conferred by Plasmodium species. Intensive research on CQ drug resistance has identified the association of P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter protein (PfCRT), which belongs to the drug/metabolite transporter and EamA-like superfamily. Additionally, it has shown that K76 T mutation in PfCRT protein has mainly attributed to CQ resistance than other mutations. This study deals with the development of an in silico model of the PfCRT protein and its interaction with the CQ ligand molecule as well as the biochemical and biophysical characterization of the transmembrane domain 1 (TMD 1) peptide of the PfCRT protein. The physiochemical analysis of the PfCRT protein identified basic differences between the wild and mutant forms of the protein, as well as identifying the high hydrophobic nature of the mutant-type protein. The tertiary structure of the PfCRT protein was predicted and interaction with CQ revealed different active pocket binding regions in both the wild and mutant form of PfCRT proteins. The CQ2+ molecule interacts with TMD 10 of the wild-type PfCRT protein, whereas it interacts with TMD 1 of the mutant-type protein. Studies on the TMD 1 peptide revealed the insertion of the peptide in the micelles adopting stable alpha-helical structure. Binding studies with the CQ molecule detected high binding affinity toward the mutant-type TMD 1 peptide rather than the wild-type, thus confirming that the TMD 1 peptide is involved in substrate selectivity. Our findings help to characterize the structure of the PfCRT protein and the role played by the TMD 1 region in CQ resistance using in silico and biochemical approaches. Molecular docking and ligand binding studies confirm that TMD 1 is involved in substrate selectivity and aids in CQ efflux, thereby contributing to the parasite's CQ drug resistance mechanism."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Historically chloroquine was used to treat the most deadly form of malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum.

Antagonizing HMGB1 prolongs muscle necrosis and deters regeneration. In this study, we evaluated HMGB1 expression in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and the mechanisms that promote its release in a murine model of hindlimb ischemia. Specifically, we investigated how chloroquine (CQ), a commonly employed disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, promotes HMGB1 release from muscle. We hypothesized that CQ could increase HMGB1 locally and systemically, allowing it to mediate recovery from ischemic injury.METHODS: Muscle biopsies were performed on patients undergoing lower extremity surgery for non-PAD-related disease as well as for claudication and critical limb ischemia. Clinical symptoms and ankle-brachial indices were recorded for each patient. HMGB1 was detected in muscle sections using immunohistochemical staining. Unilateral femoral artery ligation was performed on both wild-type and inducible HMGB1 knockout mice. Wild-type mice were administered intraperitoneal CQ 2 weeks before and after femoral artery ligation. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging was used to determine perfusion recovery. Serum and tissue levels of HMGB1 were measured at designated time points. In vitro, cultured C2C12 myoblasts were treated with increasing doses of CQ. HMGB1, autophagosome formation, p62/SQSTM1 accumulation, caspase-1 expression and activity, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were measured in supernatants and cell lysates.RESULTS: Nuclear expression of HMGB1 was prominent in patients with claudication and critical limb ischemia (P < .05) compared with controls. CQ-treated mice had elevated serum HMGB1 and diffuse HMGB1 staining in muscle (P < .01). In wild-type mice, CQ treatment resulted in higher laser Doppler perfusion imaging ratios in the ischemic limb at 7 days (P < .03) and less fat replacement after 2 weeks (P < .03). In cultured myoblasts, CQ induced autophagosome accumulation, inhibited p62/SQSTM-1 degradation, and activated caspase-1.CONCLUSIONS: HMGB1 is prominently expressed in PAD muscle but mostly confined to the nucleus. Our in vivo data suggest that HMGB1 mobilization into the sarcoplasm and serum can be increased with CQ, possibly through caspase-1-mediated pathways. Whereas HMGB1 can be released by many cell types, these studies suggest that the muscle may be an important additional source that is relevant in PAD.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

It is also licensed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Studies of HCQ-treated patients with SLE or RA have demonstrated a positive correlation between whole-blood HCQ levels and clinical response. Such studies have involved measuring whole-blood concentrations at any given time point after HCQ ingestion assuming that steady-state concentrations would undergo limited fluctuation over a daily interval because HCQ has a long half-life. This approach might not sufficiently take into account the potential intra-patient variation in HCQ blood levels that can occur over a 24-hour period. Such variation, if significant, could affect the credibility of any concentration-response relationship provided from these previous studies. Objectives The objectives of this report are to: (a) investigate the intra-patient variation in HCQ whole-blood levels and (b) suggest an optimum time for sampling patients for future studies. Methods Six patients were recruited with cutaneous lupus erythematosus who had each been on HCQ 200 mg twice daily for at least six months, so that they were at steady-state. Each patient was fasted overnight and had standardized meals and dosing schedule. Whole blood was sampled at seven time points over 24 hours. Whole-blood HCQ levels were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography using gradient elution, fluorimetric detection and chloroquine as an internal standard. The assay had a mean inter- and intra-day coefficient of variation of 10% and 5% respectively and a limit of detection of 5ng/ml. Results HCQ levels appeared to follow a biphasic pattern over the sampling period. Maximum levels were noted a median of four hours (range 2-6) after ingestion. Median intra-patient variation between trough and peak levels, 'Cmax' ((peak - trough)/trough × 100%), was 27% (range 8-150%). Conclusions This study demonstrated that whole-blood HCQ levels vary 27% (median, range 8-150%) within an individual over a 12-hour period. Drug levels might differ between individuals because of multiple factors, including variable adherence to medication. Measuring HCQ levels for assessment of drug adherence could be valuable in the 'real-world' clinical setting. This could be assessed by taking a blood sample at any time following HCQ ingestion. If patients were found to have very low or undetectable levels of HCQ, non-adherence to HCQ should be suspected."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Two rotavirus vaccines, RotaTeq and Rotarix, are licensed for global use; however, the protection they confer to unvaccinated individuals through indirect effects remains unknown.

Despite its beneficial therapeutic effects on tumor cells, exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) is associated with several side effects. Although improvements in radiotherapy techniques and instruments could reduce these side effects, there are still important concerns for cancer patients. For several years, scientists have been trying to modulate tumor and normal tissue responses to IR, leading to an increase in therapeutic ratio. So far, several types of radioprotectors and radiosensitizers have been investigated in experimental studies. However, high toxicity of chemical sensitizers or possible tumor protection by radioprotectors creates a doubt for their clinical applications. On the other hand, the protective effects of these radioprotectors or sensitizer effects of radiosensitizers may limit some type of cancers. Hence, the development of some radioprotectors without any protective effect on tumor cells or low toxic radiosensitizers can help improve therapeutic ratio with less side effects. Melatonin as a natural body hormone is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that shows some anti-cancer properties. It is able to neutralize different types of free radicals produced by IR or pro-oxidant enzymes which are activated following exposure to IR and plays a key role in the protection of normal tissues. In addition, melatonin has shown the ability to inhibit long-term changes in inflammatory responses at different levels, thereby ameliorating late side effects of radiotherapy. Fortunately, in contrast to classic antioxidants, some in vitro studies have revealed that melatonin has a potent anti-tumor activity when used alongside irradiation. However, the mechanisms of its radiosensitive effect remain to be elucidated. Studies suggested that the activation of pro-apoptosis gene, such as p53, changes in the metabolism of tumor cells, suppression of DNA repair responses as well as changes in biosynthesis of estrogen in breast cancer cells are involved in this process.

However, most of the synthetic radioprotective compounds studied have shown inadequate clinical efficacy owing to their inherent toxicity and high cost. Hence, the development of radioprotective agents with lower toxicity and an extended window of protection has attracted a great deal of attention, and the identification of alternative agents that are less toxic and highly effective is an absolute necessity. Recent studies have shown that alpha-2-macroglobulin (α2M) possesses radioprotective effects. α2M is a tetrameric, disulfide-rich plasma glycoprotein that functions as a non-selective inhibitor of different types of non-specific proteases and as a carrier of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. α2M induces protein factors whose interplay underlies radioprotection, which supports the idea that α2M is the central effector of natural radioprotection in the rat. Pretreatment with α2M has also induced a significant reduction of irradiation-induced DNA damage and the complete restoration of liver and body weight. Mihailović et al. concluded that the radioprotection provided by α2M was in part mediated through cytoprotection of new blood cells produced in the bone marrow; these authors also indicated that an important aspect of the radioprotective effect of amifostine was the result of the induction of the endogenous cytoprotective capability of α2M. The radioprotective effects of α2M are possibly due to antioxidant, anti-fibrosis, and anti-inflammatory functions, as well as the maintenance of homeostasis, and enhancement of the DNA repair and cell recovery processes.

After 12 months of treatment, compared with the RRMS-C group, a significant reduction was observed in the number of head magnetic resonance imaging enhanced lesions and longer recurrence time in the RRMS-D group.CONCLUSION: The efficacy of natalizumab was better than alemtuzumab in the treatment of patients in the RRMS group, while there was no significant difference among other stages of MS patients, which provided the theoretical basis and clinical guidance for the treatment of different stages of MS."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Multiple sclerosis presents with different phenotypes, most commonly a relapsing-remitting course and, less frequently, a progressive accumulation of disability from disease onset (primary progressive multiple sclerosis).

Multiple sclerosis presents with different phenotypes, most commonly a relapsing-remitting course and, less frequently, a progressive accumulation of disability from disease onset (primary progressive multiple sclerosis). The majority of people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, after a variable time, switch to a stage characterised by gradual neurological worsening known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying multiple sclerosis, and it is believed that multiple genetic, environmental and endogenous factors are elements driving inflammation and ultimately neurodegeneration. Axonal loss and grey matter damage have been regarded as amongst the leading causes of irreversible neurological disability in the progressive stages. There are over a dozen disease-modifying therapies currently licenced for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, but none of these has provided evidence of effectiveness in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Recently, there has been some early modest success with siponimod in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and ocrelizumab in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Finding treatments to delay or prevent the courses of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is an unmet and essential goal of the research in multiple sclerosis. In this review, we discuss new findings regarding drugs with immunomodulatory, neuroprotective or regenerative properties and possible treatment strategies for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. We examine the field broadly to include trials where participants have progressive or relapsing phenotypes. We summarise the most relevant results from newer investigations from phase II and III randomised controlled trials over the past decade, with particular attention to the last 5 years."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " relapsing-remitting MS, primary and secondary progressive MS) ", "answer_start": 403}], "question": "List the stages/types of Multiple Sclerosis.", "id": "5e52c5166d0a27794100004d_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVE: To perform systematic transcriptomic analysis of multiple sclerosis (MS) risk genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of subjects with distinct MS stages and describe the pathways characterized by dysregulated gene expressions.METHODS: We monitored gene expression levels in PBMCs from 3 independent cohorts for a total of 297 cases (including clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS, primary and secondary progressive MS) and 96 healthy controls by distinct microarray platforms and quantitative PCR. Differential expression and pathway analyses for distinct MS stages were defined and validated by literature mining.RESULTS: Genes located in the vicinity of MS risk variants displayed altered expression in peripheral blood at distinct stages of MS compared with the healthy population. The frequency of dysregulation was significantly higher than expected in CIS and progressive forms of MS. Pathway analysis for each MS stage-specific gene list showed that dysregulated genes contributed to pathogenic processes with scientific evidence in MS.CONCLUSIONS: Systematic gene expression analysis in PBMCs highlighted selective dysregulation of MS susceptibility genes playing a role in novel and well-known pathogenic pathways."}]}]}
