					"context": "We investigated a series of uracil analogues by introducing various substituents on the phenyl ring of the N-3 aminoethyl side chain and evaluated their antagonistic activity against human gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors. Analogues with substituents at the ortho or meta position demonstrated potent in vitro antagonistic activity. Specifically, the introduction of a 2-OMe group enhanced nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) inhibition up to 6-fold compared to the unsubstituted analogue. We identified compound 12c as a highly potent GnRH antagonist with moderate CYP inhibition. Compound 12c showed potent and prolonged LH suppression after a single dose was orally administered in castrated monkeys compared to a known antagonist, Elagolix. We believe that our SAR study offers useful insights to design GnRH antagonists as a potential treatment option for endometriosis."

					"context": "INTRODUCTION: Elagolix is a novel, orally active, non-peptide, competitive gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist in development for the management of endometriosis with associated pain and heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids. The pharmacokinetics of elagolix have been well-characterized in phase I studies; however, elagolix population pharmacokinetics have not been previously reported. Therefore, a robust model was developed to describe elagolix population pharmacokinetics and to evaluate factors affecting elagolix pharmacokinetic parameters.METHODS: The data from nine clinical studies (a total of 1624 women) were included in the analysis: five phase I studies in healthy, premenopausal women and four phase III studies in premenopausal women with endometriosis.RESULTS: Elagolix population pharmacokinetics were best described by a two-compartment model with a lag time in absorption. Of the 15 covariates tested for effect on elagolix apparent clearance (CL/F) and/or volume of distribution only one covariate, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 genotype status, had a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, effect on elagolix CL/F.CONCLUSION: Elagolix pharmacokinetics were not affected by patient demographics and were similar between healthy women and women with endometriosis.

					"context": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of elagolix, an oral, nonpeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, over 12 months in women with endometriosis-associated pain.METHODS: Elaris Endometriosis (EM)-III and -IV were extension studies that evaluated an additional 6 months of treatment after two 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials (12 continuous treatment months) with two elagolix doses (150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily). Coprimary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of responders (clinically meaningful pain reduction and stable or decreased rescue analgesic use) based on average monthly dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain scores. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and endometrial and bone mineral density assessments. The power of Elaris EM-III and -IV was based on the comparison to placebo in Elaris EM-I and -II with an expected 25% dropout rate.RESULTS: Between December 28, 2012, and October 31, 2014 (Elaris EM-III), and between May 27, 2014, and January 6, 2016 (Elaris EM-IV), 569 participants were enrolled. After 12 months of treatment, Elaris EM-III responder rates for dysmenorrhea were 52.1% at 150 mg once daily (Elaris EM-IV 550.8%) and 78.2% at 200 mg twice daily (Elaris EMIV 575.9%). Elaris EM-III nonmenstrual pelvic pain responder rates were 67.5% at 150 mg once daily (Elaris EM-IV 566.4%) and 69.1% at 200 mg twice daily (Elaris EM-IV 567.2%).”After 12 months of treatment, Elaris EM-III dyspareunia responder rates were 45.2% at 150 mg once daily (Elaris EM-IV=45.9%) and 60.0% at 200 mg twice daily (Elaris EM-IV=58.1%). Hot flush was the most common adverse event. Decreases from baseline in bone mineral density and increases from baseline in lipids were observed after 12 months of treatment. There were no adverse endometrial findings.CONCLUSION: Long-term elagolix treatment provided sustained reductions in dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia. The safety was consistent with reduced estrogen levels and no new safety concerns were associated with long-term elagolix use.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01760954 and NCT02143713."

					"context": "Endometriosis is a chronic benign disease that affects women of reproductive age. Medical therapy is often the first line of management for women with endometriosis in order to ameliorate symptoms or to prevent post-surgical disease recurrence. Currently, there are several medical options for the management of patients with endometriosis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, being efficacious in relieving primary dysmenorrhea. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and progestins, available for multiple routes of administration, are effective first-line hormonal options. In fact, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that they succeed in improving pain symptoms in the majority of patients, are well tolerated and not expensive. Second-line therapy is represented by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Even if these drugs are efficacious in treating women not responding to COCs or progestins, they are not orally available and have a less favorable tolerability profile (needing an appropriate add-back therapy). The use of danazol is limited by the large availability of other better-tolerated hormonal drugs. Because few data are available on long-term efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors they should be administered only in women with symptoms refractory to other conventional therapies in a clinical research setting. Promising preliminary data have emerged from multicenter Phase III trials on elagolix, a new oral GnRH antagonist but non-inferiority RCT data are required to compare elagolix with first-line therapies for endometriosis."

A sample size of 65 per group was planned to compare elagolix with add-back to placebo on the primary end point: the percentage of women who had less than 80 mL menstrual blood loss and 50% or greater reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline to the last 28 days of treatment. Safety assessments included changes in bone mineral density.RESULTS: From April 8, 2013, to December 8, 2015, 571 women were enrolled, 567 were randomized and treated (cohort 1=259; cohort 2=308), and 80% and 75% completed treatment, respectively. Participants had a mean±SD age of 43±5 years (cohort 2, 42±5 years), and 70% were black (cohort 2, 74%). Primary end point responder rates in cohort 1 (cohort 2) were 92% (90%) for elagolix alone, 85% (73%) for elagolix with 0.5 mg estradiol/0.1 mg norethindrone acetate, 79% (82%) for elagolix with 1.0 mg estradiol/0.5 mg norethindrone acetate, and 27% (32%) for placebo (all P<.001 vs placebo). Elagolix groups had significant decreases compared with placebo in lumbar spine bone mineral density, which was attenuated by adding 1.0 mg estradiol/0.5 mg norethindrone acetate.CONCLUSION: Elagolix with and without add-back significantly reduced menstrual blood loss in women with uterine leiomyomas.

Patients with SLEDAI-2K renal, immunological and hematologic active descriptors were identified. The percentage of descriptors with partial and complete recovery was studied at one year and over the study period. Descriptive analysis and the Kaplan-Meier estimator were applied to study the time to partial and complete recovery.RESULTS: Of the 795 patients, 94% had an active system at some point during the study period. Partial recovery was shown in 66% of patients by SRI-50 for at least one descriptor over the study period. None of these partial findings identified would have been captured using SLEDAI-2K alone. The time to partial recovery identified by SRI-50 was shorter than the time to complete recovery identified by SLEDAI-2K.CONCLUSION: The SRI-50 is a valid responder index derived form SLEDAI-2K and is very helpful in identifying clinically important improvement in active laboratory descriptors in an efficient time."

Clinical and laboratory information necessary to compute the SLEDAI-2K and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology damage index was collected prospectively and entered onto a computerized database. Patients followed for a minimum of 3 visits, and without absence for a period > 18 consecutive months, were included in the study. Six different approaches to measure variability of SLEDAI-2K were evaluated for each visit, along with AMS. Approaches were the standard deviation, the slope, average rate of change by visit, the range, the coefficient of variation, and the Percentage of the visits with a change in SLEDAI-2K > or = 3. The SLE outcomes under study were death, presence of damage, coronary artery disease (CAD), and osteonecrosis (ON). The predictability of each outcome was evaluated through time-dependent covariate survival analyses. Regression models included other known major risk factors such as sex, age at diagnosis, SLEDAI-2K at presentation, and disease duration.RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-five patients seen from 1970 to 2002 were included. The average time between visits was 4.0 +/- 2.2 months. Eighty-five patients died, 325 developed damage, 55 had CAD, and 68 had ON. None of the 6 variability measures added more statistical significance in the prediction of any of the 4 outcomes. For the prediction of survival, AMS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, p < 0.0001] and age at diagnosis (HR 1.05, p < 0.0001) were the only significant risk factors. For presence of damage, AMS (HR 1.06, p < 0.0001), age at diagnosis (HR 1.02, p = 0.0004), and disease duration (HR 1.05, p < 0.0001) were predictors.

For ON, SLEDAI-2K at presentation (HR 1.04, p = 0.003) and disease duration (HR 0.92, p = 0.05) were significant risk factors.CONCLUSION: Multivariate analysis revealed that AMS, independent of variability of the SLEDAI-2K, is an important predictor of major outcomes in SLE."

LB-100 increased DNA double-strand breakage (measured by γ-H2AX), mitotic catastrophe cell death, and G2/M cell cycle arrest in irradiated meningioma cells. Also, LB-100 decreased activation of STAT3 and expression of its downstream proteins. In vivo, LB-100 and RT combined treatment prolonged the survival of mice with xenografts compared to RT alone. Taken together, these results provide convincing preclinical data to support the use of LB-100 as a radiosensitizing agent for treatment of malignant meningioma. Its potential for clinical application deserves further investigation."

Cells from XP group E (XP-E) patients have a defect in the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein complex (UV-DDB), involved in the damage recognition step of NER. UV-DDB comprises two subunits, products of the DDB1 and DDB2 genes, respectively. Mutations in the DDB2 gene account for the underlying defect in XP-E. The UV-DDB complex is a component of the newly identified cullin 4A-based ubiquitin E3 ligase, DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2). The E3 ubiquitin ligases recognize specific substrates and mediate their ubiquitination to regulate protein activity or target proteins for degradation by the proteasomal pathway. In this study, we have addressed the role of the UV-DDB-based E3 in NER and sought a physiological substrate. We demonstrate that monoubiquitinated histone H2A in native chromatin coimmunoprecipitates with the endogenous DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2) complex in response to UV irradiation. Further, mutations in DDB2 alter the formation and binding activity of the DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2) ligase, accompanied by impaired monoubiquitination of H2A after UV treatment of XP-E cells, compared with repair-proficient cells. This finding indicates that DDB2, as the substrate receptor of the DDB1-CUL4A-based ligase, specifically targets histone H2A for monoubiquitination in a photolesion-binding-dependent manner. Given that the loss of monoubiquitinated histone H2A at the sites of UV-damaged DNA is associated with decreased global genome repair in XP-E cells, this study suggests that histone modification, mediated by the XPE factor, facilitates the initiation of NER."

					"context": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a skin cancer-prone autosomal recessive disease characterized by inability to repair UV-induced DNA damage. The major form of XP is defective in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and comprises seven complementation groups (A-G). The genes defective in all groups have been identified unambiguously with the exception of group E. The cells of some XP-E patients are deficient in a protein complex (consisting of two subunits: p127/DDBI and p48/DDB2) which binds to UV-damaged DNA (UV-DDB) and is specifically involved in the removal of photoproducts from the non-transcribed regions of the genome. However, other XP-E patients have been reported not to lack UV-damaged DNA binding activity (DDB(+)). Here we describe several genetically unrelated XP-E patients, not previously analyzed in depth, each carrying two mutated alleles for DDB2, causing either a single amino acid change or a protein truncation or internal deletion. These defects result in a severe decrease of detectable p48 protein, abolish interaction with the p127 subunit, and produce a deficiency in UV-DDB binding activity (DDB(-)). The role of p48 in the repair defect of these patients was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. Investigation of four DDB(+) cell strains from patients previously assigned to XP-E, allowed us to reclassify all of them into other groups and to show that they do not share the molecular and biochemical features typical for XP-E. Besides confirming that the true XP-E phenotype is DDB(-), resulting from defects in a single gene, DDB2, our results identify the functional domains of the corresponding p48 protein."

					"context": "Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is a vexing and poorly understood autoimmune process involving the upper face and tissues surrounding the eyes. In TAO, the orbit can become inflamed and undergo substantial remodeling that is disfiguring and can lead to loss of vision. There are currently no approved medical therapies for TAO, the consequence of its uncertain pathogenic nature. It usually presents as a component of the syndrome known as Graves' disease where loss of immune tolerance to the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) results in the generation of activating antibodies against that protein and hyperthyroidism. The role for TSHR and these antibodies in the development of TAO is considerably less well established. We have reported over the past 2 decades evidence that the insulin-like growth factorI receptor (IGF1R) may also participate in the pathogenesis of TAO. Activating antibodies against IGF1R have been detected in patients with GD. The actions of these antibodies initiate signaling in orbital fibroblasts from patients with the disease. Further, we have identified a functional and physical interaction between TSHR and IGF1R. Importantly, it appears that signaling initiated from either receptor can be attenuated by inhibiting the activity of IGF1R. These findings underpin the rationale for therapeutically targeting IGF1R in active TAO. A recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a human IGF1R inhibiting antibody, in patients with moderate to severe, active TAO, indicates the potential effectiveness and safety of the drug. It is possible that other autoimmune diseases might also benefit from this treatment strategy."

					"context": "Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), a localized periocular manifestation of the autoimmune syndrome known as Graves' disease, remains incompletely understood. Discussions of its pathogenesis are generally focused on the thyrotropin receptor, the proposed role for which is supported by substantial evidence. Considerations of any involvement of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) in the disease are frequently contentious. In this brief, topically focused review, I have attempted to provide a balanced perspective based entirely on experimental results that either favor or refute involvement of IGF-IR in TAO. Discussion in this matter seems particularly timely since the currently available treatments of this disfiguring and potentially sight-threatening disease remain inadequate. Importantly, no medical therapy has thus far received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Results from a very recently published clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of teprotumumab, an inhibitory human anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibody, in active, moderate to severe TAO are extremely encouraging. That double-masked, placebo-controlled study involved 88 patients and revealed unprecedented clinical responses in the improvement of proptosis and clinical activity as well as a favorable safety profile. Should those results prove reproducible in an ongoing phase III trial, therapeutic inhibition of IGF-IR could become the basis for paradigm-shifting treatment of this vexing disease."

					"context": "Purpose: Orbital fibroblasts from patients with Graves' disease (GD-OF) express many different cytokines when treated with bovine thyrotropin (bTSH). The present study aimed to determine why TNF-α cannot be induced by bTSH in GD-OF.Methods: Fibrocytes and GD-OFs were cultivated from donors who were patients in a busy academic medical center practice. Real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, reporter gene assays, cell transfections, mRNA stability assays, ELISA, and flow cytometry were performed.Results: We found that bTSH induces TNF-α dramatically in fibrocytes but is undetectable in GD-OF. The induction in fibrocytes is a consequence of increased TNF-α gene promoter activity and is independent of ongoing protein synthesis. It could be attenuated by dexamethasone and the IGF-1 receptor inhibiting antibody, teprotumumab. When separated into pure CD34+ OF and CD34- OF subsets, TNF-α mRNA became highly inducible by bTSH in CD34+ OF but remained undetectable in CD34- OF. Conditioned medium from CD34- OF inhibited induction of TNF-α in fibrocytes.Conclusions: Our data indicate that CD34- OF appear to release a soluble(s) factor that downregulates expression and induction by bTSH of TNF-α in fibrocytes and their derivative CD34+ OF. We proffer that CD34- OF produce an unidentified modulatory factor that attenuates TNF-α expression in GD-OF and may do so in the TAO orbit."

					"context": "Graves' ophthalmopathy is defined as autoimmune inflammation of extraocular muscles and orbital fat or connective tissue, usually in patients with Graves' disease. About one in 20 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism has moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment, but new evidence about immune mechanisms has provided a basis to explore other drug classes. Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses are more effective and better tolerated than oral prednisone in the treatment of active, moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Rituximab has also been suggested as a possible replacement for intravenous corticosteroids. Two randomised controlled trials of rituximab reached seemingly contradictory conclusions-rituximab was not better with respect to the primary outcome (clinical activity score) than placebo in one trial (which, however, was confounded by rather long Graves' ophthalmopathy duration), but was slightly better than intravenous methylprednisolone pulses in the other (disease flare-ups occurred only in the latter group). On the basis of evidence published so far, rituximab cannot replace intravenous methylprednisolone pulses, but could have a role in corticosteroid-resistant cases. Open-label studies of tumour-necrosis-factor-α blockade had limited efficacy, but other studies showed that interleukin-6 receptor antibodies were effective. Results of randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of the IGF-1 receptor antibody teprotumumab and the interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab are expected shortly. Approaches that target the causal mechanism of Graves' ophthalmopathy (antibodies or antagonists that block thyroid-stimulating-hormone receptors) also look promising."

Current medical therapies, which primarily consist of glucocorticoids, have limited efficacy and present safety concerns. Inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is a new therapeutic strategy to attenuate the underlying autoimmune pathogenesis of ophthalmopathy.METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of teprotumumab, a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of IGF-IR, in patients with active, moderate-to-severe ophthalmopathy. A total of 88 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or active drug administered intravenously once every 3 weeks for a total of eight infusions. The primary end point was the response in the study eye. This response was defined as a reduction of 2 points or more in the Clinical Activity Score (scores range from 0 to 7, with a score of ≥3 indicating active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy) and a reduction of 2 mm or more in proptosis at week 24. Secondary end points, measured as continuous variables, included proptosis, the Clinical Activity Score, and results on the Graves' ophthalmopathy-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. Adverse events were assessed.RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat population, 29 of 42 patients who received teprotumumab (69%), as compared with 9 of 45 patients who received placebo (20%), had a response at week 24 (P<0.001). Therapeutic effects were rapid; at week 6, a total of 18 of 42 patients in the teprotumumab group (43%) and 2 of 45 patients in the placebo group (4%) had a response (P<0.001). Differences between the groups increased at subsequent time points. The only drug-related adverse event was hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes; this event was controlled by adjusting medication for diabetes.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with active ophthalmopathy, teprotumumab was more effective than placebo in reducing proptosis and the Clinical Activity Score.

Through whole-exome sequencing of Japanese ARCA patients, we identified three index patients from unrelated families who had biallelic mutations in ERCC4. ERCC4 mutations have been known to cause xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F (XP-F), Cockayne syndrome, and Fanconi anemia phenotypes. All of the patients described here showed very slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia and cognitive decline with choreiform involuntary movement, with young adolescent or midlife onset. Brain MRI demonstrated atrophy that included the cerebellum and brainstem. Of note, cutaneous symptoms were very mild: there was normal to very mild pigmentation of exposed skin areas and/or an equivocal history of pathological sunburn. However, an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay of fibroblasts from the patient revealed impairment of nucleotide excision repair. A similar phenotype was very recently recognized through genetic analysis of Caucasian cerebellar ataxia patients. Our results confirm that biallelic ERCC4 mutations cause a cerebellar ataxia-dominant phenotype with mild cutaneous symptoms, possibly accounting for a high proportion of the genetic causes of ARCA in Japan, where XP-F is prevalent."

					"context": "Biochemical risk assessment studies of chemicals that induce DNA lesions are important, because lesions in genomic DNA frequently result in cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging in humans. Many classes of DNA lesions induced by chemical agents are eliminated via DNA repair mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER), for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Individuals with NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), in which bulky DNA lesions are not efficiently removed, are cancer-prone and suffer neurodegeneration. For research into cancer and neurological diseases, therefore, it might be important to identify DNA damage from agents that induce NER-repairable bulky DNA lesions. However, simple and quick assays to detect such damaging agents have not been developed using human cells. Here, we report a simple, non-isotopic assay for determining DNA damaging agents that induce NER-repairable DNA lesions by visualizing gene expression from treated fluorescent protein vectors in a mammalian cell system. This assay is based on a comparison of fluorescent protein expression in NER-proficient and NER-deficient cells. When we tested UV-irradiated fluorescent protein vectors, the fluorescent protein was observed in NER-proficient cells, but not in NER-deficient cells. Similar results were obtained for vectors treated with the anticancer drug, cisplatin. In contrast, when treated with the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, believed to cause BER-repairable damage, no difference in gene expression between NER-proficient and NER-deficient cells was observed. These results suggest that our assay can specifically detect DNA-damaging agents that induce NER-repairable DNA lesions, and could be used to analyze chemicals with the potential to cause cancer and neurological diseases. With further validation, the assay might be also applicable to XP diagnosis."

					"context": "The ERCC1 and ERCC4 genes encode the two subunits of the ERCC1-XPF nuclease. This enzyme plays an important role in repair of DNA damage and in maintaining genomic stability. ERCC1-XPF nuclease nicks DNA specifically at junctions between double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, when the single-strand is oriented 5' to 3' away from a junction. ERCC1-XPF is a core component of nucleotide excision repair and also plays a role in interstrand crosslink repair, some pathways of double-strand break repair by homologous recombination and end-joining, as a backup enzyme in base excision repair, and in telomere length regulation. In many of these activities, ERCC1-XPF complex cleaves the 3' tails of DNA intermediates in preparation for further processing. ERCC1-XPF interacts with other proteins including XPA, RPA, SLX4 and TRF2 to perform its functions. Disruption of these interactions or direct targeting of ERCC1-XPF to decrease its DNA repair function might be a useful strategy to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to some DNA damaging agents. Complete deletion of either ERCC1 or ERCC4 is not compatible with viability in mice or humans. However, mutations in the ERCC1 or ERCC4 genes cause a remarkable array of rare inherited human disorders. These include specific forms of xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, Fanconi anemia, XFE progeria and cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome."

LLDAS attainment (SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 ≤4 without major organ activity, no new disease activity, Physician's Global Assessment ≤1, prednisolone ≤7.5 mg/d and standard immunosuppressant dosage tolerance) was assessed. Associations with endpoints and LLDAS attainment differences between treatments were explored.RESULTS: LLDAS attainment at Week 52 was associated with SLE Responder Index 4 (SRI[4]) and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) (74/85[87%] and 62/84[74%] were also SRI[4] and BICLA responders, respectively; both nominal p<0.001). Only 74/159 (47%) of SRI(4) and 62/121 (51%) of BICLA responders reached LLDAS.Anifrolumab-treated patients achieved earlier LLDAS, and more spent at least half their observed time in LLDAS (OR vs. placebo; 300 mg: 3.04, 95% CI 1.34 to 6.92, nominal p=0.008; 1,000 mg: 2.17, 95% CI 0.93 to 5.03, nominal p=0.072) vs placebo-treated patients. At Week 52, 17/102 (17%), 39/99 (39%) and 29/104 (28%) of patients on placebo, anifrolumab 300 and 1,000 mg, respectively, attained LLDAS (OR vs. placebo; 300 mg: 3.41, 95% CI 1.73 to 6.76, p<0.001; 1,000 mg: 2.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.07, nominal p=0.046).CONCLUSIONS: LLDAS attainment represents a clinically meaningful SLE outcome measure, and anifrolumab is associated with more patients who met LLDAS criteria versus placebo. These data support LLDAS as an SLE RCT endpoint.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT1438489; Post-results.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

					"context": "OBJECTIVES: In a post-hoc analysis, we aimed to validate the Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) definition as an endpoint in an systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Phase IIb randomised controlled trial (RCT) (MUSE [NCT01438489]) and then utilize LLDAS to discriminate between anifrolumab and placebo.METHODS: Patients received intravenous placebo (n=102) or anifrolumab (300 mg, n=99; 1,000 mg, n=104) Q4W plus standard of care for 48 weeks. LLDAS attainment (SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 ≤4 without major organ activity, no new disease activity, Physician's Global Assessment ≤1, prednisolone ≤7.5 mg/d and standard immunosuppressant dosage tolerance) was assessed. Associations with endpoints and LLDAS attainment differences between treatments were explored.RESULTS: LLDAS attainment at Week 52 was associated with SLE Responder Index 4 (SRI[4]) and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) (74/85[87%] and 62/84[74%] were also SRI[4] and BICLA responders, respectively; both nominal p<0.001). Only 74/159 (47%) of SRI(4) and 62/121 (51%) of BICLA responders reached LLDAS.Anifrolumab-treated patients achieved earlier LLDAS, and more spent at least half their observed time in LLDAS (OR vs. placebo; 300 mg: 3.04, 95% CI 1.34 to 6.92, nominal p=0.008; 1,000 mg: 2.17, 95% CI 0.93 to 5.03, nominal p=0.072) vs placebo-treated patients. At Week 52, 17/102 (17%), 39/99 (39%) and 29/104 (28%) of patients on placebo, anifrolumab 300 and 1,000 mg, respectively, attained LLDAS (OR vs. placebo; 300 mg: 3.41, 95% CI 1.73 to 6.76, p<0.001; 1,000 mg: 2.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.07, nominal p=0.046).CONCLUSIONS: LLDAS attainment represents a clinically meaningful SLE outcome measure, and anifrolumab is associated with more patients who met LLDAS criteria versus placebo.

Serial blood samples were collected up to Day 84 to measure anifrolumab concentrations and antidrug antibodies (ADAs). PK parameters were estimated by noncompartmental analysis.Results: Maximum serum concentrations in SC cohorts occurred after 4-7 days. Anifrolumab serum concentrations were below the limit of detection in all individuals by Day 84. Exposure to SC anifrolumab increased dose proportionally from 300 mg to 600 mg based on area under the serum concentration-time curve. Anifrolumab 300 mg SC exposure reached 87% of the intravenous exposure. Anifrolumab 300 mg SC and placebo administration elicited minimal injection-site reactions. Transient injection-site induration occurred in five of six individuals after anifrolumab 600 mg SC and two of four individuals after placebo. Transient, mild to moderate injection-site induration and pruritus occurred simultaneously in two of six individuals after anifrolumab 600 mg SC. Adverse events were reported by 50% (n=9) of anifrolumab-treated individuals and 33% (n=4) of placebo-treated individuals. ADAs were detected in only one individual in the anifrolumab 300-mg intravenous group at the Day 84 assessment.Conclusion: Anifrolumab 300-mg SC exposure was 87% of intravenous administration, with single SC anifrolumab administrations well tolerated in healthy volunteers."

Randomization was stratified by SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 score (<10 or ≥10), oral corticosteroid dosage (<10 or ≥10 mg/day), and type I IFN gene signature test status (high or low) based on a 4-gene expression assay. The primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving an SLE Responder Index (SRI[4]) response at week 24 with sustained reduction of oral corticosteroids (<10 mg/day and less than or equal to the dose at week 1 from week 12 through 24). Other end points (including SRI[4], British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG]-based Composite Lupus Assessment [BICLA], modified SRI[6], and major clinical response) were assessed at week 52. The primary end point was analyzed in the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population and type I IFN-high subpopulation. The study result was considered positive if the primary end point was met in either of the 2 study populations. The Type I error rate was controlled at 0.10 (2-sided), within each of the 2 study populations for the primary end point analysis.RESULTS: The primary end point was met by more patients treated with anifrolumab (34.3% of 99 for 300 mg and 28.8% of 104 for 1,000 mg) than placebo (17.6% of 102) (P = 0.014 for 300 mg and P = 0.063 for 1,000 mg, versus placebo), with greater effect size in patients with a high IFN signature at baseline (13.2% in placebo-treated patients versus 36.0% [P = 0.004] and 28.2% [P = 0.029]) in patients treated with anifrolumab 300 mg and 1,000 mg, respectively.

In SLE patients, genetic variants of IRF5 and IRF7 have been associated with increased serum IFNα levels, suggesting a pathogenic role in the type I IFN response. Clinical and molecular analyses of an SLE patient treated with high-dose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous stem cell transplant was performed. Western blot analysis showed that induction of IRF7 protein expression correlated with recurrent lupus disease activity. In addition, phosphorylation of IRF3 and activation of 4 E-BP1, a translational repressor of IRF7, preceded the disease flare. In SLE post-transplant, recurrent disease activity and induction of IRF7 protein expression correlated with activation of the IFN signature. This unique trend in regulation of IRF warrants further mechanistic investigation and confirmation with increased numbers of SLE patients."

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib (TOFA) for controlling IFN signalling via the JAK-STAT pathway and as a therapeutic for SLE.RESULTS: We treated NZB/NZW F1 mice with TOFA and assessed alterations in their disease, pathological, and immunological conditions. Gene-expression results obtained from CD4+ T cells (SLE mice) and CD3+ T cells (human SLE patients) were measured by DNA microarray and qRT-PCR. TOFA treatment resulted in reduced levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies, decreased proteinuria, and amelioration of nephritis as compared with those observed in control animals. Moreover, we observed the rebalance in the populations of naïve CD4+ T cells and effector/memory cells in TOFA-treated mice; however, treatment with a combination of TOFA and dexamethasone (DEXA) elicited a stronger inhibitory effect toward the effector/memory cells than did TOFA or DEXA monotherapy. We also detected decreased expression of several IFN-signature genes Ifit3 and Isg15 in CD4+ from SLE-prone mice following TOFA and DEXA treatment, and IFIT3 in CD3+ T cells from human patients following immunosuppressant therapy including steroid, respectively.CONCLUSION: Modulation of type I IFN signalling via JAK-STAT inhibition may exert a beneficial effect in SLE patients, and our results suggest that TOFA could be utilised for the development of new SLE-specific therapeutic strategies."

We previously reported that DCs from female lupus-prone mice constitutively overexpress IFN-responsive genes resembling the IFN signature found in SLE patients. As SLE has higher incidence in women than men, more so in women of reproductive age, estrogens are suggested to affect lupus pathogenesis. We investigated the effects of sex and estrogens on the IFN signature in conventional GM-CSF-bone marrow-derived DCs (cDCs), from male and female Triple Congenic B6.NZM.Sle1/Sle2/Sle3 (TCSle) lupus-prone mice or from wild-type C57BL/6 mice, generated with titrations of 17-beta-estradiol (E2). We found that cDCs from prediseased TCSle male mice express the IFN signature as female TCSle cDCs do. Estrogens are necessary but not sufficient to express this IFN signature, but high doses of E2 can compensate for other steroidal components. E2 stimulation, regardless of sex, modulates type I IFN-dependent and type I IFN-independent activation of cDCs in response to TLR stimulation. Finally, we found that TCSle cDCs from both sexes have elevated markers of immunometabolism and estrogens enhance the metabolic pathways in cDCs, suggesting a mechanistic link between estrogens, immunometabolism, and the IFN signature in lupus."

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of the IFN-I signature and the contribution of cytosolic nucleic acid receptors to IFN-I activation in a cohort of primarily white cSLE patients.METHODS: The IFN-I score (positive or negative), as a measure of IFN-I activation, was assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) expression values of IFN-I signature genes (IFI44, IFI44L, IFIT1, Ly6e, MxA, IFITM1) in CD14+ monocytes of cSLE patients and healthy controls (HCs). Innate immune receptor expression was determined by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. To clarify the contribution of RNA-binding RIG-like receptors (RLRs) and DNA-binding receptors (DBRs) to IFN-I activation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients were treated with BX795, a TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) inhibitor blocking RLR and DBR pathways.RESULTS: The IFN-I signature was positive in 57% of cSLE patients and 15% of the HCs. Upregulated gene expression of TLR7, RLRs (IFIH1, DDX58, DDX60, DHX58) and DBRs (ZBP-1, IFI16) was observed in CD14+ monocytes of the IFN-I-positive cSLE patients. Additionally, RIG-I and ZBP-1 protein expression was upregulated in these cells. Spontaneous IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG) expression in PBMCs from cSLE patients was inhibited by a TBK1-blocker.CONCLUSIONS: IFN-I activation, assessed as ISG expression, in cSLE is associated with increased expression of TLR7, and RNA and DNA binding receptors, and these receptors contribute to IFN-I activation via TBK1 signaling. TBK1-blockers may therefore be a promising treatment target for SLE."

					"context": "Photolyases (PHRs) and cryptochromes (CRYs) belong to the same family known as blue-light photoreceptors. Although their amino acid sequences and corresponding structures are similar to each other, they exert different functions. PHRs function as an enzyme to repair UV-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) lesions such as a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and a (6-4) photoproduct ((6-4)pp), whereas CRYs are a circadian photoreceptor in plants and animals and at the same time they control the photoperiodic induction of flowering in plants. When a new type cryptochrome was identified, it was assumed that another type of CRYs, cryptochrome-DASH (CRY-DASH), which is categorized as a subfamily of photolyase/cryptochrome family, would possess the DNA photolyase activity. However, CRY-DASH had a weak DNA photolyase activity, but the reason for this is still unclear. To clarify the reason, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a complex of CPD-PHR or CRY-DASH with damaged double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and estimated the binding free energy, ΔGbind, between the protein and the damaged dsDNA by using a molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) method. ΔGbind for both proteins were -35 and 57 kcal mol-1, respectively, indicating that the structural stability of CRY-DASH was lower than that of CPD-PHR upon the damaged dsDNA binding. In particular, the number of amino acid residues relevant to the damaged dsDNA binding on the CRY-DASH surface was smaller than that on CPD-PHR. Therefore, the present result suggests that CRY-DASH has a weak DNA photolyase activity because it has a lower binding affinity than CPD-PHR."

					"context": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sotatercept and luspatercept are recombinant soluble activin type-II receptor-IgG-Fc fusion proteins that are tested in clinical trials for the treatment of various types of anemias, including renal anemia. The mechanism of the action of the novel drugs is incompletely understood, but it seems to be based on the inactivation of soluble proteins of the transforming growth factor-ß (TGFß) family. This review considers pros and cons of the clinical use of the drugs in reference to the current therapy with recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).RECENT FINDINGS: One or more activin type-II receptor (ActRII) ligands appear to inhibit erythroid precursors, for example growth and differentiation factor 11. Trapping of these ligands by the recombinant ActRII fusion proteins, sotatercept and luspatercept increases red blood cell numbers and hemoglobin levels in humans. Reportedly, the novel compounds were well tolerated in trials on healthy volunteers and patients suffering from anemia due to chronic kidney disease or malignancies. On approval, the drugs may prove particularly useful in patients suffering from ineffective erythropoiesis, such as in myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma or ß-thalassemia, where ESAs are of little use. Independent of their effect on erythropoiesis, ActRII ligand traps were found to exert beneficial effects on renal tissue in experimental animals.SUMMARY: ESAs are likely to remain standard of care in renal anemia. There is a need for a better understanding of the effects of ActRII ligand traps on TGFß-like proteins. The novel drugs have not been approved for sale as therapeutics so far. Their long-term efficacy and safety still needs to be proven, particularly with respect to immunogenicity. Antifibrotic effects may be worthy to be investigated in humans."

Within this study, ammonium sulfate precipitation, immunoaffinity purification, tryptic digestion, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were employed to develop an assay for the combined detection of Sotatercept and Luspatercept in doping control serum samples. The assay was optimized, comprehensively characterized, and found to be fit-for-purpose for application to sports drug testing. It complements existing tests for ActRII-Fc fusion proteins and expands the range of available detection methods for novel protein therapeutics."

					"context": "Transfusion combined with chelation therapy for severe β thalassemia syndromes (transfusion-dependent thalassemia [TDT]) has been successful in extending life expectancy, decreasing comorbidities and improving quality of life. However, this puts lifelong demands not only on the patients but also on the health care systems that are tasked with delivering long-term treatment and comprehensive support. Prevention programs and curative approaches are therefore an important part of overall strategy. Curative treatments alter the dynamic of a patient's health care costs, from financial commitment over 50 years, into a potential \"one-off\" investment. Since the 1980s, this has usually been available only to the 30% or so of young children with matched sibling donors. By improving the safety of matched related donors and haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplants, the potential size of the donor pool for curative therapies may be increased. Recent advances in gene therapy demonstrate that even patients lacking a matched donor can be rendered transfusion independent with an autograft of genetically modified autologous stem cells, with a low short-term risk. Noncurative treatments are also of potential value by decreasing use of blood and chelators and decreasing hospital visits. An example is luspatercept, an activin-receptor trap that modifies transforming growth factor-β signaling, thereby increasing the efficiency of erythropoiesis. This has entered phase 3 clinical trials for TDT and non-TDT and, usefully increases in both Hb and quality of life in non-TDT as well as decreasing transfusion requirements in TDT. Other novel noncurative treatments are entering clinical trials such improvement of erythropoiesis through pharmacological manipulation of hepcidin and iron metabolism."

Luspatercept (ACE-536) is a novel fusion protein that blocks transforming growth factor beta (TGF β) superfamily inhibitors of erythropoiesis, giving rise to a promising new investigative therapy. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of luspatercept in patients with anaemia due to lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.METHODS: In this phase 2, multicentre, open-label, dose-finding study (PACE-MDS), with long-term extension, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had International Prognostic Scoring System-defined low or intermediate 1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes or non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (white blood cell count <13 000/μL), and had anaemia with or without red blood cell transfusion support. Enrolled patients were classified as having low transfusion burden, defined as requiring less than 4 red blood cell units in the 8 weeks before treatment (and baseline haemoglobin <10 g/dL), or high transfusion burden, defined as requiring 4 or more red blood cell units in the 8 weeks before treatment. Patients received luspatercept subcutaneously once every 21 days at dose concentrations ranging from 0·125 mg/kg to 1·75 mg/kg bodyweight for five doses (over a maximum of 12 weeks). Patients in the expansion cohort were treated with 1·0 mg/kg luspatercept; dose titration up to 1·75 mg/kg was allowed, and patients could be treated with luspatercept for a maximum of 5 years. Patients in the base study were assessed for response and safety after 12 weeks in order to be considered for enrolment into the extension study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving modified International Working Group-defined haematological improvement-erythroid (HI-E), defined as a haemoglobin concentration increase of 1·5 g/dL or higher from baseline for 14 days or longer in low transfusion burden patients, and a reduction in red blood cell transfusion of 4 or more red blood cell units or a 50% or higher reduction in red blood cell units over 8 weeks versus pre-treatment transfusion burden in high transfusion burden patients. Patient data were subcategorised by: luspatercept dose concentrations (0·125-0·5 mg/kg vs 0·75-1·75 mg/kg); pre-study transfusion burden (high transfusion burden vs low transfusion burden, defined as ≥4 vs <4 red blood cell units per 8 weeks); pre-study serum erythropoietin concentration (<200 IU/L, 200-500 IU/L, and >500 IU/L); presence of 15% or more ring sideroblasts; and presence of SF3B1 mutations. Efficacy analyses were carried out on the efficacy evaluable and intention-to-treat populations. This trial is currently ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01749514 and NCT02268383.FINDINGS: Between Jan 21, 2013, and Feb 12, 2015, 58 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were enrolled in the 12 week base study at nine treatment centres in Germany; 27 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation cohorts (0·125-1·75 mg/kg) and 31 patients in the expansion cohort (1·0-1·75 mg/kg). 32 (63% [95% CI 48-76]) of 51 patients receiving higher dose luspatercept concentrations (0·75-1·75 mg/kg) achieved HI-E versus two (22% [95% CI 3-60]) of nine receiving lower dose concentrations (0·125-0·5 mg/kg). Three treatment-related grade 3 adverse events occurred in one patient each: myalgia (one [2%]), increased blast cell count (one [2%]), and general physical health deterioration (one [2%]). Two of these treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were reversible serious grade 3 adverse events: one patient (2%) had myalgia and one patient (2%) had general physical health deterioration.INTERPRETATION: Luspatercept was well tolerated and effective for the treatment of anaemia in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and so could therefore provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of anaemia associated with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes; further studies are ongoing.FUNDING: Acceleron Pharma.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting up-regulated profibrotic pathways, such as imatinib mesylate, have been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for patients with scGVHD. Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI with a well-established safety and efficacy profile in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, who are refractory or intolerant to imatinib, has also shown potent antifibrotic effects. We present here the first direct clinical evidence, from 3 patients treated in a small single-center series, suggesting that dasatinib can be a therapeutic option for patients with severe scGVHD resistant or intolerant to imatinib. All patients achieved partial response, with improvement in scGHVD target organs severity, joint mobility, lung impairment, and deep fibrotic lesions. This clinical response has remained stable or continued to improve after a median of 22 months (20-25) on dasatinib treatment, with very good tolerance. In addition, corticosteroids could be discontinued or significantly reduced in all patients. This clinical evidence suggests that dasatinib could be a safe and effective alternative for scGVHD patients refractory to corticosteroids and resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Based on these preliminary findings, and in order to address appropriate patient selection, time of intervention, and choice of drug, future larger studies should more formally establish the efficacy and safety of second-generation TKI for the treatment of scGVHD."

Here, we report the case of a child with Ph+ all who had persistent elevation of mrd, but no evidence of hematologic relapse while receiving imatinib plus intensive chemotherapy. Dasatinib was substituted for imatinib because no suitable donor for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (hsct) was available. Less-intensive chemotherapy with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine was administered concomitantly. No serious adverse events were encountered. With continuous dasatinib combined with chemotherapy, but no allogeneic hsct, our patient reached complete molecular remission and has been in complete molecular remission for more than 13 months. This report is the first about the long-term use of dasatinib in patients with Ph+ all and mrd elevation but hematologic remission during imatinib chemotherapy.

When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5 promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that GRG5 has pleiotropic roles in stem cell biology functioning as a stemness factor and a neural fate specifier."

In vivo studies were conducted in an intraperitoneal metastatic mouse model using SKOV-3/f-Luc cells. LB100 sensitized ovarian carcinoma lines to cisplatin-mediated cell death. Sensitization via LB100 was mediated by abrogation of cell-cycle arrest induced by cisplatin. Loss of the cisplatin-induced checkpoint correlated with decreased Wee1 expression, increased cdc2 activation, and increased mitotic entry (p-histone H3). LB100 also induced constitutive hyperphosphorylation of DDR proteins (BRCA1, Chk2, and γH2AX), altered the chronology and persistence of JNK activation, and modulated the expression of 14-3-3 binding sites. In vivo, cisplatin sensitization via LB100 significantly enhanced tumor growth inhibition and prevented disease progression after treatment cessation. Our results suggest that LB100 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo by modulation of the DDR pathway and cell-cycle checkpoint abrogation."

There is a disparity between research results and observed empirical effects seen in human astronaut crews, likely due to the numerous factors that limit terrestrial simulation of the complex space environment and extrapolation of human clinical consequences from varied animal models. Given the intended future of human spaceflight, with efforts now to rapidly expand capabilities for human missions to the moon and Mars, there is a pressing need to improve upon the understanding of the space radiation risk, predict likely clinical outcomes of interplanetary radiation exposure, and develop appropriate and effective mitigation strategies for future missions. To achieve this goal, the space radiation and aerospace community must recognize the historical limitations of radiation research and how such limitations could be addressed in future research endeavors. We have sought to highlight the numerous factors that limit understanding of the risk of space radiation for human crews and to identify ways in which these limitations could be addressed for improved understanding and appropriate risk posture regarding future human spaceflight."

					"context": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Apolipoprotein (apo) C-III is a key player in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism and strongly associated with elevated plasma triglyceride levels. Several new studies added important insights on apoC-III and its physiological function confirming its promise as a valid therapeutic target.RECENT FINDINGS: APOC3 is expressed in liver and intestine and regulates triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) catabolism and anabolism. The transcriptional regulation in both organs requires different regulatory elements. Clinical and preclinical studies established that apoC-III raises plasma triglyceride levels predominantly by inhibiting hepatic TRL clearance. Mechanistic insights into missense variants indicate accelerated renal clearance of apoC-III variants resulting in enhanced TRL catabolism. In contrast, an APOC3 gain-of-function variant enhances de novo lipogenesis and hepatic TRL production. Multiple studies confirmed the correlation between increased apoC-III levels and cardiovascular disease. This has opened up new therapeutic avenues allowing targeting of specific apoC-III properties in triglyceride metabolism.SUMMARY: Novel in vivo models and APOC3 missense variants revealed unique mechanisms by which apoC-III inhibits TRL catabolism. Clinical trials with Volanesorsen, an APOC3 antisense oligonucleotide, report very promising lipid-lowering outcomes. However, future studies will need to address if acute apoC-III lowering will have the same clinical benefits as a life-long reduction."

The survey included questions about patients' experiences before and after volanesorsen treatment.RESULTS: Twenty-two respondents had received volanesorsen for a median of 222 days. Volanesorsen significantly reduced the number of symptoms per patient across physical, emotional, and cognitive domains. Significant reductions from baseline were reported for steatorrhea, pancreatic pain, and constant worry about an attack of pain/AP. Respondents reported that volanesorsen improved overall management of symptoms and reduced interference of FCS with work/school responsibilities. Reductions in the negative impact of FCS on personal, social, and professional life were also reported.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with volanesorsen has the potential to reduce disease burden in patients with FCS through modulation of multiple symptom domains."

The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the effect of fish omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on apo C-III levels.METHODS: Randomized placebo-controlled trials investigating the impact of omega-3 on apo C-III levels were searched in PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar. A random-effects model and generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method. A weighted random-effects meta-regression was performed to evaluate the impact of potential confounders on glycemic parameters.RESULTS: This meta-analysis comprising 2062 subjects showed a significant reduction of apo C-III concentrations following treatment with omega-3 (WMD: -22.18 mg/L, 95% confidence interval: -31.61, -12.75, p < .001; I2: 88.24%). Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction of plasma apo C-III concentrations by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl esters but not omega-3 carboxylic acids or omega-3 ethyl esters. There was a greater apo C-III reduction with only EPA as compared with supplements containing EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or only DHA. A positive association between the apo C-III-lowering effect of omega-3 with baseline apo C-III concentrations and treatment duration was found.CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis has shown that omega-3 PUFAs might significantly decrease apo C-III.

					"context": "Although elevated serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is without any doubts accepted as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the role of elevated triglycerides (TGs)-rich lipoproteins as an independent risk factor has until recently been quite controversial. Recent data strongly suggest that elevated TG-rich lipoproteins are an independent risk factor for CVD and that therapeutic targeting of them could possibly provide further benefit in reducing CVD morbidity, events and mortality, apart from LDL-C lowering. Today elevated TGs are treated with lifestyle interventions, and with fibrates which could be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. There are also some new drugs. Volanesorsen, is an antisense oligonucleotid that inhibits the production of the Apo C-III which is crucial in regulating TGs metabolism because it inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase activity but also hepatic uptake of TGs-rich particles. Evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and it seems that it can substantially lower elevated TGs levels because ANGPTL3 also regulates TGs metabolism. Pemafibrate is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator which also decreases TGs, and improves other lipid parameters. It seems that it also has some other possible antiatherogenic effects. Alipogene tiparvovec is a nonreplicating adeno-associated viral vector that delivers copies of the LPL gene to muscle tissue which accelerates the clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins thus decreasing extremely high TGs levels. Pradigastat is a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor which substantially reduces extremely high TGs levels and appears to be promising in treatment of the rare familial chylomicronemia syndrome."

					"context": "An elevated serum level of LDL cholesterol is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the role of elevated triglyceride levels is debated. Controversies regarding hypertriglyceridaemia as an independent risk factor for CVD have occurred partly because elevated triglyceride levels are often a component of atherogenic dyslipidaemia - they are associated with decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and increased levels of small dense LDL particles, which are highly atherogenic. Findings from several large studies indicate that elevated levels of triglycerides (either fasting or nonfasting) or, more specifically, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, are independently associated with increased risk of CVD. Possible mechanisms for this association include excessive free fatty acid release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors, and impairment of fibrinolysis. Therapeutic targeting of hypertriglyceridaemia could, therefore, reduce CVD and cardiovascular events, beyond the reduction achieved by LDL-cholesterol lowering. Elevated triglyceride levels are reduced with lifestyle interventions and fibrates, which can be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. Some new drugs are on the horizon, such as volanesorsen (which targets apolipoprotein C-III), pemafibrate, and others. However, CVD outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have produced inconsistent results, meaning that no convincing evidence is available that lowering triglycerides by any approach can reduce mortality."

The Medical Outcome Survey Short Form 20 with an additional question for fatigue was used to assess health status. The SLICC/ACR damage index with a supplementary oral section was used to assess end organ damage. For statistical analysis, logistic regression analysis, Fisher's exact test, and Kruskal-Wallis rank tests were applied.RESULTS: Patients in all 3 groups had reduced quality of life with respect to all aspects of functional status and well being. There was no difference between the groups. In the primary SS group, the greatest damage was in the oral section (62% of patients). The patients with SLE and SS had the greatest renal, peripheral vascular, and musculoskeletal damage (24, 19, 38% of patients, respectively) followed by the SLE group. Ocular damage was more common in the primary SS group, but that was due to older age in this group. Malignancy was most common in the primary SS group (11%). Other organ damage scores did not differ between groups.CONCLUSION: End organ damage is uncommon in primary SS (with the exception of oral damage), but the degree of functional ability is as great as in SLE."

Patients received belimumab every four weeks plus SoC. SLICC Damage Index (SDI) values were assessed every 48 weeks (study years) following belimumab initiation (baseline). The primary endpoint was change in SDI from baseline at study years 5-6. Incidences of adverse events (AEs) were reported for the entire study period.RESULTS: The modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population comprised 998 patients. At baseline, 940 (94.2%) were female, mean (SD) age was 38.7 (11.49) years, and disease duration was 6.7 (6.24) years. The mean (SD) SELENA-SLEDAI and SDI scores were 8.2 (4.18) and 0.7 (1.19), respectively; 411 (41.2%) patients had organ damage (SDI = 1: 235 (23.5%); SDI ≥ 2: 176 (17.6%)) prior to belimumab.

Of patients without organ damage at baseline, 211/241 (87.6%) had no change in SDI and the mean change (SD) in SDI was +0.2 (0.44). Of patients with organ damage at baseline, 132/162 (81.5%) had no change in SDI and the mean (SD) change in SDI was +0.2 (0.53). The probability of not having a worsening in SDI score was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.91) and 0.75 (0.67, 0.81) in those without and with baseline damage, respectively (post hoc analysis).Drug-related AEs were reported for 433 (43.4%) patients; infections/infestations (282, 28.3%) and gastrointestinal disorders (139, 13.9%) were the most common.CONCLUSION: Patients with SLE treated with long-term belimumab plus SoC had a low incidence of organ damage accrual and no unexpected AEs.

					"context": "Despite early positive response to platinum-based chemotherapy, the majority of ovarian carcinomas develop resistance and progress to fatal disease. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitous phosphatase involved in the regulation of DNA-damage response (DDR) and cell-cycle checkpoint pathways. Recent studies have shown that LB100, a small-molecule inhibitor of PP2A, sensitizes cancer cells to radiation-mediated DNA damage. We hypothesized that LB100 could sensitize ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. We performed in vitro studies in SKOV-3, OVCAR-8, and PEO1, -4, and -6 ovarian cancer lines to assess cytotoxicity potentiation, cell-death mechanism(s), cell-cycle regulation, and DDR signaling. In vivo studies were conducted in an intraperitoneal metastatic mouse model using SKOV-3/f-Luc cells. LB100 sensitized ovarian carcinoma lines to cisplatin-mediated cell death. Sensitization via LB100 was mediated by abrogation of cell-cycle arrest induced by cisplatin. Loss of the cisplatin-induced checkpoint correlated with decreased Wee1 expression, increased cdc2 activation, and increased mitotic entry (p-histone H3). LB100 also induced constitutive hyperphosphorylation of DDR proteins (BRCA1, Chk2, and γH2AX), altered the chronology and persistence of JNK activation, and modulated the expression of 14-3-3 binding sites. In vivo, cisplatin sensitization via LB100 significantly enhanced tumor growth inhibition and prevented disease progression after treatment cessation.

					"context": "Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is continuously being damaged by endogenous processes such as metabolism or by exogenous events such as radiation. The specific phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine residue 139, described as γ-H2AX, is an excellent indicator or marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The yield of γ-H2AX (foci) is shown to have some correlation with the dose of radiation or other DSB-causing agents. However, there is some discrepancy in the DNA DSB foci yield among imaging and other methods such as gel electrophoresis. Super-resolution imaging techniques are now becoming widely used as essential tools in biology and medicine, after a slow uptake of their development almost two decades ago. Here we compare several super-resolution techniques used to image and determine the amount and spatial distribution of γ-H2AX foci formation after X-ray irradiation: stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground-state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return (GSDIM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM), as well as an improved confocal, Airyscan and HyVolution 2. We show that by using these super-resolution imaging techniques with as low as 30-nm resolution, each focus may be further resolved, thus increasing the number of foci per radiation dose compared to standard microscopy. Furthermore, the DNA repair proteins 53BP1 (after low-LET irradiations) and Ku70/Ku80 (from laser microbeam irradiation) do not always yield a significantly increased number of foci when imaged by the super-resolution techniques, suggesting that γ-H2AX, 53PB1 and Ku70/80 repair proteins do not fully co-localize on the units of higher order chromatin structure."

					"context": "Background: The colon and rectum are continuously exposed to oxidative stress that generates reactive oxygen species, which are a major cause of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Furthermore, chronic inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis (UC) are characterized by an excess of reactive nitrogen species that can also lead to DNA double-strand breakage and genomic instability. We investigated the expression of the nuclear casein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1 (NUCKS1) protein in UC and sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) due to its involvement in both DNA double-strand break repair and inflammatory signaling.Methods: NUCKS1 expression and expression of the DNA double-strand break marker gamma-H2AX (γH2AX) were assessed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded UC and CRC patient biopsies using peroxidase immunohistochemistry. Expression levels for both proteins were evaluated together with previously published expression-level data for hTERT and TP53 proteins in the same material.Results: Nondysplastic UC lesions had 10-fold lower γH2AX expression and approximately 4-fold higher NUCKS1 expression compared with sporadic CRC, indicating minimal DNA DSB damage and heightened DNA DSB repair in these lesions, respectively. NUCKS1 expression in UC tended to decrease with increasing grades of dysplasia, whereas γH2AX, hTERT, and TP53 expression tended to increase with increasing grades of dysplasia. The highest γH2AX expression was seen in sporadic CRC, indicating considerable DNA DSB damage, whereas the highest NUCKS1 expression and hTERT expression were seen in nondysplastic UC.Conclusions: Overall, our data suggest that NUCKS1 may be involved in DNA DSB repair and/or inflammatory signaling in UC, but a more thorough investigation of both pathways in UC is warranted."

					"context": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF) with limited treatment options. It is known that liver regeneration following APAP-induced ALF is a deciding factor in the final outcome. Previous studies from our laboratory using an incremental dose model involving a regenerating (300 mg/kg, APAP300) and a nonregenerating (600 mg/kg, APAP600) dose of APAP in mice have revealed several proregenerative pathways that regulate regeneration after APAP overdose. Here we report that DNA damage and repair mechanisms regulate initiation of liver regeneration following APAP overdose. Mice treated with nonregenerating APAP600 dose showed prolonged expression of pH2AX, a marker of the DNA double-strand break (DSB), compared with APAP300. In regenerating APAP300 dose-treated mice, H2AX was rapidly dephosphorylated at Tyr142, indicating timely DNA repair. Expression of several DNA repair proteins was substantially lower with APAP600. Poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) activation, involved in DNA repair, was significantly higher in the APAP300 group compared to the APAP600 group. Activation of p53, the major cell cycle checkpoint protein, was significantly higher with APAP600 as demonstrated by substantially higher expression of its target genes. Taken together, these data show that massive DNA DSB occurs in high-dose APAP toxicity, and lack of prompt DSB repair after APAP overdose leads to prolonged growth arrest and proliferative senescence, resulting in inhibited liver regeneration."

The goal of this review was to organize and summarize the clinical trials evaluating PARP inhibitor therapy in ovarian cancer as monotherapy, maintenance therapy after partial or complete remission to therapy or as a part of a combination regimen.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, data from the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and proceedings from scientific conferences were searched for published and unpublished data pertaining to clinical trials and approvals of PARP inhibitor use in ovarian cancer.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: There have been 36 published phase 1, 2 and 3 studies evaluating the use of olaparib, niraparib, veliparib and rucaparib in ovarian cancer. Olaparib and rucaparib have been approved by the US FDA as monotherapy for advanced recurrent ovarian cancer. Niraparib and olaparib have been approved by the US FDA for maintenance therapy after partial or complete remission in recurrent ovarian cancer. There are currently ten phase 3 trials evaluating PARP inhibitors at various timepoints in ovarian cancer therapy including at the time of primary adjuvant therapy, as maintenance therapy after primary chemotherapy, as monotherapy for recurrent cancer and as maintenance therapy after chemotherapy for recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: The landscape of PARP inhibitor use for ovarian cancer is rapidly evolving and PARP inhibitors have become more available as a targeted therapy option for ovarian cancer treatment."

In this review, I describe the rationale behind current PARP combination clinical trials with chemotherapies, angiogenesis inhibitors, cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors, and inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AK thymoma/mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway.RECENT FINDINGS: PARP inhibitors have primarily been studied as monotherapy in cancers with homologous recombination repair defects based on an early understanding of PARP-1 as a base excision repair enzyme and the idea that abrogation of two DNA repair pathways cripples rapidly dividing cancer cells. It is now known that PARP-1 is a DNA damage sensor with much wider reaching roles in DNA repair processes and normal cellular functions, opening possibilities for PARP inhibitor use in other clinical contexts.SUMMARY: PARP inhibitor combination clinical trials are in the early stages, but will deepen our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms, cancer biology, and targeted therapies, thus contributing to the next iteration of therapeutic options for our patients."

In this open-label crossover study, we evaluated the effects of food on niraparib pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety.METHODS: Patients received a single 300-mg dose of niraparib either after a high-fat meal or under fasting conditions. After a 7-day PK assessment, all patients received a second 300-mg dose of niraparib under the opposite condition, followed by 7-day PK assessment. Blood samples for PK analyses were collected at baseline (on days 1 and 8) and up to 168 h post-dose. Bioequivalence between conditions was defined by the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to last measurable concentration (AUC0-last) and from 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞) being within the 80-125% range.RESULTS: The high-fat meal/fasting ratios of geometric least-squares means for AUC0-last and AUC0-∞ were 106.8 (90% CI 97.8-116.6) and 110.1 (90% CI 99.7-121.6), respectively, indicating bioequivalence between conditions. Mean half-life, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and time to Cmax after the high-fat meal were similar to, 27% smaller than, and 128% greater than after fasting, respectively. Adverse events were similar between conditions.CONCLUSIONS: A high-fat meal did not impact the PK profile of niraparib, indicating that niraparib can be taken with or without food. Niraparib was safe and well-tolerated."

					"context": "Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) that is critically involved in many biological processes that are linked to cell stress responses. It is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In particular, PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is activated upon sensing nicked DNA. Once activated, PARP1 is responsible for the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage response mechanisms. This observation provided the rationale for developing PARP1 inhibitors for the treatment of human malignancies. Indeed, three PARP1 inhibitors (Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib) have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Moreover, in 2017, both Olaparib and Niraparib have also been approved for the treatment of fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Despite this very exciting progress in the clinic, the basic signaling mechanism that connects PARP1 to a diverse array of biological processes is still poorly understood. This is, in large part, due to the inherent technical difficulty associated with the analysis of protein PARylation, which is a low-abundance, labile, and heterogeneous PTM. The study of PARylation has been greatly facilitated by the recent advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies tailored to the analysis of this modification. In this Perspective, we discuss these breakthroughs, including their technical development, and applications that provide a global view of the many biological processes regulated by this important protein modification."

The mechanisms of action of niraparib include inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity as well as increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes through \"trapping\" the PARP enzyme on damaged DNA. Phase I and III studies have demonstrated activity and benefit of niraparib in both BRCA mutated (BRCAm) and BRCA wild-type (BRCAwt) cancers. Phase I testing of niraparib established the maximally tolerated dose of 300mg by mouth (PO) daily, and the phase 3 ENGOT-OV16/NOVA study demonstrated the benefit of niraparib maintenance therapy compared to placebo after completion of and response to platinum-based chemotherapy in both BRCAm and BRCAwt ovarian cancer patient populations. Toxicities seen with niraparib include hematologic, gastrointestinal, fatigue, and cardiovascular. Hematologic toxicities include thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia and leukopenia; upfront dose modification to 200mg niraparib for patients with baseline weight of ≤77kg and/or baseline platelets of ≤150,000K/uL should be considered to avoid significant hematologic toxicity, especially thrombocytopenia, based on recent analyses of the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA study. Cardiovascular toxicities include hypertension, tachycardia, as well as palpitations, and patients should be monitored for hypertension. PARP inhibitors have been associated with low risks of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and the overall risk of AML and MDS is 0.9% of all patients treated with niraparib. Niraparib testing is ongoing in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients as maintenance therapy following completion of platinum-based chemotherapy, in BRCAwt cancers as treatment, as well as in combinations with other biologic drugs such as immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic agents."

These escape genes have been reported to be under stronger purifying selection than other X-linked genes. Although it is known that escape from X-inactivation is much more common in humans than in mice, systematic assays of escape in humans have to date employed only interspecies somatic cell hybrids. Here we provide the first systematic next-generation sequencing analysis of escape in a human cell line. We analyzed RNA and genotype sequencing data obtained from B lymphocyte cell lines derived from Europeans (CEU) and Yorubans (YRI). By replicated detection of heterozygosis in the transcriptome, we identified 114 escaping genes, including 76 not previously known to be escapees.

There is an excess of escaping genes associated with mental retardation, consistent with this being a common phenotype of polyX phenotypes. We find both differences between populations and between individuals in the propensity to escape. Indeed, we provide the first evidence for there being both hyper- and hypo-escapee females in the human population, consistent with the highly variable phenotypic presentation of polyX karyotypes. Considering also prior data, we reclassify genes as being always, never, and sometimes escape genes. We fail to replicate the prior claim that genes that escape X-inactivation are under stronger purifying selection than others."

One patient stopped treatment after one dose because of an acute infection and was reenrolled after recovery; each course was analyzed as a separate patient entry. Two patients had dose-limiting toxicity (reversible increases in serum creatinine or calculated serum creatinine clearance) at the 3.1 mg/m2 level. Probable or possible study drug-related grade 3 adverse events occurred in 6 (20.7%) patients [anemia (n = 2), decreased creatinine clearance, dyspnea, hyponatremia, and lymphopenia]. Ten (50%) of 20 response-evaluable patients had stable disease for four or more cycles. One patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma had a partial response noted after 10 cycles, which was maintained for five additional cycles. The other patients achieving stable disease had one of the following: fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, thymoma, atypical carcinoid of lung, or ovarian, testicular, breast (n = 2), and prostate cancer. The recommended phase II dose of LB-100 is 2.33 mg/m2 daily for 3 days every 3 weeks.Conclusions: The safety, tolerability, preliminary evidence of antitumor activity, and novel mechanism of action of LB-100 support its continued development alone and in combination with other therapies.

					"context": "OBJECTIVE Cavernous sinus hemangiomas (CSHs) are rare benign vascular tumors that arise from the dural venous sinuses lateral to the sella. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has emerged as a principal alternative to microresection for small- and medium-sized CSHs. Resection is a reasonable option for large (3-4 cm in diameter) and giant (> 4 cm in diameter) CSHs. However, management of giant CSHs remains a challenge for neurosurgeons because of the high rates of morbidity and even death that stem from uncontrollable and massive hemorrhage during surgery. The authors report here the results of their study on the use of hypofractionated SRS (H-SRS) to treat giant CSH. METHODS Between January 2008 and April 2014, 31 patients with a giant CSH (tumor volume > 40 cm3, > 4 cm in diameter) treated using CyberKnife radiosurgery were enrolled in a cohort study. Clinical status and targeted reduction of tumor volume were evaluated by means of serial MRI. The diagnosis for 27 patients was determined on the basis of typical imaging features. In 4 patients, the diagnosis of CSH was confirmed histopathologically. The median CSH volume was 64.4 cm3 (range 40.9-145.3 cm3). Three or 4 sessions of CyberKnife radiosurgery were used with a prescription dose based on the intent to cover the entire tumor with a higher dose while ensuring dose limitation to the visual pathways and brainstem. The median marginal dose to the tumor was 21 Gy (range 19.5-21 Gy) in 3 fractions for 11 patients and 22 Gy (range 18-22 Gy) in 4 fractions for 20 patients. RESULTS The median duration of follow-up was 30 months (range 6-78 months) for all patients. Follow-up MRI scans revealed a median tumor volume reduction of 88.1% (62.3%-99.4%) at last examination compared with the pretreatment volume. Ten patients developed new or aggravated temporary headache and 5 experienced vomiting during the treatment; these acute symptoms were relieved completely after steroid administration. Among the 30 patients with symptoms observed before treatment, 19 achieved complete symptomatic remission, and 11 had partial remission. One patient reported seizures, which were controlled after antiepileptic drug administration. No radiation-induced neurological deficits or delayed complications were reported during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Hypofractionated SRS was an effective and safe modality for treating giant CSH. Considering the risks involved with microsurgery, it is possible that H-SRS might be able to serve as a definitive primary treatment option for giant CSH."

Palbociclib is an oral inhibitor of CDK4/6, which leads to phosphorylation of RB1 and cell-cycle arrest. We conducted a two-arm study evaluating efficacy and tissue pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of palbociclib in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.METHODS: Eligibility criteria included confirmation of RB1 proficiency by IHC; ≤ 3 relapses; KPS ≥ 60; no limit on prior treatments. Arm 1 received palbociclib for 7 days prior to indicated resection followed by adjuvant palbociclib. Arm 2 received palbociclib without resection. Primary objective was PFS6; secondary included toxicity, OS, and ORR. Exploratory aims included biomarker assessment and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic effects in surgical patients.RESULTS: Total of 22 patients were enrolled; 6 on Arm 1 and 16 on Arm 2. Trial was stopped early secondary to lack of efficacy, with 95% of evaluable patients progressing within 6 months. Median PFS was 5.14 weeks (range 5 days-142 weeks) and median OS was 15.4 weeks (range 2-274 weeks). Two patients (10%) had related grade ≥ 3 AEs. In Arm 1, 5 patients had tissue concentrations of palbociclib felt to be sufficient for biological effect and paired samples available for RB1 IHC. There were no consistent changes in RB1 expression or cell proliferation in the paired tissue.CONCLUSION: In this trial, despite adequate tissue PK, palbociclib monotherapy was not an effective treatment for recurrent glioblastoma. However, these were heavily pretreated patients and targeting the CDK4/6 pathway may still deserve further exploration.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01227434."

					"context": "Current genome-wide ChIP-seq experiments on different epigenetic marks aim at unraveling the interplay between their regulation mechanisms. Published evaluation tools, however, allow testing for predefined hypotheses only. Here, we present a novel method for annotation-independent exploration of epigenetic data and their inter-correlation with other genome-wide features. Our method is based on a combinatorial genome segmentation solely using information on combinations of epigenetic marks. It does not require prior knowledge about the data (e.g. gene positions), but allows integrating the data in a straightforward manner. Thereby, it combines compression, clustering and visualization of the data in a single tool. Our method provides intuitive maps of epigenetic patterns across multiple levels of organization, e.g. of the co-occurrence of different epigenetic marks in different cell types. Thus, it facilitates the formulation of new hypotheses on the principles of epigenetic regulation. We apply our method to histone modification data on trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, 9 and 27 in multi-potent and lineage-primed mouse cells, analyzing their combinatorial modification pattern as well as differentiation-related changes of single modifications. We demonstrate that our method is capable of reproducing recent findings of gene centered approaches, e.g. correlations between CpG-density and the analyzed histone modifications. Moreover, combining the clustered epigenetic data with information on the expression status of associated genes we classify differences in epigenetic status of e.g. house-keeping genes versus differentiation-related genes. Visualizing the distribution of modification states on the chromosomes, we discover strong patterns for chromosome X. For example, exclusively H3K9me3 marked segments are enriched, while poised and active states are rare. Hence, our method also provides new insights into chromosome-specific epigenetic patterns, opening up new questions how \"epigenetic computation\" is distributed over the genome in space and time."

Parameters for the model were derived from HSC biologic data in the literature and from leukemia risks among atomic bomb survivors who were subjected to much lower radiation doses.RESULTS: Proliferating HSCs that migrate from sites distant from the high-dose region include few preleukemic HSCs, thus decreasing the high-dose leukemia risk.

					"context": "INTRODUCTION: An Amyand's hernia is a heterogeneous clinical condition defined by the presence of the vermiform appendix within an inguinal hernia sac, which may or may not contain other abdominal contents or pathologic inflammatory changes. Herein we present an exceptionally rare case of an Amyand's hernia containing acute appendicitis and a perforated cecum.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 46-year-old male with a right inguinal hernia of 2-3 year duration presented to our Emergency Department complaining of acute onset abdominal and groin pain. The patient was diagnosed with an incarcerated right inguinal hernia and underwent emergent surgical repair. Intraoperatively a reactive fluid was found within the hernia sac that prompted an exploratory laparotomy for suspected bowel perforation. The hernia was then found to contain an inflamed gangrenous appendix with an inflamed and perforated cecum. An ileocecectomy and enteroenterostomy was performed and the hernia defect was repaired without mesh.DISCUSSION: With an estimated incidence of only 1%, Amyand's hernias are rare and lack a clear evidence-based management scheme. Moreover, they can contain a diverse range of pathologic features and presentations that can complicate diagnosis and treatment. To avoid potential morbidity and mortality, the surgeon must consider an Amyand's hernia on his or her differential when operating on inguinal hernias and be aware of the associated presentations, complications, and management schemes.CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of reports describing simultaneous appendicitis and cecal perforation within an Amyand's hernia. In our case, ileocecectomy and Bassini hernia repair with close follow-up led to a favorable outcome.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved."

					"context": "Intestinal epithelial cells are constantly stimulated by reactive oxidant metabolites (ROMs) in inflamed mucosa. Monochloramine (NH2Cl), a cell-permeant ROM, is particularly relevant to the pathogenesis of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Nuclear speckles, a unique nuclear subcompartment, accumulate a family of proteins, namely, serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins. They play important roles in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Currently, little is known about the link between inflammatory stimulation and the pre-mRNA splicing process, although gene expression is changed in inflamed tissues. The present study was designed to investigate whether stimulation of human colonic epithelial cells (HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines) with NH2Cl affects nuclear speckles and their components. By indirect immunofluorescence, nuclear speckles have been shown to undergo rapid aggregation after NH2Cl stimulation. By utilizing Western blotting, SRp30 (a subset of SR proteins) in intestinal epithelial cells was found to be phosphorylated after NH2Cl treatment, whereas other SR proteins were not responsive to NH2Cl stimulation. The cytotoxic effect of NH2Cl was excluded by both negative lactate dehydrogenase assay and propidium iodide staining. Therefore, NH2Cl-induced morphological changes on nuclear speckles and phosphorylated SRp30 do not result from intestinal epithelial injury. Furthermore, the effect of NH2Cl on nuclear speckles and SRp30 was blocked by bisindolylmaleimide I, a selective PKC inhibitor. Together, the available data suggest that stimulation of intestinal epithelial cells with NH2Cl results in a consequent change on pre-mRNA splicing machinery via a distinctive signal pathway involving activation of PKC. This effect may contribute to oxidant-induced pathophysiological changes in the gastrointestinal tract."

					"context": "A significant fraction of mRNAs are degraded by the nuclear exosome in normal cells. Here, we studied where and when these exosome target mRNAs are sorted away from properly exported ones in the cells. We show that upon exosome inactivation, polyA RNAs are apparently accumulated in nuclear foci that are distinct from nuclear speckles (NSs), and provide several lines of evidence supporting that these polyA RNAs mainly correspond to accumulating exosome target mRNAs. These results suggest that exosomal mRNA degradation mostly occurs outside of NSs. In support of this possibility, targeting exosome target mRNAs to NSs stabilizes them by preventing exosomal degradation. Furthermore, inhibiting mRNA release from NSs does not attenuate exosomal degradation in normal cells, and results in polyA RNA accumulation both inside and outside of NSs in exosome inactivated cells, suggesting that passage through NSs is not required for sorting mRNAs for degradation or export. Indeed, exosome target mRNAs that normally do not enter NSs are exported upon exosome inactivation. Together, our data suggest that exosome target mRNAs are mainly degraded in the nucleoplasm before entering NSs and rapid removal of these mRNAs is important for preventing their nuclear export."

In this study, we unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export. Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear pores, is not. Upon NXF1 depletion, the TREX protein UAP56 loses speckle concentration but coaccumulates with intronless mRNAs and polyA RNAs in the nucleoplasm, and these RNAs are trapped in NSs upon UAP56 codepletion. We propose that the export-competent messenger RNP assembly mainly occurs in NSs for intronless mRNAs and that entering NSs serves as a quality control step in mRNA export."

Dietary ALA significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of the interleukin 1 β (IL-1β), IL-6, IFN-γ, and LITAF genes compared with the other groups during oxidative stress by DEX. In conclusion, this study suggests that in broilers, ALA is more effective for normalizing the oxidative stress induced by DEX than vitamin C or vitamin E."

To elucidate the influence of l-arginine on the activation of endogenous antioxidant defence, male Wistar rats were orally administered daily with l-arginine at different levels of 25, 50, 100 mg/100 g body weight. After 7 and 14 days feeding, the antioxidative capacities and glutathione (GSH) contents in the plasma and in the liver were uniformly enhanced with the increasing consumption of l-arginine, whereas the oxidative stress was effectively suppressed by l-arginine treatment. After 14 days feeding, the mRNA levels and protein expressions of Keap1 and Cul3 were gradually reduced by increasing l-arginine intake, resulting that the nuclear factor Nrf2 was activated. Upon activation of Nrf2, the expressions of antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-dependent genes and proteins (GCLC, GCLM, GS, GR, GST, GPx, CAT, SOD, NQO1, HO-1) were up-regulated by l-arginine feeding, indicating an upward trend in antioxidant capacity uniformly with the increasing consumption of l-arginine. The present study demonstrates that the supplementation of l-arginine stimulates GSH synthesis and activates Nrf2 pathway, leading to the up-regulation of ARE-driven antioxidant expressions via Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. Results suggest the availability of l-arginine is a critical factor to suppress oxidative stress and induce an endogenous antioxidant response."

These lesions may be found incidentally or owing to signs and symptoms that they produce, such as an enlarging pulsatile mass, headache, tinnitus, or bleeding. These lesions often constitute high-flow arterial blood from the superficial temporal or occipital arteries with venous outflow into extracranial venous structures.METHODS: We describe diagnosis and management of 2 cases of congenital scalp arteriovenous malformations in adolescent patients. One case had more typical vascular supply and outflow, whereas the other case demonstrated more uncommon arterial blood supply from extracranial ophthalmic arteries as well as a component of transosseous venous drainage into the intracranial superior sagittal sinus via emissary veins.RESULTS: Treatment of these lesions usually consists of endovascular embolization followed by surgical resection.CONCLUSIONS: Both scalp AVMs described were successfully excised after transvenous embolization.

A 14-yr-old male presented with a pulsatile scalp lesion that was first noticed 3 yr prior and had progressively enlarged. No history of trauma was reported. MRI demonstrated a 4 cm wide and 2 cm tall nidus and catheter angiography was performed to further define the vascular supply and drainage. The patient underwent transvenous endovascular embolization followed by surgical excision via a bicoronal incision, as shown in this operative video. Care was taken to identify, cauterize, and transect feeding vessels from the superficial temporal, supratrochlear, and supraorbital arteries circumferentially to completely devascularize and resect the galeal nidus from overlying scalp tissue and underlying pericranium. Previously unreported in the literature, transosseous emissary veins partially draining the lesion were noted on angiography and were waxed thoroughly during surgery. Six-month follow-up examination demonstrated a well-healed incision without evidence of AVM recurrence. The unique venous drainage of this cirsoid aneurysm highlights the value of diagnostic angiography to fully characterize these rare and complex vascular lesions prior to pursuing definitive treatment.  IRB approval was obtained from the Ann & Robert H.

A colour Doppler ultrasound test and magnetic resonance angiography revealed a high-flow scalp arteriovenous fistula with a feeder vessel from the distal superficial temporal artery, which drained into the corresponding, dilated, tortuous vein. The patient underwent diagnostic digital subtraction angiography. This was followed by transarterial embolisation of the fistula using a 50 per cent mixture of n-butyl cyanoacrylate glue and Lipiodol®, with manual distal venous occlusion. A successful outcome was achieved with instant relief of symptoms.CONCLUSION: Cirsoid aneurysms of the facial region, an uncommon cause of tinnitus, can be effectively managed by endovascular embolisation. This treatment obviates the need for surgery, which is associated with an increased risk of complications such as scarring, deformity and bleeding."

These lesions are difficult to manage because of their complex vascular anatomy, high shunt flow and cosmetic disfigurement. We report our experience in the surgical management of these lesions.METHODS: We treated 11 patients with cirsoid aneurysms surgically. All except one patient were males who were in the second and third decades of life. History of trauma was present in 6 patients. In one patient, the lesion had been present since birth. Occipital and frontal regions were the sites commonly involved. Superficial temporal, occipital and posterior auricular arteries were the most frequent feeding arteries. The size ranged from 3 cms to 12 cms. Following investigations were done: CT, MRI, MRA, angiography and Doppler studies.FINDINGS: Excision of the lesion was done in 8 patients and en bloc resection of the lesion with the scalp with reconstruction was done in the remaining three. One among the three patients who underwent en bloc resection had undergone prior surgery. None of the patients underwent preoperative endovascular treatment. One patient had undergone intralesional injection of sclerosing agents twice. Superficial scalp necrosis occurred in two patients but was treated successfully. All the patients except one had good cosmetic results and there was no recurrence during an average follow up of 18 months.INTERPRETATION: Surgical excision with good cosmetic results is feasible in patients with cirsoid aneurysms."

Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance of TIA-1-positive stress granules in arsenite-treated cells are inhibited by TPEN. In addition, Zn2+ is released in cells treated with arsenite, before stress granule formation. These findings suggest that Zn2+ is a physiological ligand of TIA-1, acting as a stress-inducible second messenger to promote multimerization of TIA-1 and subsequent localization into stress granules."

This has allowed identification of asymptomatic mutation carriers, which may be of help in understanding the molecular changes preceding disease onset.OBJECTIVES: We studied the cellular expression of FUS protein and the effect of heat-shock- and dithiothreitol-induced stress in fibroblasts from FUS P525L mutation carriers, healthy controls, and patients with sporadic ALS.METHODS: Western blots and immunocytochemistry were performed to study the subcellular localization of FUS protein. Control and stressed cells were double stained with FUS and the stress marker TIA-R.RESULTS: Fibroblasts from healthy controls and sporadic ALS cases showed a prominent nuclear FUS expression. In the 2 FUS P525L mutation carriers, instead, most cells showed a protein localization in both nucleus and cytoplasm, or exclusively in the cytoplasm. Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic FUS was recruited into stress granules, which showed a time-dependent decrease in all subjects. However, in the FUS P525L fibroblasts, the granules persisted longer, and they were more numerous than those detected in the cells from controls and sporadic ALS patients.CONCLUSIONS: We show that in fibroblasts of FUS P525L mutation carriers, FUS mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it redistributed into stress granules with likely a dose effect, i.e. a higher number of cells with granules, which persist longer, than in controls and ALS cases. These data represent an early molecular change occurring before ALS onset, suggesting a transient preaggregative state.© 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel."

However, the exact function of this punctate pattern in cytoplasm during EV71 infection remains unknown. In this study, we firstly have examined this punctate pattern of Sam68 re-localization in the cytoplasm, and observed the obvious recruitments of Sam68 to the EV71-induced stress granules (SGs). Sam68, belongs to the KH domain family of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), was then confirmed that its KH domain was essential for this recruitment. Nevertheless, Knockdown of Sam68 expression using ShRNA had no effects on SGs assembly, indicating that Sam68 is not a constitutive component of the SGs during EV71 infection. Lastly, we investigated the importance of microtubulin transport to SGs aggregation, and revealed that microtubule depolymerization inhibited SGs formation, suggesting that EV71-induced SGs move throughout the cytoplasm in a microtubule-dependent manner. Taken together, these results illuminated that EV71 infections can induce SGs formation, and Sam68, as a SGs component, migrates alone with SGs dependent on intact microtubule upon the viral infections. These findings may provide novel underlying mechanism for delineating the role of SGs during EV71 infection."

We further discovered that adenosine-uridine (AU)-rich element RNA binding factor 1 (AUF1), which can bind to mRNAs and regulate their translation, was recruited to the SGs in response to high dose of CVB3 by detecting the co-localization of AUF1 with SG markers. Similar results were also observed in the enterovirus 71 (EV71)-infected cells.

Nevertheless, editing plays a critical role in mammalian cells, as highlighted by the analysis of ADAR-null mutants. In particular, the long form of ADAR1 (ADAR1(p150)) is essential for viability. Moreover, a number of studies have implicated ADAR1(p150) in various stress pathways.

Moreover, we show that fusion of Zα(ADAR1) to either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or polypyrimidine binding protein 4 (PTB4) also results in their localization to stress granules. We additionally show that the Zα domain from other Z-DNA-binding proteins (ZBP1, E3L) is likewise sufficient for localization to stress granules.

Large FUS-immunoreactive inclusions fill the perikaryon of surviving motor neurons of ALS patients carrying mutations at post-mortem. This sequestration of FUS is predicted to disrupt RNA processing and initiate neurodegeneration. Here, we demonstrate that C-terminal ALS mutations disrupt the nuclear localizing signal (NLS) of FUS resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation in transfected cells and patient fibroblasts. FUS mislocalization is rescued by the addition of the wild-type FUS NLS to mutant proteins. We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS. While FUS interacts with itself directly by protein-protein interaction, the recruitment of FUS to stress granules and interaction with PABP are RNA dependent. These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration."

LB100, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, is closely related to IR. However, there is little data regarding its direct influence on NAFLD.AIM: To elucidate the effect and underlying mechanism of LB100 in NAFLD.METHODS: After 10 wk of high fat diet (HFD) feeding, male C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle or LB100 for an additional 6 wk (three times a week). The L02 cell line was treated with LB100 and free fatty acids (FFAs) for 24 h. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil red O staining were performed for histological examination. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expression of Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), total and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), and the proteins involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. The mRNA levels were determined by qPCR. Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK was performed to further examine the exact mechanism of LB100 in NAFLD.RESULTS: LB100 significantly ameliorated HFD-induced obesity, hepatic lipid accumulation and hepatic injury in mice. In addition, LB100 significantly downregulated the protein levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and its lipogenesis target genes, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and fatty acid synthase, and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α, acyl-CoA oxidase 1 and uncoupling protein 2, as well as the upstream mediators Sirt1 and AMPKα in the livers of HFD-fed mice. In vitro, LB100 alleviated FFA-induced lipid accumulation in L02 cells through the AMPK/Sirt1 signaling pathway. Further studies showed that the curative effect of LB100 on lipid accumulation was abolished by inhibiting AMPKα in L02 cells.CONCLUSION: PP2A inhibition by LB100 significantly ameliorates hepatic steatosis by regulating hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation via the AMPK/Sirt1 pathway. LB100 may be a potential therapeutic agent for NAFLD.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved."

Our results show that h-cNDs have remarkable free radical scavenging ability and preserve the enzymatic activity of catalase after γ-irradiation.

This property of detonation synthesized nanodiamonds is improved after carboxylation, which in turn influences changes in the hydrogen bond strength in water.

					"context": "To elucidate microscopic details of proton cancer therapy (PCT), we apply the simplest-level electron nuclear dynamics (SLEND) method to H+ + (H2O)1-6 at ELab = 100 keV. These systems are computationally tractable prototypes to simulate water radiolysis reactions-i.e. the PCT processes that generate the DNA-damaging species against cancerous cells. To capture incipient bulk-water effects, ten (H2O)1-6 isomers are considered, ranging from quasi-planar/multiplanar (H2O)1-6 to \"smallest-drop\" prism and cage (H2O)6 structures. SLEND is a time-dependent, variational, non-adiabatic and direct method that adopts a nuclear classical-mechanics description and an electronic single-determinantal wavefunction in the Thouless representation. Short-time SLEND/6-31G* (n = 1-6) and /6-31G** (n = 1-5) simulations render cluster-to-projectile 1-electron-transfer (1-ET) total integral cross sections (ICSs) and 1-ET probabilities. In absolute quantitative terms, SLEND/6-31G* 1-ET ICS compares satisfactorily with alternative experimental and theoretical results only available for n = 1 and exhibits almost the same accuracy of the best alternative theoretical result. SLEND/6-31G** overestimates 1-ET ICS for n = 1, but a comparable overestimation is also observed with another theoretical method. An investigation on H+ + H indicates that electron direct ionization (DI) becomes significant with the large virtual-space quasi-continuum in large basis sets; thus, SLEND/6-31G** 1-ET ICS is overestimated by DI contributions. The solution to this problem is discussed. In relative quantitative terms, both SLEND/6-31* and /6-31G** 1-ET ICSs precisely fit into physically justified scaling formulae as a function of the cluster size; this indicates SLEND's suitability for predicting properties of water clusters with varying size. Long-time SLEND/6-31G* (n = 1-4) simulations predict the formation of the DNA-damaging radicals H, OH, O and H3O. While \"smallest-drop\" isomers are included, no early manifestations of bulk water PCT properties are observed and simulations with larger water clusters will be needed to capture those effects. This study is the largest SLEND investigation on water radiolysis to date."

					"context": "BACKGROUND: Bundled care payments are increasingly being explored for neurosurgical interventions. In this setting, skilled nursing facility (SNF) is less desirable from a cost perspective than discharge to home, underscoring the need for better preoperative prediction of postoperative disposition.OBJECTIVE: To assess the capability of the Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool (RAPT) and other preoperative variables to determine expected disposition prior to surgery in a heterogeneous neurosurgical cohort, through observational study.METHODS: Patients aged 50 yr or more undergoing elective neurosurgery were enrolled from June 2016 to February 2017 (n = 623). Logistic regression was used to identify preoperative characteristics predictive of discharge disposition. Results from multivariate analysis were used to create novel grading scales for the prediction of discharge disposition that were subsequently compared to the RAPT Score using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis.RESULTS: Higher RAPT Score significantly predicted home disposition (P < .001). Age 65 and greater, dichotomized RAPT walk score, and spinal surgery below L2 were independent predictors of SNF discharge in multivariate analysis. A grading scale utilizing these variables had superior discriminatory power between SNF and home/rehab discharge when compared with RAPT score alone (P = .004).CONCLUSION: Our analysis identified age, lower lumbar/lumbosacral surgery, and RAPT walk score as independent predictors of discharge to SNF, and demonstrated superior predictive power compared with the total RAPT Score when combined in a novel grading scale. These tools may identify patients who may benefit from expedited discharge to subacute care facilities and decrease inpatient hospital resource utilization following surgery.Copyright © 2018 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons."

					"context": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of conventional factors, the Risk Assessment and Predictor Tool (RAPT) and performance-based functional tests as predictors of delayed recovery after total hip arthroplasty (THA).METHOD: A prospective cohort study in a regional hospital in the Netherlands with 315 patients was attending for THA in 2012. The dependent variable recovery of function was assessed with the Modified Iowa Levels of Assistance scale. Delayed recovery was defined as taking more than 3 days to walk independently. Independent variables were age, sex, BMI, Charnley score, RAPT score and scores for four performance-based tests [2-minute walk test, timed up and go test (TUG), 10-meter walking test (10 mW) and hand grip strength].RESULTS: Regression analysis with all variables identified older age (>70 years), Charnley score C, slow walking speed (10 mW >10.0 s) and poor functional mobility (TUG >10.5 s) as the best predictors of delayed recovery of function. This model (AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.91) performed better than a model with conventional factors and RAPT scores, and significantly better (p = 0.04) than a model with only conventional factors (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.87).CONCLUSIONS: The combination of performance-based tests and conventional factors predicted inpatient functional recovery after THA.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Two simple functional performance-based tests have a significant added value to a more conventional screening with age and comorbidities to predict recovery of functioning immediately after total hip surgery. Patients over 70 years old, with comorbidities, with a TUG score >10.5 s and a walking speed >1.0 m/s are at risk for delayed recovery of functioning. Those high risk patients need an accurate discharge plan and could benefit from targeted pre- and postoperative therapeutic exercise programs."

Multiple FUS gene mutations have been linked to hereditary forms, and aggregation of FUS protein is believed to play an important role in pathogenesis of these diseases. In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs). We demonstrated that disruption of motifs responsible for RNA recognition and binding not only prevents SG recruitment, but also dramatically increases the protein propensity to aggregate in the cell cytoplasm with formation of juxtanuclear structures displaying typical features of aggresomes. Functional RNA-binding domains from TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) fused to highly aggregation-prone C-terminally truncated FUS protein restored the ability to enter SGs and prevented aggregation of the chimeric protein. Truncated FUS was also able to trap endogenous FUS molecules in the cytoplasmic aggregates. Our data indicate that RNA binding and recruitment to SGs protect cytoplasmic FUS from aggregation, and loss of this protection may trigger its pathological aggregation in vivo."

We have demonstrated that, in leukaemic cells, P-glycoprotein expression is regulated at the translational level. More recently, we have shown that in cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein, MDR1 mRNA does not aggregate into translationally silent stress granules. Importantly, this is not unique for MDR1, since other transcripts encoding transmembrane proteins, and which are thus translated at the endoplasmic reticulum, follow the same pattern. By using a series of chimaeric transcripts, we have demonstrated that transcript localization at the endoplasmic reticulum bypasses the signals dictating stress granule sequestration. Polysome profile analyses and protein synthesis experiments indicate that, upon stress withdrawal, endoplasmic-reticulum-bound transcripts resume translation faster than those at the cytosol, which have been sequestered into stress granules. This may represent a novel mechanism by which drug-resistant cells respond quickly to stress, helping them to survive the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs."

We suggest stress granules are formed by a summation of protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions, with RNA self-assembly likely to contribute to other RNP assemblies wherever there is a high local concentration of RNA. RNA assembly in vitro is also increased by GR and PR dipeptide repeats, which are known to increase stress granule formation in cells.

					"context": "BACKGROUND: Deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures (DOORS) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of unknown cause. We aimed to identify the genetic basis of this syndrome by sequencing most coding exons in affected individuals.METHODS: Through a search of available case studies and communication with collaborators, we identified families that included at least one individual with at least three of the five main features of the DOORS syndrome: deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, intellectual disability, and seizures. Participants were recruited from 26 centres in 17 countries. Families described in this study were enrolled between Dec 1, 2010, and March 1, 2013. Collaborating physicians enrolling participants obtained clinical information and DNA samples from the affected child and both parents if possible. We did whole-exome sequencing in affected individuals as they were enrolled, until we identified a candidate gene, and Sanger sequencing to confirm mutations. We did expression studies in human fibroblasts from one individual by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, and in mouse tissues by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR.FINDINGS: 26 families were included in the study. We did exome sequencing in the first 17 enrolled families; we screened for TBC1D24 by Sanger sequencing in subsequent families. We identified TBC1D24 mutations in 11 individuals from nine families (by exome sequencing in seven families, and Sanger sequencing in two families). 18 families had individuals with all five main features of DOORS syndrome, and TBC1D24 mutations were identified in half of these families. The seizure types in individuals with TBC1D24 mutations included generalised tonic-clonic, complex partial, focal clonic, and infantile spasms. Of the 18 individuals with DOORS syndrome from 17 families without TBC1D24 mutations, eight did not have seizures and three did not have deafness. In expression studies, some mutations abrogated TBC1D24 mRNA stability. We also detected Tbc1d24 expression in mouse phalangeal chondrocytes and calvaria, which suggests a role of TBC1D24 in skeletogenesis.INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that mutations in TBC1D24 seem to be an important cause of DOORS syndrome and can cause diverse phenotypes.

Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the evidence. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. We found one cross-sectional study, one analytic cohort study and two case-control studies relating to our question. The number of participants ranged from 886-12 514. Two studies were conducted in children and two other studies in children and adults. It was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis. We identified low to very low-quality evidence that KI administration after a nuclear accident resulted in a reduction of the risk of thyroid cancer in children; however, the KI administration and dose was not well described in the studies. None of the studies investigated the effects of KI administration in the case of a nuclear accident on hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. Low to very low-quality evidence suggests that KI intake following a nuclear accident may reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in children. No conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of KI intake with respect to the prevention of hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules."

					"context": "Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not against other radionuclides. Iodine prophylaxis can be a relevant countermeasure in Norway and will be implemented according to recommendations from the Crisis Committee for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies. The Chernobyl accident confirmed that the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer is much higher for foetuses and children and adolescents under 18 years. An epidemiological study showed that intake of iodine tablets could reduce the risk for thyroid cancer by a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other radionuclides that may be released. Based on the present risk assessment in Norway, iodine tablets have been distributed to the counties north of Salten. In addition, there is an emergency stockpile of iodine tablets in Oslo."

This paper reviews experiences and practices with potassium iodide in the thyroid protection. This kind of information should serve as the basis for discussion and decision making on KI prophylactic programmes in nuclear emergency situations in Croatia. If Croatia adopts such programme, it will still have to develop the most effective way of KI stockpiling and distribution or predistribution."

The authors applied logistic regression to develop a predictive model for a medium-sized not-for-profit community hospital in California using patient-level data with more specific patient information (including 13 explanatory variables). Specifically, the logistic regression is applied to 2 populations: a general population including all patients and the specific group of patients targeted by the CMS penalty (characterized as ages 65 or older with select conditions). The 2 resulting logistic regression models have a higher sensitivity rate compared to the sensitivity of the LACE index. The C statistic values of the model applied to both populations demonstrate moderate levels of predictive power. The authors also build an economic model to demonstrate the potential financial impact of the use of the model for targeting high-risk patients in a sample hospital and demonstrate that, on balance, whether the hospital gains or loses from reducing readmissions depends on its margin and the extent of its readmission penalties."

A LACE index score was calculated for each patient and assessed using receiver operator characteristic curves.Results: During the study period, 2,662 patients had 5,979 hospitalizations for COPD. Four percent of patients died in hospital and 25% were readmitted within 30 days; 56% of all 30-day readmissions were again due to COPD. The most common reasons for readmission, following COPD, were heart failure, pneumonia, and chest pain. The LACE index had moderate discriminative ability to predict 30-day readmission (C-statistic =0.63).Conclusion: The 30-day hospital readmission rate was 25% following hospitalization for COPD in an Australian tertiary hospital and as such comparable to international published rates. The LACE index only had moderate discriminative ability to predict 30-day readmission in patients hospitalized for COPD."

Revised LACE index scores were equivalent for readmission vs. non-readmission episodes, {median 7 [interquartile range (IQR) 5, 8] vs. 7 [IQR 4, 8])}, as were median abbreviated mental test (8 [IQR 6, 9] vs. 8 [IQR 6, 9]) and clinical frailty scale scores (5 [IQR 3, 6] vs. 5 [IQR 3, 6]).

Even so, determining which patients derive benefit from PD-1/PD-L1-directed immunotherapy remains an important clinical question, particularly in light of the autoimmune toxicity of these agents.

However, subsequent observations have questioned the prospect of using PD-L1 expression as a biomarker for selecting patients for therapy, especially since many patients considered PD-L1-negative experience a benefit from treatment. Importantly, there is not yet a definitive test for determination of PD-L1 and a cut-off reference for PD-L1-positive status has not been established. Immunohistochemistry with different antibodies and different thresholds has been used to define PD-L1 positivity (1-50 %), with no clear superiority of one threshold over another for identifying which patients respond. Moreover, the type of cells on which PD-L1 expression is most relevant is not yet clear, with immune infiltrate cells and tumor cells both being used. In conclusion, while PD-L1 expression is often a predictive factor for treatment response, it must be complemented by other biomarkers or histopathologic features, such as the composition and amount of inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment and their functional status.

					"context": "BACKGROUND: The PD-1 receptor and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 are known to be significantly involved in T-cell regulation. Recent studies suggest that PD-L1 expression in malignant tumors contributes to an immunosuppressive microenvironment and disruption of antitumoral immune response. Drugs targeting this pathway are already tested in clinical trials against several tumor entities with promising results. However, until now comprehensive data with regard to PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is still lacking.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression via immunohistochemistry in two independent cohorts of 293 HNSCC patients.RESULTS: A significant subset of HNSCC showed high expression levels of PD-L1. Most remarkable, we detected a strong correlation between PD-L1 expression and overall survival time in both HNSCC cohorts. Further, in multivariate cox proportional hazard models, PD-L1 dominates as the strongest prognostic factor of patient's outcome in HNSCC, leaving even tumor stage and distant metastasis behind. Moreover, strong PD-L1 expression was associated with the presence of distant metastases in a subset of cases.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, while the significance of PD-L2 in HNSCC seems to minor, we show that PD-L1 expression is common in HNSCC and, more importantly, a both robust and strong prognostic biomarker. In this respect, our results provide hints on further application of therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in HNSCC. Investigation of response and outcome of patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 containing therapies in correlation with PD-L1 expression analysis should be an important task for the future.STATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: In spite of improved treatment options and increasing knowledge of molecular alterations in HNSCC, the survival rate has not been dramatically changed in the past decades. Pies are missing in HNSCC. One promising candidate in cancer immune therapy is PD-L1. Drugs targeting PD-L1 or its receptor PD-1 are subject of several clinical studies in different cancer entities. However, comprehensive data about PD-L1 expression in HNSCC and therefore a rational basis for anti PD-L1/PD-1 therapy in HNSCC is lacking. Here, we provide wide-ranging data about PD-L1 expression in HNSCC of all major localizations. We observed a strong correlation between expression of PD-L1 and reduced overall survival time. Furthermore, high PD-L1 expression was identified as a strong prognostic factor of patient's outcome when verified together with recognized prognostic factors."

					"context": "Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare, heterogeneous and ubiquitous tumors commonly localized in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, and pancreas. The clinical behavior of NEN is highly unpredictable; in fact, low-grade cases can unexpectedly be associated with metastases. Currently, the 2010 WHO NEN classification employs histological differentiation and the proliferation index for grading tumors but fails to provide reliable prognostic and therapeutic indications. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a better characterization of G2/G3 NENs. Similar to several other tumors, NENs possess immune-escape mechanisms, but very little has yet been done to characterize this crucial aspect. There are no available data describing PD-L1 expression in these tumors. Here we provide, for the first time, evidence of PD-L1 tissue expression in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs). PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with a high-grade WHO classification (G3) (P<0.001) but not with gender, primary site, or lymph node status. The PD-L1 positivity rate and signal intensity are directly correlated (P<0.001) with a grade increase from G1 to G3. In particular in G3 cases, we observed a dichotomy between the morphology (WD- and PD-NENs) and Ki67. Moreover, our study demonstrated a significant association with the grade and PD-L1 expression levels in immune-infiltrating cells (P<0.001). In particular, G3 tumors are characterized by strong PD-L1 expression in both the tumor and infiltrating immune cells (P<0.001), reflecting an unfavorable environment for T-cell-mediated tumor aggression. These findings suggest that NENs might acquire resistance to immune surveillance by upregulating PD-L1 and inhibiting peritumoral and intratumoral infiltrating lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate that PD-L1 is currently the best-known biomarker for G3 NENs, becoming the new gold standard for G3 NEN discrimination. Furthermore, pharmacological approaches using anti-PD-1 antibodies may become the logical choice for the treatment of G3 cases with a poor prognosis."

Most recently, two phase III first-line NSCLC studies have provided evidence that tumour mutational burden (TMB) correlates with the clinical response to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (CheckMate-227; NCT02477826), whereas atezolizumab response was correlated with T effector gene signature expression (IMPower 150; NCT02366143). Both studies demonstrated a significant primary endpoint [progression-free survival (PFS)] benefit in the TMB group and in the group of patients expressing a T effector cell signature, respectively. However, PFS benefit in both studies was seen regardless of the PD-L1 status of all patients suggesting that TMB and T effector cell signatures may be more robust to predict clinical response following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. The role of putative novel predictive biomarkers evaluated in the CheckMate-227 and the IMPower 150 trials may, if confirmed in future prospective studies, offer a new perspective for predicting immunotherapy treatment outcomes of NSCLC patients in the near future."

					"context": "BACKGROUND: Carcinosarcomas of the gynecologic tract, also known as malignant mixed Müllerian tumors, are aggressive neoplasms with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Despite advances in adjuvant therapies in recent years, the prognosis of these tumors has not improved. In fact, there are currently no consensus guidelines for the treatment of these neoplasms and the search for targetable biomarkers has not been successful so far. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. In normal conditions, PD-L1 is thought to promote immune homeostasis via a number of pathways, but mainly through downregulation of cytotoxic T cells. In some human neoplasms, however, overexpression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been observed, which can modulate the immune system to allow cancer cells to evade host response. As this marker could potentially be a therapeutic target for these tumors, the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in a group of carcinosarcomas was evaluated in the present study.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine cases of gynecologic carcinosarcomas were analyzed, corresponding to tumors originating from the uterus (25), ovary (2), fallopian tube (1), and pelvic epithelium (1). Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 was performed on paraffin sections and the staining results were assessed semiquantitatively in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of each tumor.RESULTS: Positive membranous staining for PD-L1 was detected in 25/29 tumors (86%). The epithelial components were strongly positive in 19/29 (65%) and weakly positive in 6/29 tumors (21%). The mesenchymal elements were strongly positive in 8/29 (27%) and weakly positive in 3/29 tumors (10%). With exception of 1, all tumors with positive sarcomatous components had staining of the carcinomatous element. Four tumors were negative for PD-L1 in both components.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PD-L1 is expressed by the majority of carcinosarcomas, predominantly in the epithelial components. This is particularly important as most locoregional recurrences and distant metastases are of epithelial origin. This finding may serve as a basis for possible therapeutic approaches using antibodies that have already shown significant value in a number of other malignant tumors."

A humanized antibody, PRL3-zumab, specifically binds to an intracellular oncogenic phosphatase PRL3, which is frequently expressed in several cancers. Here we show that PRL3-zumab specifically inhibits PRL3+ cancer cells in vivo, but not in vitro. PRL3 antigens are detected on the cell surface and outer exosomal membranes, implying an 'inside-out' externalization of PRL3. PRL3-zumab binds to surface PRL3 in a manner consistent with that in classical antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis tumor elimination pathways, as PRL3-zumab requires an intact Fc region and host FcγII/III receptor engagement to recruit B cells, NK cells and macrophages to PRL3+ tumor microenvironments. PRL3 is overexpressed in 80.6% of 151 fresh-frozen tumor samples across 11 common cancers examined, but not in patient-matched normal tissues, thereby implicating PRL3 as a tumor-associated antigen. Targeting externalized PRL3 antigens with PRL3-zumab may represent a feasible approach for anti-tumor immunotherapy."

					"context": "In rodent studies, the gut microbiota has been implicated in facilitating both radioresistance, by protecting the epithelium from apoptotic responses and radiosensitivity, inducing endothelial apoptotic responses. Despite the observation that large animal models, such as the Chinese Rhesus macaque and the Gottingen Minipig, demonstrate similarity to human physiologic responses to radiation, little is known about radiation-induced changes of the gut microbiome in these models. To compare the two models, we used bioequivalent radiation doses which resulted in an LD50 for Gottingen Minipigs and Chinese Rhesus macaques, 1.9 Gy and 6.8 Gy, respectively. Fecal samples taken prior and 3 days post-radiation were used for 16S rRNA gene sequence amplicon high throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Baseline gut microbiota profiles were dissimilar between minipigs and rhesus macaques. Irradiation profoundly impacted gut microbiota profiles in both animals. Significant increases of intracellular symbionts were common to both models and to reported changes in rodents suggesting universality of these findings post-radiation. Remarkably, opposite dynamics were observed for the main phyla, with increase of Firmicutes and decrease of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in minipigs but with enrichment of Bacteroidetes in rhesus macaques. Minipig changes in magnitude and in variety of species affected were more extensive than those observed in rhesus macaques. This pilot study provides an important first step in comparing the radiosensitive pig model to the comparatively more radioresistant macaque model, for the identification of microbial elements which may influence radiosensitivity."

					"context": "The sterile insect technique (SIT) as an eco-friendly and reliable strategy has been used to control populations of insect pests of agricultural, veterinary and human health importance. Successful applications of SIT rely on the high-level ecological fitness of sterile males. A suitable and stable gut microbiome can contribute to the ecological fitness of insect by influencing their physiology, biochemistry and development processes. Here, we show that a shift in the gut bacterial composition and structure by sterilizing irradiation, characterized by a decrease in the major gut microbiota community Enterobacteriaceae, an expansion of the minor members (e.g., Bacillaceae) and a higher richness and diversity, is tightly linked to radiation-induced ecological fitness (male mating competitiveness, flight capacity, survival rate and life span) decline in Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) sterile males. Function prediction of gut microbiota indicated that changes in microbiome taxonomy tend to drive microbiome functional shifts. A higher nutrient consumption of the flourishing minor gut microbiota may cause a decline in nutrients and energy metabolic activity of host and then result in the reduced ecological fitness of irradiated flies. Furthermore, we found that a gut bacterial strain Klebsiella oxytoca (BD177) can restore ecological fitness by improving food intake and increasing haemolymph sugar and amino acid levels of irradiated B. dorsalis flies. Our findings suggest that gut symbiont-based probiotics can be used as agents for reversing radiation-induced ecological fitness decrease."

					"context": "Background: Non-motor symptoms (NMSs) are a real burden in Parkinson's disease (PD). They may appear in early pre-symptomatic stage as well as throughout the disease course. However, their relationship with the deterioration of the patient's quality of life (QoL) is still under debate. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of NMSs and their impact on the QoL in a cohort of Moroccan patients.Methods: We carried out a cross-transactional study, where a total of 117 patients were submitted to a structured clinical interview and examination investigating motor and NMSs based on common and conventional scales. Motor symptoms were assessed by the UPDRS I-VI during ON condition. The NMSs were evaluated with common scales and their relationship with the QoL was investigated.Results: The mean patient's age was 60.77 ± 11.36 years old, and the median disease duration was 6 years [2.5-9.5]. Motor's phenotype subtypes were the mixed form in 40.2% of patients, akinetic-rigid in 20.5% and a tremor-dominant form in 39.3%. The median Hoehn and Yahr staging was 2 [1-2.5]. Regarding NMSs, the most common were urinary dysfunctions (82.6%), sleep (80.6%), and gastrointestinal (80%) disorders. Other autonomic dysfunctions were also frequent: thermoregulatory dysfunctions 58.6%, cardiovascular troubles 50.9%, and sexual dysfunctions 47.9%. Depression was present in 47.9% and fatigue symptoms in 23.1%. The median score of SCOPA-AUT was 14 [7.75-21.80]. The median PD questionnaire 39-score index (PDQ39-SI) was 23.22% and the most affected dimension was \"mobility.\" Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the SCOPA-AUT score impacted the QoL (p = 0.001), especially the gastrointestinal (p = 0.007), and cardiovascular (p = 0.049) dimensions.Conclusion: Our data show that all patients have presented at least one NMS. Autonomic and sleep disorders were the most frequent, and in contrast to other studies, digestive and cardiovascular disorders were rather the factors influencing negatively the QoL of patients. Understanding the pathophysiology of these NMSs should be placed at the forefront in order to develop new therapeutic approaches by improving the QoL of PD patients."

Patients were assessed preoperatively and followed up for 6 to 12 months using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in four conditions (stimulation OFF and ON and medication OFF and ON), the levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD), dyskinesia and fluctuation scores and PDQ39 scale for quality of life (QOL). Postoperative side effects were also recorded. Results: The mean age at disease onset was 42.31 ± 7.29 years [28-58] and the mean age at surgery was 54.66 ± 8.51 years [34-70]. The median disease duration was 11.95 ± 4.28 years [5-22]. Sixty-three percentage of patients were male. 11.4% of patients were tremor dominant while 45.71 showed akinetic-rigid form and 42.90 were classified as mixed phenotype. The LEDD before surgery was 1200 mg/day [800-1500]. All patients had motor fluctuations whereas non-motor fluctuations were present in 61.80% of cases. STN DBS decreased the LEDD by 51.72%, as the mean LEDD post-surgery was 450 [188-800]. The UPDRS-III was improved by 52.27%, dyskinesia score by 66.70% and motor fluctuations by 50%, whereas QOL improved by 27.12%. Post-operative side effects were hypophonia (2 cases), infection (3 cases), and pneumocephalus (2 cases). Conclusion: Our results showed that STN DBS is an effective treatment in Moroccan Parkinsonian patients leading to a major improvement of the most disabling symptoms (dyskinesia, motor fluctuation) and a better QOL."

Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) (Borg >6-20 Scale) were recorded at the end of each PRE training session.RESULTS: The EG displayed significant ameliorations in Length (CoP parameters) from pre- to post-test (P=0.048), in speed of fast rhythm walking (TMWT) from pre- to post-test (P=0.000), and from pre- to re-test (P=0.027), and in the PDQ39 Score from pre- to post-test (P=0.024). No significant differences were detected in Area or Speed (CoP parameters), speed of preferred rhythm walking (TMWT), FOG-Q scores, or the motor portion of the MDS-UPDRS scores. The EG reported a mean RPE of 9.95 (between \"very light\" and \"fairly light\") for the whole training program.CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support for the use of PRE training in the rehabilitation of individuals with AR-subtype PD, as it can improve static posturography, gait, and quality of life. Furthermore, RPE scores showed that individuals with AR-subtype PD consider that PRE training require only light efforts.CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: The PRE training can be a helpful and fruitful rehabilitation tool for AR-subtype PD patients."

Additionally, evidence for PT and OT in NMS would give added weight to get these interventions covered through medical insurance."

					"context": "The sixth \"Melanoma Bridge Meeting\" took place in Naples, Italy, December 1st-4th, 2015. The four sessions at this meeting were focused on: (1) molecular and immune advances; (2) combination therapies; (3) news in immunotherapy; and 4) tumor microenvironment and biomarkers. Recent advances in tumor biology and immunology has led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic agents that prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of cancer patients. Immunotherapies in particular have emerged as highly successful approaches to treat patients with cancer including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and Hodgkin's disease. Specifically, many clinical successes have been using checkpoint receptor blockade, including T cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. Despite demonstrated successes, responses to immunotherapy interventions occur only in a minority of patients. Attempts are being made to improve responses to immunotherapy by developing biomarkers. Optimizing biomarkers for immunotherapy could help properly select patients for treatment and help to monitor response, progression and resistance that are critical challenges for the immuno-oncology (IO) field. Importantly, biomarkers could help to design rational combination therapies. In addition, biomarkers may help to define mechanism of action of different agents, dose selection and to sequence drug combinations. However, biomarkers and assays development to guide cancer immunotherapy is highly challenging for several reasons: (i) multiplicity of immunotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action including immunotherapies that target activating and inhibitory T cell receptors (e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.); adoptive T cell therapies that include tissue infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and T cell receptor (TCR) modified T cells; (ii) tumor heterogeneity including changes in antigenic profiles over time and location in individual patient; and (iii) a variety of immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) including T regulatory cells (Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and immunosuppressive cytokines. In addition, complex interaction of tumor-immune system further increases the level of difficulties in the process of biomarkers development and their validation for clinical use. Recent clinical trial results have highlighted the potential for combination therapies that include immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Agents targeting other immune inhibitory (e.g., Tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., CD137) receptors on T cells and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer are tested for clinical efficacy in melanoma as well. These agents are also being tested in combination with targeted therapies to improve upon shorter-term responses thus far seen with targeted therapy. Various locoregional interventions that demonstrate promising results in treatment of advanced melanoma are also integrated with immunotherapy agents and the combinations with cytotoxic chemotherapy and inhibitors of angiogenesis are changing the evolving landscape of therapeutic options and are being evaluated to prevent or delay resistance and to further improve survival rates for melanoma patients' population. This meeting's specific focus was on advances in immunotherapy and combination therapy for melanoma. The importance of understanding of melanoma genomic background for development of novel therapies and biomarkers for clinical application to predict the treatment response was an integral part of the meeting. The overall emphasis on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward integrating biomarkers into personalized-medicine approach for treatment of patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. Translation of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across different tumors represents a bridge to impact on prognosis and response to therapy in melanoma. We also discussed the requirements for pre-analytical and analytical as well as clinical validation process as applied to biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. The concept of the fit-for-purpose marker validation has been introduced to address the challenges and strategies for analytical and clinical validation design for specific assays."

					"context": "PURPOSE: Promising results in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been seen with agents targeting immune checkpoints, such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). However, only a select group of patients respond to these interventions. The identification of biomarkers that predict clinical benefit to immune checkpoint blockade is critical to successful clinical translation of these agents.METHODS: We conducted an integrated analysis of three independent large datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas of lung adenocarcinoma and two datasets from MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), Profiling of Resistance Patterns and Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Evaluation of Cancers of the Thorax (named PROSPECT) and Biomarker-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination (named BATTLE-1). Comprehensive analysis of mRNA gene expression, reverse-phase protein array, IHC, and correlation with clinical data were performed.RESULTS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is highly associated with an inflammatory tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma, independent of tumor mutational burden. We found immune activation coexistent with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, TIM-3, B7-H3, BTLA, and CTLA-4, along with increases in tumor infiltration by CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in lung adenocarcinomas that displayed an EMT phenotype. Furthermore, we identify B7-H3 as a prognostic marker for NSCLC.CONCLUSIONS: The strong association between EMT status and an inflammatory tumor microenvironment with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules warrants further investigation of using EMT as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade agents and other immunotherapies in NSCLC and possibly a broad range of other cancers.

Immune checkpoint blockade improves survival in a subset of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but robust biomarkers that predict response to PD-1 pathway inhibitors are lacking. Furthermore, our understanding of the diversity of the NSCLC tumor immune microenvironment remains limited. METHODS. We performed comprehensive flow cytometric immunoprofiling on both tumor and immune cells from 51 NSCLCs and integrated this analysis with clinical and histopathologic characteristics, next-generation sequencing, mRNA expression, and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS. Cytometric profiling identified an immunologically \"hot\" cluster with abundant CD8+ T cells expressing high levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 and an immunologically \"cold\" cluster with lower relative abundance of CD8+ T cells and expression of inhibitory markers. The \"hot\" cluster was highly enriched for expression of genes associated with T cell trafficking and cytotoxic function and high PD-L1 expression by IHC. There was no correlation between immunophenotype and KRAS or EGFR mutation, or patient smoking history, but we did observe an enrichment of squamous subtype and tumors with higher mutation burden in the \"hot\" cluster. Additionally, approximately 20% of cases had high B cell infiltrates with a subset producing IL-10. CONCLUSIONS. Our results support the use of immune-based metrics to study response and resistance to immunotherapy in lung cancer. FUNDING. The Robert A. and Renée E.

					"context": "Co-stimulatory and inhibitory receptors expressed by immune cells in the tumor microenvironment modulate the immune response and cancer progression. Their expression and regulation are still not fully characterized and a better understanding of these mechanisms is needed to improve current immunotherapies. Our previous work has identified a novel ligand/receptor pair, LLT1/CD161, that modulates immune responses. Here, we extensively characterize its expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We show that LLT1 expression is restricted to germinal center (GC) B cells within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), representing a new hallmark of the presence of active TLS in the tumor microenvironment. CD161-expressing immune cells are found at the vicinity of these structures, with a global enrichment of NSCLC tumors in CD161+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as compared to normal distant lung and peripheral blood. CD161+ CD4+ T cells are more activated and produce Th1-cytokines at a higher frequency than their matched CD161-negative counterparts. Interestingly, CD161+ CD4+ T cells highly express OX40 co-stimulatory receptor, less frequently 4-1BB, and display an activated but not completely exhausted PD-1-positive Tim-3-negative phenotype. Finally, a meta-analysis revealed a positive association of CLEC2D (coding for LLT1) and KLRB1 (coding for CD161) gene expression with favorable outcome in NSCLC, independently of the size of T and B cell infiltrates. These data are consistent with a positive impact of LLT1/CD161 on NSCLC patient survival, and make CD161-expressing CD4+ T cells ideal candidates for efficient anti-tumor recall responses."

As resistance to immunotherapy has been associated with EMT and immune exclusion in melanoma, it is important to understand alterations to T-cell infiltration and the tumor microenvironment during EMT in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. We conducted an integrated analysis of the immune landscape in NSCLCs through EMT scores derived from a previously established 16 gene signature of canonical EMT markers. EMT was associated with exclusion of immune cells critical in the immune response to cancer, with significantly lower infiltration of CD4 T-cells in lung adenocarcinoma and CD4/CD8 T-cells in squamous cell carcinoma. EMT was also associated with increased expression of multiple immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and TGF-β. Furthermore, overexpression of targetable immune checkpoints, such as CTLA-4 and TIM-3 were associated with EMT in both NSCLCs. An association may exist between immune exclusion and EMT in NSCLC. Further investigation is merited as its mechanism is not completely understood and a better understanding of this association could lead to the development of biomarkers that could accurately predict response to immunotherapy."

					"context": "The use of hadron beams, especially proton beams, in cancer radiotherapy has expanded rapidly in the past two decades. To fully realize the advantages of hadron therapy over traditional x-ray and gamma-ray therapy requires accurate positioning of the Bragg peak throughout the tumor being treated. A half century ago, suggestions had already been made to use protons themselves to develop images of tumors and surrounding tissue, to be used for treatment planning. The recent global expansion of hadron therapy, coupled with modern advances in computation and particle detection, has led several collaborations around the world to develop prototype detector systems and associated reconstruction codes for proton computed tomography (pCT), as well as more simple proton radiography, with the ultimate intent to use such systems in clinical treatment planning and verification. Recent imaging results of phantoms in hospital proton beams are encouraging, but many technical and programmatic challenges remain to be overcome before pCT scanners will be introduced into clinics. This review introduces hadron therapy and the perceived advantages of pCT and proton radiography for treatment planning, reviews its historical development, and discusses the physics related to proton imaging, the associated experimental and computation issues, the technologies used to attack the problem, contemporary efforts in detector and computational development, and the current status and outlook."

					"context": "INTRODUCTION: Grade IV vestibular schwannoma (Koos classification) is generally considered to be an indication for microsurgical resection or combined radiosurgery-microsurgery. However, the place of Gamma Knife stereotactic surgery (GK-SRS), either as first-line treatment or when progression of residual tumor compresses the brainstem, has not been clearly evaluated. This article reports the results of a large case series of patients with grade 4 vestibular schwannoma treated by GK-SRS.MATERIAL AND METHOD: All consecutive patients with grade IV vestibular schwannoma treated by GK-SRS in our department between 1996 and 2011 with a minimum follow-up of 3 years were included in this study.RESULTS: 86 patients were treated by GK-SRS with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Mean follow-up was 6.2 years (3-16 years). The mean age of the patients at the time of GK-SRS was 54.6 years (range: 23-84) and the sex ratio was 0.6. At the time of radiosurgery, no patient presented brainstem dysfunction prior to GK-SRS. 38 patients had functional hearing before treatment. One patient presented mild trigeminal neuralgia before GK-SRS. Tumor control with no clinical deterioration was obtained in 78 patients (90.7%). No radiation-induced brainstem or cranial nerve toxicity was observed in any of these patients. Functional hearing was maintained in 25 patients. 8 (9.3%) patients presented tumor growth and required microsurgical resection in 7 cases and ventricular shunt in 1 case.CONCLUSION: On the basis of this large series, GK-SRS appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for grade IV vestibular schwannoma for patients with no signs of brainstem dysfunction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Microsurgery, radiotherapy and observation groups comprised 43, 46 and 53 patients, respectively. All patients completed four QOL (questionnaires: Short-Form Health Survey 36, Hearing Handicap Inventory, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Dizziness Handicap Inventory Short-Form). Clinical symptoms and QOL were compared among groups.RESULTS: The average time interval between management and filling in the questionnaires was 66 months. There was no difference in QOL between the three groups on any of the four questionnaires. The most debilitating symptom was vertigo for all three groups. Tinnitus was a pejorative factor in the surgery group. Hearing level was deteriorated after microsurgery but there was no significant difference between the radiotherapy group and the middle fossa approach.CONCLUSION: Patients with small VS stage 1 and 2 had similar QOL, irrespective of management by observation, radiotherapy or microsurgery. The overall predictor for long-term reduced QOL was vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation could improve QOL in symptomatic patients.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

While this classification system is widely reported in the literature, to date no study has assessed its reliability.OBJECTIVE: To assess the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the Koos classification system.METHODS: After institutional review board approval was obtained, a cross-sectional group of the Magnetic Resonance imagings of 40 patients with vestibular schwannomas varying in size comprised the study sample. Four raters were selected to assign a Koos grade to 50 total scans. Inter- and intrarater reliability were calculated and reported using Fleiss' kappa, Kendall's W, and Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability was found to be substantial when measured using Fleiss' kappa (.71), extremely strong using Kendall's W (.92), and excellent as calculated by ICC (.88).Intrarater reliability was perfect for 3 out of 4 raters as assessed using weighted kappa, Kendall's W and ICC, with the intrarater agreement for the fourth rater measured as extremely high.CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the Koos classification system for vestibular schwannoma is a reliable method for tumor classification. This study lends further support to the results of current literature using Koos grading system.

					"context": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs) are predictive of hearing preservation in patients undergoing vestibular schwannoma removal through middle fossa craniotomy approach.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case study.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Eighteen patients who underwent a middle fossa craniotomy for vestibular schwannoma (stage I or II of Koos classification) with attempted hearing preservation from January 2008 to February 2016 were retrospectively reviewed.INTERVENTION: Pre-surgical cVEMPs test, videonystagmography (caloric test), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as a pre- and post-surgical audiometry test.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: cVEMPs parameters including amplitude asymmetry ratio (AR), P13, and N23 latencies and peak-to-peak amplitude between P13 and N23 waves were calculated. Hearing data were classified according to the AAO-HNS hearing classes. The nerve of origin of the tumor was specified during surgery and the largest tumor diameter was measure on MRI axial plane on T2-CISS weighed images.RESULTS: Preoperative amplitude asymmetry ratio was lower (n = 15, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001) in the group with postoperative hearing preservation (n = 11) compared with the group with postoperative hearing preservation failure (n = 4). The positive predictive value of an AR less than 24% to assess postoperative hearing preservation is 91.6%. Tumor size and localization were not correlated with cVEMPs, nor with caloric testing in this group of small-sized intracanalicular vestibular schwannomas.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that cVEMPs may help predict hearing preservation outcome in vestibular schwannoma surgery via the middle fossa craniotomy approach."

These plasma-isolated exosomes can be used as a non-invasive and repeatable way for the detection and follow-up of these biomarkers. One ml of plasma from 12 NSCLC patients, with different mutations and treatments (and 6 healthy donors as controls), were used as exosome sources. After RNAse treatment, in order to degrade circulating miRNAs, the exosomes were isolated with a commercial kit and resuspended in specific buffers for further analysis. The exosomes were characterized by western blotting for ALIX and TSG101 and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, the standard techniques to obtain biochemical and dimensional data of these nanovesicles. Total RNA extraction was performed with a high yield commercial kit. Due to the limited miRNA-content in exosomes, we decided to perform retro-transcription PCR using an individual assay for each selected miRNA. A panel of miRNAs (30b, 30c, 103, 122, 195, 203, 221, 222), all correlated with NSCLC disease, were analyzed taking advantage of the remarkable sensitivity and specificity of Real-Time PCR analysis; mir-1228-3p was used as endogenous control and data were processed according to the formula 2(-) (ΔΔct) (13).

To address this item, we exploited here a single-tube liquid biopsy, to detect both epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive CTCs and EpCAM-low/negative CTCs, because down-modulation of EpCAM is considered the first step in EMT. Furthermore, we analyzed the DNA from CTCs of four different phenotypes (ctcDNA), according to their EpCAM expression and cytokeratin pattern, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), in order to disclose activating and resistance-driving mutations.

By custom array-CGH, we further investigated this family and report here that patients carry a large (∼660 kb) heterozygous deletion that begins 66 kb upstream of the LMNB1 promoter. Lamin B1 overexpression was confirmed in further ADLD-1-TO tissues and in a postmortem brain sample, where lamin B1 was increased in the frontal lobe. Through parallel studies, we investigated both loss of genetic material and chromosomal rearrangement as possible causes of LMNB1 overexpression, and found that ADLD-1-TO plausibly results from an enhancer adoption mechanism. The deletion eliminates a genome topological domain boundary, allowing normally forbidden interactions between at least three forebrain-directed enhancers and the LMNB1 promoter, in line with the observed mainly cerebral localization of lamin B1 overexpression and myelin degeneration. This second route to LMNB1 overexpression and ADLD is a new example of the relevance of regulatory landscape modifications in determining Mendelian phenotypes."

We have identified the minimal duplicated region necessary for the disease, defined all the duplication junctions at the nucleotide level and identified the first inverted LMNB1 duplication. We have demonstrated that the duplications are not recurrent; patients with identical duplications share the same haplotype, likely inherited from a common founder and that the duplications originated from intrachromosomal events. The duplication junction sequences indicated that nonhomologous end joining or replication-based mechanisms such fork stalling and template switching or microhomology-mediated break induced repair are likely to be involved. LMNB1 expression was increased in patients' fibroblasts both at mRNA and protein levels and the three LMNB1 alleles in ADLD patients show equal expression, suggesting that regulatory regions are maintained within the rearranged segment. These results have allowed us to elucidate duplication mechanisms and provide insights into allele-specific LMNB1 expression levels."

Lamin B1 levels were dramatically increased in ADLD nuclei, both in skin fibroblasts and skeletal muscle fibres. Since lamin B1 is known to bind Oct-1, a transcription factor involved in the oxidative stress pathway, we investigated Oct-1 fate in ADLD. Oct-1 recruitment to the nuclear periphery was increased in ADLD cells, while nucleoplasmic localisation of the transcription factor under oxidative stress conditions was reduced. Importantly, lamin B1 degradation occurring in some, but not all ADLD cell lines, slowed down lamin B1 and Oct-1 accumulation. In skeletal muscle, focal disorganisation of sarcomeres was observed, while IIB-myosin heavy chain, an Oct-1 target gene, was under-expressed and rod-containing fibres were formed. These data show that a high degree of regulation of lamin B1 expression is implicated in the different clinical phenotypes observed in ADLD and show that altered Oct-1 nuclear localisation contributes to the disease phenotype."

To address this question, we developed a mouse model of ADLD that overexpresses lamin B1. These mice exhibited cognitive impairment and epilepsy, followed by age-dependent motor deficits. Selective overexpression of lamin B1 in oligodendrocytes also resulted in marked motor deficits and myelin defects, suggesting these deficits are cell autonomous. Proteomic and genome-wide transcriptome studies indicated that lamin B1 overexpression is associated with downregulation of proteolipid protein, a highly abundant myelin sheath component that was previously linked to another myelin-related disorder, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Furthermore, we found that lamin B1 overexpression leads to reduced occupancy of Yin Yang 1 transcription factor at the promoter region of proteolipid protein. These studies identify a mechanism by which lamin B1 overexpression mediates oligodendrocyte cell-autonomous neuropathology in ADLD and implicate lamin B1 as an important regulator of myelin formation and maintenance during aging."

Advances in high-throughput approaches will underpin increased understanding of radiosensitivity and the development of future predictive assays for clinical application. There is an established contribution of genetics as a risk factor for radiotherapy side effects. An individual's radiosensitivity is an inherited polygenic trait with an architecture that includes rare mutations in a few genes that confer large effects and common variants in many genes with small effects. Current thinking is that some will be tissue specific, and future tests will be tailored to the normal tissues at risk. The relationship between normal and tumor cell radiosensitivity is poorly understood. Data are emerging suggesting interplay between germline genetic variation and epigenetic modification with growing evidence that changes in DNA methylation regulate the radiosensitivity of cancer cells and histone acetyltransferase inhibitors have radiosensitizing effects. Changes in histone methylation can also impair DNA damage response signaling and alter radiosensitivity. An important effort to advance radiobiology in the genomic era was establishment of the Radiogenomics Consortium to enable the creation of the large radiotherapy cohorts required to exploit advances in genomics. To address challenges in harmonizing data from multiple cohorts, the consortium established the REQUITE project to collect standardized data and genotyping for ~5,000 patients. The collection of detailed dosimetric data is important to produce validated multivariable models. Continued efforts will identify new genes that impact on radiosensitivity to generate new knowledge on toxicity pathogenesis and tests to incorporate into the clinical decision-making process."

					"context": "The overall goal of radiogenomics is the identification of genomic markers that are predictive for the development of adverse effects resulting from cancer treatment with radiation. The principal rationale for a focus on toxicity in radiogenomics is that for many patients treated with radiation, especially individuals diagnosed with early-stage cancers, the survival rates are high, and therefore a substantial number of people will live for a significant period of time beyond treatment. However, many of these patients could suffer from debilitating complications resulting from radiotherapy. Work in radiogenomics has greatly benefited from creation of the Radiogenomics Consortium (RGC) that includes investigators at multiple institutions located in a variety of countries. The common goal of the RGC membership is to share biospecimens and data so as to achieve large-scale studies with increased statistical power to enable identification of relevant genomic markers. A major aim of research in radiogenomics is the development of a predictive instrument to enable identification of people who are at greatest risk for adverse effects resulting from cancer treatment using radiation. It is anticipated that creation of a predictive assay characterized by a high level of sensitivity and specificity will improve precision radiotherapy and assist patients and their physicians to select the optimal treatment for each individual."

Late radiotherapy toxicity affects quality-of-life in long-term cancer survivors and risk of side-effects in a minority limits doses prescribed to the majority of patients. Development of a test predicting risk of toxicity could benefit many cancer patients. We aimed to meta-analyze individual level data from four genome-wide association studies from prostate cancer radiotherapy cohorts including 1564 men to identify genetic markers of toxicity. Prospectively assessed two-year toxicity endpoints (urinary frequency, decreased urine stream, rectal bleeding, overall toxicity) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were tested using multivariable regression, adjusting for clinical and patient-related risk factors. A fixed-effects meta-analysis identified two SNPs: rs17599026 on 5q31.2 with urinary frequency (odds ratio [OR] 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08-4.69, p-value 4.16×10(-8)) and rs7720298 on 5p15.2 with decreased urine stream (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.90-3.86, p-value=3.21×10(-8)). These SNPs lie within genes that are expressed in tissues adversely affected by pelvic radiotherapy including bladder, kidney, rectum and small intestine. The results show that heterogeneous radiotherapy cohorts can be combined to identify new moderate-penetrance genetic variants associated with radiotherapy toxicity. The work provides a basis for larger collaborative efforts to identify enough variants for a future test involving polygenic risk profiling."

Recent reports have shown that mechanical stretching further promotes osteogenesis in BMSC/VEC co-culture systems, but the underlying mechanism of this process remains unclear. In this study, noncontact co-cultures of rat primary BMSCs and VECs were employed to interrogate paracrine cell-to-cell communications in response to tension. Exposure of VECs to 6% tension for 48 h elicited neither ALP activity nor mRNA expression of OCN and OPN in BMSCs incubated in a shared culture medium. Instead, BMSCs subjected to tension induced robust VEGF release, and its conditioned medium enhanced the proliferation and tubular formation of VECs with a concurrent increase in BMP-2 and IGF-1 production. Conditioned medium from activated VECs in turn promoted expression of osteogenic genes in BMSCs, followed by an increase in matrix mineralization. The addition of VEGF-R inhibitor Tivozanib to these systems abrogated the tension-induced paracrine effects on VECs and subsequently impaired BMSC osteogenesis. These results clearly demonstrate that the response of BMSCs to tension potentiates paracrine osteogenic signaling from VECs; this positive feedback loop is initiated by VEGF release."

This open-label, crossover clinical study (AV-951-09-902) provided access to tivozanib for patients who progressed on sorafenib in TIVO-1, comparing tivozanib with sorafenib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).METHODS: Patients enrolled in this single-arm, phase 2 crossover study were previously randomised to sorafenib on TIVO-1, progressed and then crossed over to tivozanib. Patients received tivozanib (1.5 mg/day orally; 3 weeks on/1 week off) within 4 weeks after their last sorafenib dose.FINDINGS: Crossover patients were exposed to tivozanib for a median of eight cycles. From the start of tivozanib treatment, median progression-free survival was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.3-12.7) and median overall survival was 21.6 months (95% CI: 17.0-27.6). Best overall response was partial response in 29 (18%) patients and stable disease in 83 (52%) patients, with a median duration of response of 15.2 and 12.7 months, respectively. About 77% of patients experienced adverse events, most frequently hypertension (26%), followed by diarrhoea (14%) and fatigue (13%); 53% of patients had treatment-related adverse events, including 24% grade ≥3. About 9% and 16% of patients had dose reductions and dose interruptions due to adverse events, respectively. A total of 30% of patients had serious adverse events, and 4% had treatment-related serious adverse events.INTERPRETATION: This crossover study of patients with advanced RCC demonstrated potent tivozanib anti-tumour activity. Safety and tolerability profiles were acceptable and consistent with the established adverse event profile of tivozanib.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved."

Tivozanib is a potent small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against VEGFR1-3, with activity against PDGFRα/β and cKIT. The primary endpoint of this study was progression free survival (PFS) rate at 16 weeks. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS), response rate, safety and correlative studies.Patients and methods: A Simon two-stage phase II trial was performed using tivozanib given orally at 1.5 mg daily, 3 week on 1 week off on a 28 day cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.Results: Fifty-eight patients were enrolled and treated with tivozanib. Leiomyosarcoma was the most common STS histological type in our cohort (47%) and 27 patients (46%) had received at least 3 lines of therapy prior to study entry. Up to 24 patients (41%) had prior VEGF targeted therapies. Partial response and stable disease were observed in 2 (3.6%) and 30 (54.5%) patients. The 16 week PFS rate was 36.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 23.7-49.1] and a median PFS of 3.5 months (95% CI 1.8-3). Median OS observed was 12.2 months (95% CI 8.1-16.8). The most frequent all grade toxicities were fatigue (48.3%), hypertension (43.1%), nausea (31%) and diarrhea (27.6%). The most common grade three toxicity was hypertension (22.4%). Correlative studies demonstrate no correlation between the expression of VEGFR 1, 2 or 3, PDGFRα/β or FGF, and activity of tivozanib.Conclusion: Tivozanib was well tolerated and showed antitumor activity with a promising median PFS and PFS rate at 4 months in a heavily pretreated population of metastatic STSs.

Tivozanib is an oral pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that hits a central pathway in glioblastoma angiogenesis. We conducted a phase II study to test the effectiveness of tivozanib in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Ten adult patients were enrolled and treated with tivozanib 1.5 mg daily, 3 weeks on/1 week off in 28-day cycles. Brain MRI and blood biomarkers of angiogenesis were performed at baseline, within 24-72 h of treatment initiation, and monthly thereafter. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI, dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, and vessel architecture imaging were used to assess vascular effects. Resting state MRI was used to assess brain connectivity. Best RANO criteria responses were: 1 complete response, 1 partial response, 4 stable diseases, and 4 progressive disease (PD). Two patients were taken off study for toxicity and 8 patients were taken off study for PD. Median progression-free survival was 2.3 months and median overall survival was 8.1 months. Baseline abnormal tumor vascular permeability, blood flow, tissue oxygenation and plasma sVEGFR2 significantly decreased and plasma PlGF and VEGF increased after treatment, suggesting an anti-angiogenic effect of tivozanib. However, there were no clear structural changes in vasculature as vessel caliber and enhancing tumor volume did not significantly change. Despite functional changes in tumor vasculature, tivozanib had limited anti-tumor activity, highlighting the limitations of anti-VEGF monotherapy. Future studies in glioblastoma should leverage the anti-vascular activity of agents targeting VEGF to enhance the activity of other therapies."

					"context": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most fatal gynaecological malignancy. Despite initial therapeutic response, the majority of advanced-stage patients relapse and succumb to chemoresistant disease. Overcoming drug resistance is the key to successful treatment of EOC. Members of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family are overexpressed in EOC and play key roles in its malignant progression though their contribution in development of the chemoresistant disease remains elusive. Here we show that expression of the VEGF family is higher in therapy-resistant EOC cells compared to sensitive ones. Overexpression of VEGFR2 correlated with resistance to cisplatin and combination with VEGFR2-inhibitor apatinib synergistically increased cisplatin sensitivity. Tivozanib, a pan-inhibitor of VEGF receptors, reduced proliferation of the chemoresistant EOC cells through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. Tivozanib decreased invasive potential of these cells, concomitant with reduction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and diminishing the enzymatic activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Moreover, tivozanib synergistically enhanced anti-tumour effects of EGFR-directed therapies including erlotinib. These findings suggest that the VEGF pathway has potential as a therapeutic target in therapy-resistant EOC and VEGFR blockade by tivozanib may yield stronger anti-tumour efficacy and circumvent resistance to EGFR-directed therapies."

					"context": "The selective detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is of significant clinical importance for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of cancer metastasis. However, largely because of the extremely low number of CTCs (as low as 1 in 10(9) hematologic cells) in the blood of patients, effective detection and separation of the rare cells remain a tremendous challenge. Cell rolling is known to play a key role in physiological processes such as the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation and selectin-mediated CTC metastasis. Furthermore, because CTCs typically express the epithelial-cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on the surface whereas normal hematologic cells do not, substrates with immobilized antibody against EpCAM may specifically interact with CTCs. In this article, we created biomimetic surfaces functionalized with P- and E-selectin and anti-EpCAM that induce different responses in HL-60 (used as a model of leukocytes in this study) and MCF-7 (a model of CTCs) cells. HL-60 and MCF-7 cells showed different degrees of interaction with P-/E-selectin and anti-EpCAM at a shear stress of 0.32 dyn/cm(2). HL-60 cells exhibited rolling on P-selectin-immobilized substrates at a velocity of 2.26 +/- 0.28 microm/s whereas MCF-7 cells had no interaction with the surface. Both cell lines, however, had interactions with E-selectin, and the rolling velocity of MCF-7 cells (4.24 +/- 0.31 microm/s) was faster than that of HL-60 cells (2.12 +/- 0.15 microm/s). However, only MCF-7 cells interacted with anti-EpCAM-coated surfaces, forming stationary binding under flow. More importantly, the combination of the rolling (E-selectin) and stationary binding (anti-EpCAM) resulted in substantially enhanced separation capacity and capture efficiency (more than 3-fold enhancement), as compared to a surface functionalized solely with anti-EpCAM that has been commonly used for CTC capture. Our results indicate that cell-specific detection and separation may be achieved through mimicking the biological processes of combined dynamic cell rolling and stationary binding, which will likely lead to a CTC detection device with significantly enhanced specificity and sensitivity without a complex fabrication process."

However, selective capture and quantification of CTCs from whole blood was still full of challenge due to the extremely scare number of CTCs. Moreover, how to keep a high cell viability after capture remained to be solved. Here, we described a ratiometric fluorescent probe for the efficient capture and accurate determination of CTCs by conjugating graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g-CNQDs) with gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and further linking with anti-EpCAM antibody to acquire the CTC-specific immune probe. In this probe, AuNCs protected by albumin V bovine played the role as the fluorophore reference and anti-EpCAM-attached g-CNQDs acted as both the response signal and specific recognition element for sensing CTCs. In the presence of CTCs, the quenched fluorescence of the immune probe at 500 nm was recovered due to the detachment of anti-EpCAM from the probe, whereas the intensity at 650 nm was essentially unchanged. This strategy realized the highly sensitive detection of CTCs in whole blood down to one CTC. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the designed probe allowed capturing living CTCs with minimal cell damage. The subsequent reculture of captured cells for proliferation revealed that after a 7 day proliferation, almost 28 MCF-7 cells were obtained from one target cell. The immune probe was successfully applied into capture and detection of CTCs from clinical cancer patients. Our data suggested the good potential of fluorescent probe for the clinical diagnosis of cancers."

The IMNs exhibited outstanding cell capture efficiency (above 95%) and specificity when employed to separate multiple EpCAM-positive tumor cells, due to the abundant carboxyl groups in the structure of PIL, which enhanced the coupling efficiency of MNs with anti-EpCAM by chemical bonding between carboxyls and amines, thereby enabling more target cells adhered onto IMNs. Under the optimized capture conditions, IMNs were shown an excellent cell capture performance in the range of 5-400 cells/mL in three different cases (e.g., PBS, MCF-7 and THP-1 mixed cell suspension, lysed blood). More significantly, our results indicated that with modification of PIL, in addition to the capture efficiency, the cell viability rate of CTCs was also greatly improved (98%) owing to the nontoxic and biocompatible properties of PIL, which realized the proliferation of the rare number CTCs for further molecular characterization.

In this study, a microfluidic device was proposed to generate uniform water-in-oil cell-encapsulating micro-droplets, followed by the fluorescence-based optical detection of lactic acid produced within the micro-droplets. To test its feasibility to quantify cancer cells, experiments were carried out. Results showed that the detection signals were proportional to the number of cancer cells within the micro-droplets, whereas such signals were insensitive to the existence and number of leukocytes within. To further demonstrate its feasibility for cancer cell detection, the cancer cells with known cell number in a cell suspension was detected based on the method. Results revealed that there was no significant difference between the detected number and the real number of cancer cells.

At baseline and 3months, patients were evaluated on the Movement Disorder Society Revision of the Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts III and IV.RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (95.5%) completed the study. At 3months, MDS-UPDRS part III (-5.3, p=0.0002) and part IV (-2.5, p=0.001) scores improved and off time decreased significantly (-50.1min, p=0.0004). PDQ-8 scores were unchanged at 3months.

Radiotherapy-induced side effects were scored according to the Late Effects in Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management, and Analytic (LENT-SOMA) classification system. RILA in the CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer (NK) subpopulations from peripheral blood was analyzed by flow cytometry. Multivariate predictive modeling was performed including relevant clinical risk factors.RESULTS: Low CD4+ RILA was associated with increased risk for both fibrosis (P = 0.011) and telangiectasia (P < 0.001). For fibrosis, the association was stronger outside the surgical area (Fibout; P = 0.004) than within (Fibin; P = 0.17). Predictive multivariate modeling including clinical risk factors yielded OR of 3.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.84-6.58) for any fibrosis and 8.60 (2.71-27.3) for telangiectasia. Addition of CD4+ RILA to the clinical variables improved discrimination (c statistics) from 0.62 to 0.68 for any fibrosis, 0.62 to 0.66 for Fibin, 0.61 to 0.69 for Fibout, and from 0.65 to 0.76 for telangiectasia. CD8+ and NK RILA were not significantly associated with radiotherapy-related late reactions.CONCLUSIONS: The results provide first evidence that low CD4+ RILA is associated with increased subcutaneous fibrosis and telangiectasia even after 10 years. This supports the potential usefulness for predicting individual clinical risk.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research."

We aimed toevaluate whether radiation-induced CD4 or CD8 T-lymphocyte apoptosis (RILA) correlates with the severity of radiation toxicity.Methods: Between 2007 and 2013, all patients who received more than 108% of the prescribed radiation dose, after correction of the treatment plan, were convened, and blood was sampled at 6-months follow-up. Maximal Digestive toxicity (MDT) and maximal urinary toxicity (MUT) were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v3.0 scale. RILA was assessed using flow cytometry.Results: 245 patients were included in our study. After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the MDT and MUT reached grade 3-4 in 37 patients and 56 patients, respectively. Patients with prostatectomy exhibited a statistically higher grade of MUT compared with those treated with definitive radiotherapy (p=0.03). The median RILA values were 11.8% and 15.3% for CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes, respectively. We found no significant correlation between CD4 or CD8 RILA and either MDT or MUT.Conclusion: RILA does not correlate with the inter-individual variation in MDT or MUT in the largest cohort of patients overexposed to radiation. The magnitude of the overdosage probably overrides biological predictors of toxicity, including individual radiosensitivity."

					"context": "BACKGROUND: Differentiating acute chest pain caused by myocardial ischaemia from other, potentially more benign causes of chest pain is a frequent diagnostic challenge faced by Emergency Department (ED) clinicians. Only 30% of patients presenting with chest pain will have a cardiac origin for the pain, and gastro-oesophageal disorders are one of the common sources of non-cardiac chest pain, yet remain clinically difficult to differentiate from cardiac pain.AIM: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to locate and evaluate clinical trials comparing the use of an oral gastrointestinal (GI) cocktail (oral viscous lidocaine/ antacid ± anticholinergic) to standard diagnostic protocols (serial electrocardiograms (ECGs), serial biomarkers, imaging and/ or provocative testing) to differentiate emergency patients presenting with acute chest pain caused by gastro-oesophageal disease from those with other aetiologies.METHODS: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases, scanning reference lists of articles, and searching clinical trial databases for relevantly currently registered trials. The search included PubMed (1966 - present), Embase (1980 - present) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The identified studies were evaluated with a modified QUADAS tool.RESULTS: A total of four studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Studies were of low methodological quality with heterogeneous results. There were no adequately powered and appropriately designed studies identified.DISCUSSION: Current diagnostic protocols for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) revolve around early and serial ECG monitoring and cardiac biomarker testing, imaging and careful clinical examination. In patients with chest pain and suspected ACS, the use of a GI cocktail compared with standard diagnostic protocols (serial ECG and biomarkers and provocative testing or imaging) is not proven to improve accuracy of diagnosis, and cannot reliably exclude myocardial ischaemia.Crown Copyright © 2014.

A 13-mm difference in VAS was considered clinically significant. VAS change in the three groups was compared using multivariable regression, controlling for pretreatment VAS, study drug, previous antacid use, and gastrointestinal (GI) history. One hundred twenty patients were enrolled between July and December 2000. One hundred thirteen subjects (113) completed the protocol: Group 1 (N = 38); Group 2 (N = 37); Group 3 (N = 38). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of age, gender, GI history, previous antacid use, or initial degree of pain. Group 1 had a 25 +/- 27 mm mean (+/- SD), decrease in pain; Group 2, 23 +/- 22 mm decrease; and Group 3, 24 +/- 26 mm decrease. There was no statistically significant difference in pain relief between the three groups on univariate analysis or multivariable regression.

The reason for administration of a GI cocktail was documented on only one chart. Sixty-six patients (68%) received at least one other drug, at a median time of 9 minutes before administration of the GI cocktail. The most commonly coadministered drug was a narcotic (56 patients), followed by nitroglycerin (22 patients), antiemetics (13 patients), H2-blockers (13 patients), and aspirin (10 patients). Thirty-three patients (34%) had symptomatic relief with the cocktail alone, 35 (36%) had symptomatic relief with the cocktail plus other drugs, 7 (7%) had no response to the GI cocktail alone, and 5 (5%) had no response to the cocktail with other drugs. In 17 patients (18%) the response was not documented. Chest pain patients and abdominal pain patients had a similar frequency of response. There was also similarity of response between admitted and discharged patients.CONCLUSION: Although symptomatic relief after administration of a GI cocktail is often noted, it is difficult to differentiate the effects of the cocktail from those of other coadministered medications such as morphine or nitroglycerin. We urge ED physicians to use the GI cocktail in a rational manner."

					"context": "The identification of MHC-restricted and tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) provides strong evidence in support of T cell-mediated immune surveillance against human tumour cells. These CTLs recognize short peptides derived from tumour-associated antigens in conjunction with class I molecules expressed on tumour cells. In contrast to these observations there are now numerous examples to suggest that a number of tumours escape this CTL-mediated control either by down-regulating accessory molecules or by blocking the intracellular processing of tumour-specific antigens. Recently a number of tumour cell lines have been identified which display a transcriptional deficiency of transporters associated with antigen processing (also referred to as TAP). The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumour, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), is a classic example in this category. In the present study we have restored class I-restricted antigen processing in a BL cell line by transfecting a minigene expression vector encoding a CTL epitope derived from EBV linked to an endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal sequence. These minigene transfected BL cells were not only susceptible to lysis by virus-specific CTL but were also capable of efficiently activating an antigen-specific CTL response. Interestingly, the immunogenicity of these BL cells was not affected by the significantly down-regulated expression of adhesion molecules such as LFA1 alpha, LFA1 beta and LFA3. These findings suggest that resistance of tumour cells to CTL-mediated immune control can be reversed if the relevant peptide epitopes are appropriately presented on the cell surface."

					"context": "This review summarises the evolution of recent major advances in cancer immunotherapy, using metastatic melanoma as a model. The first true clinical progress with immunotherapy developed from the application of recombinant DNA technology for the large scale production of immunostimulant cytokines. Clinical trials demonstrated that the systemic administration of recombinant high-dose bolus intravenous interleukin-2 (IL-2; 720 000 IU/kg every 8 hours) mediated objective tumour progression in 20% of patients with metastatic renal cancer and in 17% of patients with metastatic melanoma, with complete responses of 9% and 7%, respectively. The use of adoptive immunotherapy (the transfer of immune cells with anti-tumour activity to the tumour-bearing host) focused interest on T lymphocyte-mediated tumour recognition. Clinical trials described the systemic administration of lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells and subsequently tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) to patients with advanced cancer. Although able to kill tumour targets in vitro, LAK cells did not prove useful for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cancer. A randomised trial, in which IL-2 was administered alone or with LAK cells, failed to show a difference in response rate or survival. In contrast, the treatment of 86 patients with metastatic melanoma using TIL plus IL-2 resulted in a 34% objective response rate, which included patients who had previously failed treatment with high-dose IL-2 alone. The focus on cellular immune responses, combined with rapid biotechnological advances, resulted in the identification of tumour specific antigens, such as MART-1 and gp100, that could be recognised by autologous TIL. This provided fundamental evidence of the existence of melanoma-associated antigens that were recognised in vivo by effector cells of the immune system. In vitro studies demonstrated immunodominant epitopes from MART-1 and gp100 that could induce in vitro-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte reactivity. To enhance in vitro immunogenicity, single amino acid substitutions were made to identify peptides with higher affinity for HLA-A*0201. Modified peptides from gp100 were compared with the parental peptide for increased immunogenicity based on their ability to induce anti-tumour lymphocytes in vitro. From these studies, a candidate peptide was identified (G9-209-2M) which had increased immunogenic reactivity in vitro. Clinical trials demonstrated that the modified G9-209-2M peptide was more effective. Unfortunately, objective tumour regression was still low. However, when high-dose IL-2 was combined with G9-209-2M objective clinical responses increased to 42%. Efforts to find better ways to immunise against self antigens are ongoing and involve further peptide immunisations, as well as recombinant viral vectors, adjuvant cytokine therapy and cellular adjuvants such as dendritic cells."

In this review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.

					"context": "The potential for cancer immunotherapy by adoptive transfer of CD4(+) T cells is gaining increased attention. Most cancer cells lack major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and cannot present tumour-specific antigens (TSA) directly to CD4(+) T cells. We have reported that tumour-specific CD4(+) T cells collaborate with macrophages and dendritic cells. These professional antigen-presenting cells endocytose and process TSA to display antigenic peptides on their MHC class II molecules for indirect cancer cell recognition by CD4(+) T cells. We hypothesized that this critical step may depend on secretion of TSA by cancer cells. This was investigated in a mouse model for myeloma immunosurveillance mediated by CD4(+) T cells. From this study, several conclusions could be drawn. First, TSA secretion facilitates cancer immunosurveillance. Second, TSA secretion results in stronger activation of naïve tumour-specific CD4(+) T cells in lymph nodes. Third, TSA concentration within the tumour extracellular matrix must reach a certain threshold to allow successful cancer immunosurveillance. Fourth, treatment by local injection of purified TSA enhances immunity against cancer cells that do not secrete TSA. Fifth, secretion of TSA by at least some cancer cells within a tumour favours antitumour immunity. Therefore, we propose that CD4(+) T cells that recognize secreted TSA may be superior for immunotherapy by T cell transfer, because the local extracellular antigen concentration will be higher for secreted TSA. Thus, it is anticipated that secreted TSA will be more readily detected in vivo by transferred CD4(+) T cells, resulting in more efficient tumour eradication."

Gamma (γ)-sterilization has been commonly employed for wide range of products as indicated by the pharmacopoeias. However, carefully examination should be performed prior to administration since γ-radiation can cause changes in drug and polymer excipients. No information is available in literature about γ-sterilization effects on vancomycin HCl-loaded poly (ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) microspheres.OBJECTIVE: Formulations were developed using a different preparation approach for the treatment of medical device-related osteomyelitis, and γ-sterilization effects on the physicochemical characterization of the formulations were examined.METHODS: Water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsion technique using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in inner and outer phase was applied to prepare formulations. Physicochemical properties of the formulations were investigated before and after γ-sterilization and the antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) were measured.RESULTS: The particle size of the nonsterilized formulations were between 58 and 134 μm. 60% or 20% of vancomycin HCl were released from 42.500 Mn or 70.000-90.000 Mn PCL microspheres, respectively, in 24 h. No difference was observed in the particle size, drug-loading efficiency, morphology, in vitro release and antimicrobial activity of the formulations after γ-sterilization (p > 0.05)."

The aim of this study was to investigate the radioprotective effects of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) free radical scavenger on the material properties of sterilized bovine cortical bone at microstructure level. Forty-two cortical tissue specimens were excised from three bovine femurs and irradiated to 35 and 70 kGy gamma rays in the presence of 5, 50, and 100 mM concentrations of NAC. The localized variations in microhardness were evaluated via indentation in the radial and longitudinal directions to examine different regions of the microstructures of the specimens, including the osteonal and interstitial tissues. A significant increase was observed in the hardness of osteonal, interstitial, and longitudinal combined microstructures exposed to 35 and 70 kGy radiations (P < 0.05), whereas a relative reduction of the hardness was observed in the radial direction. Furthermore, it was found that the application of 50 and 100 mM NAC during gamma irradiation significantly subsided the hardening in longitudinal combined microstructure. Moreover, the reduction of hardness in radial direction was suppressed in the presence of 100 mM of NAC. In conclusion, the results indicated that NAC free radical scavenger can protect the cortical bone against deteriorative effects of ionizing radiation and can be used to improve the material properties of sterilized allografts."

					"context": "Gamma sterilization of bone allografts is used as a gold standard method to provide safety against disease transmission. However, it is well documented that high dose levels of ionizing radiation can degrade bone mechanical properties. This effect, which is attributed to the formation of free radicals through radiolysis of the water content of collagen, can lead to post-implantation difficulties such as pre-failure and/or secondary fractures of bone allografts. Recently, treatment of irradiated allografts with free radical scavengers is used to protect them against radiation-induced damages. This study aimed to investigate the radioprotective role of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) during the gamma sterilization of the cortical bone of bovine femurs using the compressive test. Totally, 195 cubic specimens with a dimension of 5 × 5 × 3 cubic mm were divided into 13 groups including a control and 12 experimental groups exposed to 18, 36, and 70 kGy at three different NAC concentrations (1.25, 12.5, and 25 mM for 18 kGy; 5, 50, and 100 mM for 36 kGy; 10, 100, and 200 mM for 70 kGy). The mechanical behavior of the sterilized specimens was studied using the uniaxial compressive test. The results indicated a concentration-dependent radioprotection effect of NAC on the plastic properties of the cortical bones. The concentration dependency of NAC was in turn related to radiation dose levels. In conclusion, treatment of bone specimens with a characteristic concentration of NAC during exposure to specific radiation dose levels can provide an efficient radioprotection window for preserving the mechanical stability of gamma sterilized allografts."

We have previously published data suggesting that cyclosporine (CyA) may reduce the development of IH in a canine model (Hirko et al., J Vasc Surg 1993;17:877-887). However, systemic administration of CyA could create serious adverse effects. Therefore, it is our long-term goal to test the hypothesis that the controlled local release of CyA from a polymeric vascular wrap would prevent the development of IH. To test this hypothesis, we developed a controlled release polymeric ring that could be placed around anastomotic sites to deliver therapeutic drugs locally. The ring is a composite polymeric device consisting of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres embedded in a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel. Several in vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of different sterilization procedures on the properties of the device. It was determined that gamma sterilization was the preferred sterilization method of choice for this device. In vivo studies were conducted on a swine model to evaluate the biocompatibility of the ring. The histological findings of the ring implants at 2 and 4 weeks demonstrate the biocompatibility of this device."

					"context": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to conduct a multicentre retrospective review of cases to clarify how many ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs) as the cause of death could be diagnosed without post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) when autopsies cannot be performed.METHODS: We collected consecutive PMCT data from January 2002 to December 2009 from three institutes where PMCT examinations are performed on a routine basis for deceased patients with unknown causes of death. A total of 19 cases were identified where PMCT revealed RAAAs. Ante-mortem clinical presentations, post-mortem external examinations, and peri-mortem ultrasonography findings were assessed for their diagnostic accuracy.RESULTS: The correct diagnosis based on the classic triad of shock, acute abdominal pain, and pulsatile abdominal mass was made in only one of 19 (5.3%) patients. Shock, acute abdominal pain, and abdominal swelling were found in five of 19 (26%) patients. Shock and acute abdominal pain or abdominal swelling were found in two of 19 (10%) patients. Ten of 19 (53%) patients only had shock. Peri-mortem ultrasonography was performed in seven of 19 patients; one was diagnosed with RAAA (14%). No patients had pre-mortem CT examinations.CONCLUSIONS: Post-mortem diagnosis of RAAA is difficult to make based on ante-mortem clinical presentation, post-mortem external examinations, or peri-mortem ultrasonography. PMCT is recommended for diagnosing RAAA as the cause of death if pre-mortem CT examinations are not carried out when autopsies cannot be performed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We have mapped the association of the estrogen receptor (ER) with the complete nonrepetitive sequence of human chromosomes 21 and 22 by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with tiled microarrays. ER binds selectively to a limited number of sites, the majority of which are distant from the transcription start sites of regulated genes. The unbiased sequence interrogation of the genuine chromatin binding sites suggests that direct ER binding requires the presence of Forkhead factor binding in close proximity.

We investigated FOXA1 for its role in predicting chemosensitivity of this subgroup in neoadjuvant chemotherapy settings.METHODS: We reviewed pathologic slides of 123 patients who were diagnosed with ER-positive breast cancer on core needle biopsy and underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our institution between 2002 and 2012. FOXA1 expression and pathologic response were evaluated. We then statistically analyzed FOXA1 expression and its relationship with chemosensitivity.RESULTS: FOXA1 expression before NAC was correlated with poor chemoresponse in ER-positive as well as luminal A and luminal B breast cancer patients (p = 0.002, 0.001, and 0.049 respectively). Significant association between change of FOXA1 staining position after NAC and chemosensitivity also was observed (p = 0.024). Multivariate analysis identified FOXA1 expression before NAC as an independent predictor of chemosensitivity in ER-positive and luminal A breast cancer patients [p = 0.002; relative risk (RR) 0.163; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.053-0.500, and p = 0.002; RR 0.055; 95 % CI 0.008-0.353, respectively]. Additionally, change of FOXA1 staining position after NAC was shown to be an independent predictor of chemoresponse in luminal B subtype breast cancer patients (p = 0.012; RR 0.153; 95 % CI 0.035-0.665).CONCLUSIONS: FOXA1 expression can independently predict chemosensitivity of ER-positive breast cancer patients."

Predictors of response to chemotherapy and prognostic factors for survival might be different in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer.METHODS: Women with Stage II to III ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer treated with anthracycline and taxane-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy between 2003 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Expression of forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) as well as ER, progesterone receptor, HER2 and Ki67 was examined by immunohistochemistry in pre- and post-treatment specimens. Factors predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and distant disease-free survival were analyzed.RESULTS: Tumor grade was positively correlated with Ki67 expression. Expression levels of ER were positively correlated with expression levels of HER2, BCL2, FOXA1 and MAPT in pre-treatment tumors. The Ki67 labeling index was the only factor that was significantly associated with clinical response measured by the reduction of tumor volume and pCR. Lymph node status, expression of ER before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and expression of FOXA1 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were significantly associated with distant disease-free survival, both by univariate and multivariate analyses.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer should be selected for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. FOXA1 expression could be a prognostic marker in ER-positive breast cancer."

					"context": "OBJECTIVE: Nuclear medicine technologists rely on a single dosimeter to measure their work-related dose. Estimates of whole-body effective dose are based on the assumptions that the radiation is incident from the front and in a uniform beam. We sought to investigate these assumptions and also to quantify doses associated with different activities.METHODS: A single technologist wore 3 electronic dosimeters for 3 mo, at the front waist, the back waist, and the front collar. The technologist also recorded her activities throughout the day.RESULTS: We found that the assumption of an anterior beam held about two thirds of the time, breaking down only when the technologist was receiving lower doses. Overall, the average whole-body dose was estimated correctly by assuming an anterior beam. We also found that irradiation was uniform (i.e., waist and collar badges gave equivalent readings) except when the technologist was performing injections. Then, the collar readings were 1.7 times the waist readings. Finally, average doses were measured for different types of activities. Performing injections registered a dose rate of approximately 2 microSv/h. Doses received while scanning ranged from 0.2 to 2 microSv/h. The average dose for a scan depended not only on the administered activity and isotope but also on the amount of patient contact required. Even for high activities, such as patients who had already received therapy, the dose to the technologist was low for patients requiring little assistance.CONCLUSION: The assumption of anterior irradiation correctly estimates whole-body effective dose. The assumption of a uniform beam is good except when injections are being performed, when the upper torso receives a much higher dose than the waist. Overall, doses to the technologist were found to be 5.4 microSv/d for scanning and 12 microSv/d for injections. These correspond to 1.4 mSv/y and 3.2 mSv/y, respectively, which are comparable to naturally occurring radiation levels and are much lower than regulatory limits. However, if the dose to a particular technologist needs to be minimized (e.g., for a pregnant worker), the most effective strategy is for the technologist to be assigned patients requiring little contact or assistance and, in particular, to avoid administering injections."

Approaches have been created to adjust the monitoring results so that mean organ absorbed doses can be estimated.RESULTS: Changes in medical technology and practices have altered the radiation exposure environments to which a worker may have been exposed during their career. Other temporal factors include shifts in regulatory requirements that influenced the conduct of radiation monitoring and the changes in the measured dose quantities.CONCLUSIONS: The use of leaded aprons during exposure to lower energy x rays encountered in fluoroscopically based radiology adds complexity to account for the shielding of the organs located in the torso when dosimeters were worn over leaded aprons. Estimating doses to unshielded tissues such as the brain and lens of the eye become less challenging when dosimeters are worn at the collar above the apron. The absence of leaded aprons in the higher energy photon settings lead to a more straightforward process of relating dosimeter results to mean organ doses."

More than 2,200 institutions chosen from different industries were surveyed for more than 2 years after the implementation of this tool.

It is characterized by a classical clinical triad: alacrima, achalasia and adrenal insufficiency, the canonic symptoms that are associated with progressive peripheral neuropathy. Only a few cohorts have been reported. The objective of the present study was to characterize the various spectra of adrenal function in Triple-A patients.METHODS: A retrospective clinical and biological monitoring of 14 patients (10 families) was done in a single multidisciplinary French center. All had AAAS gene sequenced and adrenal function evaluation.RESULTS: Nine different AAAS mutations were found, including one new mutation: c.755G>C, p.(Trp252Ser). Regarding adrenal function, defects of the zona fasciculata and reticularis were demonstrated by increased basal ACTH levels and low DHEAS levels in all cases regardless of the degree of glucocorticoid deficiency. In contrast, mineralocorticoid function was always conserved: i.e., normal plasma renin level associated with normal aldosterone level. The main prognostic feature was exacerbation of neuropathy and cognitive disorders.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in Triple-A patients, adrenal function can be deficient, insufficient or compensated. In our cohort after the first decade of life, there does not appear to be any degradation of adrenal function over time. However, patients with compensated adrenal function should be informed and educated to manage a glucocorticoid replacement therapy in case of stressful conditions, with no need for systematic long-term treatment.© 2018 European Society of Endocrinology."

Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006 and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was impossible to establish.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of TAS. Our cases share many clinical features of TAS and underline the variability in this syndrome, as well as the need for thorough investigation following a multidisciplinary approach. What is known: • Triple A syndrome is characterised by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, neurological impairment, and dermatological abnormalities. • A precise genotype-phenotype correlation has proved impossible to establish. What is new: • These cases add to a large number of similar case reports with limited novel information. • The newly identified AAAS gene mutation was reported."

The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the AAAS gene located on chromosome 12q13. However, the clinical picture as well as genetic testing may be complex since symptomatology is variable and mutations cannot be identified in all clinically diagnosed patients. We present two unrelated patients with triple-A syndrome illustrating the importance of alacrima as an early clinical sign.CASE PRESENTATION: A 3.5 year old girl presented with repeated hypoglycaemic myoclonic events. Adrenal insufficiency was diagnosed. In addition, alacrima, obvious since early infancy, was incidentally reported by the mother and finally lead to the clinical diagnosis of triple A syndrome. This was confirmed by positive mutation analysis of the AAAS gene. The second patient, an 8 months old boy was presented because of anisocoria and unilateral optic atrophy. MRI revealed cerebellar vermis hypotrophy. Psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, and frequent vomiting lead to further diagnostic work-up. Achalasia was diagnosed radiologically. In addition, the mother mentioned absence of tears since birth leading to the clinical diagnosis of triple A syndrome. In contrast to the first cases genetic testing was negative.CONCLUSION: These two patients illustrate the heterogeneity of triple A syndrome in both terms, clinical expression and genetic testing. We particularly aim to stress the importance of alacrima, which should be considered as a red flag symptom. Further differential diagnosis is required in every child affected by alacrima."

					"context": "Background Triple A syndrome is characterized by achalasia, alacrima and adrenal insufficiency with neurological manifestations occurring later in the course of the disease. It occurs due to biallelic mutations in the AAAS gene which codes for the nuclear pore protein ALADIN. A number of other features have been reported over time in this heterogeneous and multisystemic disorder. Unlike other autosomal recessive disorders, triple A syndrome patients show a wide phenotypic variability both among different patients and family members harboring the same mutation(s). A gene-environment interaction has been thought to be a plausible cause. Methods A retrospective analysis of six families and seven patients presenting with triple A syndrome was carried out. The clinical, biochemical and molecular testing data were collected and correlated. The results of treatment and follow-up and genetic counseling of the families were obtained wherever feasible. Results Our cohort consisted mostly of children and displayed a wide phenotypic variability in the presenting symptoms ranging from hypoglycemic seizures at the severe end of the spectrum to insidious hyperpigmentation and delayed development. Neurological and autonomic features were present in a few patients, suggesting requirement of prolonged follow-up for these patients. A significant gap between the onset of symptoms and confirmatory diagnosis was noted, suggesting that a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing this disorder. Sudden unexplained death was observed in siblings, and early diagnosis and treatment could help in preventing early mortality and improving the quality of life for these patients. Conclusion High index of suspicion for a potentially treatable disorder allows early appropriate intervention."

					"context": "BACKGROUND: Allgrove syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of achalasia, alacrimia and adrenal insufficiency. It is caused by the mutations of the AAAS gene located on chromosome 12q13. The c.1331 + 1G > A mutation is one of the most common described in North Africa including Tunisia, Algeria and Libya. We report here the clinical and genetic profile of a Moroccan family with Allgrove syndrome.CASE PRESENTATION: A Moroccan sister and brother born to consanguineous parents were found, at the ages of twelve and fifteen months old respectively, to have alacrimia and isolated glucocorticoid deficiency. Later, they developed achalasia whereupon Allgrove syndrome was diagnosed clinically and confirmed by DNA sequencing which revealed a c.1331 + 1G > A mutation in the AAAS gene.CONCLUSION: This finding reinforces previous studies in demonstrating the geographic expansion of the ancestral mutation c.1331 + 1G > A in North African patients and thus enabling targeted genetic counseling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the AAAS gene mutation in Moroccan patients."

					"context": "Hox gene clusters of jaw vertebrates display a tight genomic organization, which has no equivalent in any other bilateria genomes sequenced thus far. It was previously argued that such a topological consolidation toward a condensed, metagenic structure was due to the accumulation of long-range regulations flanking Hox loci, a phenomenon made possible by the successive genome duplications that occurred at the root of the vertebrate lineage, similar to gene neofunctionalization but applied to a coordinated multigenic system. Here, we propose that the emergence of such large vertebrate regulatory landscapes containing a range of global enhancers was greatly facilitated by the presence of topologically associating domains (TADs). These chromatin domains, mostly constitutive, may have been used as genomic niches where novel regulations could evolve due to both the preexistence of a structural backbone poised to integrate novel regulatory inputs, and a highly adaptive transcriptional readout. We propose a scenario for the coevolution of such TADs and the emergence of pleiotropy at ancestral vertebrate Hox loci."

Here, we show that the PRC2 complex is sequestered at poised enhancers, but not at active promoters with high levels of H3.3K27M proteins, thereby contributing to the global reduction of H3K27me3. Moreover, the levels of H3.3K27M proteins are low at the retained H3K27me3 peaks and consequently having minimal effects on the PRC2 activity at these loci. H3K27me3-mediated silencing at specific tumor suppressor genes, including Wilms Tumor 1, promotes proliferation of DIPG cells. These results support a model in which the PRC2 complex is redistributed to poised enhancers in H3.3K27M mutant cells and contributes to tumorigenesis in part by locally enhancing H3K27me3, and hence silencing of tumor suppressor genes."

The poised enhancer signature, involving H3K4me1 and low levels of H3K27ac, has been reported to mark inactive enhancers that are poised for future activation. However, future activation is not always observed, and alternative reasons for the widespread occurrence of this enhancer signature have not been investigated. By analyzing enhancers during dorsal-ventral (DV) axis formation in the Drosophila embryo, we find that the poised enhancer signature is specifically generated during patterning in the tissue where the enhancers are not induced, including at enhancers that are known to be repressed by a transcriptional repressor. These results suggest that, rather than serving exclusively as an intermediate step before future activation, the poised enhancer state may be a mark for spatial regulation during tissue patterning. We discuss the possibility that the poised enhancer state is more generally the result of repression by transcriptional repressors."

Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs.

We randomly selected 2,400 cohort study participants aged above 50 years, randomly assigned them to intervention or usual care and invited them to participate in an additional measurement study (if they met the eligibility criteria) to measure liver related outcomes. Those agreeing and randomized to the intervention arm were offered a daily single dose of PolyPill. We will follow participants for 5 years. The primary outcome is major cardiovascular events, secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality and liver related outcomes: liver stiffness and liver enzyme levels. Cardiovascular outcomes and mortality will be determined from the cohort study and liver-related outcomes in those consenting to follow up. Analysis will be by allocated group.TRIAL STATUS: Between October and December 2011, 1,320 intervention and 1,080 control participants were invited to participate in the additional measurement study. For all these participants, the major cardiovascular events will be determined using blind assessment of outcomes through the cohort study. In the intervention and control arms, 875 (66%) and 721 (67%) respectively, met the eligibility criteria and agreed to participate in the additional measurement study. Liver related outcomes will be measured in these participants.

To assess Tpr's role as an architectural element of the NPC, we have studied the sequential disassembly and reassembly of NPCs in mitotic cells, paralleled by studies of cells depleted of Tpr as a result of posttranscriptional tpr gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi). NPC assembly and recruitment of several nucleoporins, including Nup50, Nup93, Nup96, Nup98, Nup107, and Nup153, in anaphase/early telophase is shown to precede NPC association of Tpr in late telophase. In accordance, cellular depletion of Tpr by RNAi does not forestall binding of these nucleoporins to the NPC. In a search for proteins that moor Tpr to the NPC, we have combined the RNAi approach with affinity-chromatography and yeast two-hybrid interaction studies, leading to the identification of nucleoporin Nup153 as the binding partner for Tpr. The specificity of this interaction is demonstrated by its sensitivity to Tpr amino acid substitution mutations that abolish Tpr's ability to adhere to the NPC and affect the direct binding of Tpr to Nup153. Accordingly, cellular depletion of Nup153 by RNAi is shown to result in mislocalization of Tpr to the nuclear interior. Nup153 deficiency also causes mislocalization of Nup50 but has no direct effect on NPC localization of the other nucleoporins studied in this investigation. In summary, these results render Tpr a protein only peripherally attached to the NPC that does not act as an essential scaffold for other nucleoporins."

					"context": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is both the major conduit for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and a platform for organizing macromolecules at the nuclear envelope. We report that yeast Esc1, a non-NPC nuclear envelope protein, is required both for proper assembly of the nuclear basket, a structure extending into the nucleus from the NPC, and for normal NPC localization of the Ulp1 SUMO protease. In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. Loss of Esc1 (or Nup60) alters SUMO conjugate accumulation and enhances ulp1 mutant defects. Similar to previous findings with Mlp1, both Esc1 and Ulp1 help retain unspliced pre-mRNAs in the nucleus. Therefore, these proteins are essential for proper nuclear basket function, which includes mRNA surveillance and regulation of SUMO protein dynamics. The results raise the possibility that NPC-localized protein desumoylation may be a key regulatory event preventing inappropriate pre-mRNA export."

ADS-5102 is an extended release amantadine capsule formulation, designed for once-daily dosing at bedtime (qhs) to provide high concentrations upon waking and throughout the day, with lower concentrations in the evening. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADS-5102 were assessed in two phase I studies in healthy subjects, and a blinded, randomized phase II/III dose-finding study in PD patients.METHODS: The first phase I study assessed single ADS-5102 doses (68.5, 137, and 274 mg) in a crossover design, whereas the second phase I study evaluated ADS-5102 137 mg for 7 days followed by amantadine IR 81 mg twice daily (or reverse order). In the phase II/III double-blind study, PD patients with dyskinesia were randomized to ADS-5102 (210, 274, or 338 mg) or placebo for 8 weeks.RESULTS: Single ADS-5102 doses resulted in a slow initial rise in amantadine plasma concentration, with delayed time to maximum concentration (12-16 h). Amantadine plasma concentrations were higher in PD patients versus healthy volunteers. The steady-state profile of once-daily ADS-5102 was significantly different from that of twice-daily amantadine IR, such that the two formulations are not bioequivalent. PK modeling suggested the recommended daily ADS-5102 dosage (274 mg qhs) resulted in 1.4- to 2.0-fold higher amantadine plasma concentrations during the day versus amantadine IR.CONCLUSIONS: ADS-5102 can be administered once-daily qhs to achieve high amantadine plasma concentrations in the morning and throughout the day, when symptoms of dyskinesia occur."

The condition is characterised by a clinical triad of symptoms; homogentisic aciduria from birth, ochronosis (darkening) of collagenous tissues (from ∼30years of age) and ochronotic osteoarthropathy in weight bearing joints due to long term ochronosis in them (from ∼40years of age). Tyrosinase, a polyphenol oxidase has been shown in many species to contribute to the darkening of tissues in many organisms; including humans in the production of melanin. Tyrosinase under the right conditions shows alterations in its substrate specificity and may contribute to the darkening seen in AKU where it moves away from polymerising tyrosine but also homogentisic acid, the causative molecule in alkaptonuria, that is present in excess."

The condition has a triad of clinical features, the most damaging of which is ochronotic osteoarthropathy. HGA is elevated from birth, but pigmentation takes many years. We hypothesise that interleukins play a role in initiation and progression of ochronotic osteoarthropathy. C20/A4 cells were cultured and maintained in 9-cm petri dishes containing either HGA at 0.33 mM, a single interleukin (IL-1β, IL-6 or IL-10) at 1 ng/ml or a combination of HGA and a single interleukin. Statistical analysis of pigment deposits and cell viability was performed using analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls post-test. All cultures containing HGA showed a significant increase in pigment deposition compared to control and IL cultures alone. The cultures containing HGA and IL-6 showed a significant increase in pigment deposits compared to HGA alone. The cell viability counts across all cultures on day 10 demonstrated a significant decrease in cultures containing HGA compared to those which did not. There was no significant difference between cultures containing just HGA or those combined with an interleukin. This work demonstrates a role for cytokines present in the joint(s) in the pigmentation process, particularly IL-6, and that the presence of HGA in joint tissues appears more detrimental to chondrocytes than the presence of any of the interleukins found in response to joint injury, trauma and osteoarthritis (OA). This further supports the evidence that the arthropathy in alkaptonuria is much more severe and rapidly progressing."

In this work we report observations of 96 AKU French patients from 81 families collected in the literature since 1882 and from our personal contribution since 1986, giving an incidence of the disease of around 1:680,000 (96/64.10(6)). As expected for an autosomal recessive disorder the main findings of this study were: a slight predominance of males (51/93, 54,8%) over females (42/93, 45,2%), a strong predominance of sibships with one affected individual (68/81, 84,0%) over sibships with two (11/81, 13.6%) and three(2/81, 2.4%) affected individuals. AKU families are scaterred among the French territory suggesting that most cases occured in non-consanguineous unions. Consanguinity was only found in five families.

It is due to the deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase which catalyzes the conversion of homogentisic acid to maleylacetoacetic acid in the catabolism of tyrosine. Homogentisic acid thus accumulates in cells and body fluids and its oxidized polymers bind to collagen, leading to progressive deposition of grey to bluish black pigment resulting in degenerative changes in cartilage, intervertebral disc and other connective tissues, leading to arthritis which is the only disabling effect in an affected older individual. However the diagnosis can be made in neonates when blackish stain is noticed in an unwashed diaper.

V600E is the most frequent somatic point mutation in metastatic melanoma, providing a unique molecular marker for this malignancy. In addition, tumors carrying this mutation are primary candidates for BRAF-targeted therapy. Although metastatic melanoma patients usually have sufficient tumor tissue available for genetic analyses, the detection of V600E in blood can have prognostic and predictive value. In addition, patients are rarely re-biopsied and genetic testing in blood can be useful for monitoring response to therapy. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cell-free RNA (cfRNA), RNA associated to platelets and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are some of the materials that can be derived from the blood of cancer patients. cfDNA can be easily purified from serum and plasma and contains DNA fragments of tumor origin. For this reason, it is the most widely used material for the detection of somatic mutations in blood.

					"context": "Precision oncology is predicated upon the ability to detect specific actionable genomic alterations and to monitor their adaptive evolution during treatment to counter resistance. Because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity and comorbidities associated with obtaining tumor tissues, especially in the case of metastatic disease, traditional methods for tumor sampling are impractical for this application. Known to be present in the blood of cancer patients for decades, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is beginning to inform on tumor genetics, tumor burden, and mechanisms of progression and drug resistance. This substrate is amenable for inexpensive noninvasive testing and thus presents a viable approach to serial sampling for screening and monitoring tumor progression. The fragmentation, low yield, and variable admixture of normal DNA present formidable technical challenges for realization of this potential. This review summarizes the history of cfDNA discovery, its biological properties, and explores emerging technologies for clinically relevant sequence-based analysis of cfDNA in cancer patients. Molecular barcoding (or Unique Molecular Identifier, UMI)-based methods currently appear to offer an optimal balance between sensitivity, flexibility, and cost and constitute a promising approach for clinically relevant assays for near real-time monitoring of treatment-induced mutational adaptations to guide evidence-based precision oncology.

					"context": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the principal factors contributing to the cost of avoiding a birth with Down syndrome by using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to replace conventional screening.METHODS: A range of unit costs were assigned to each item in the screening process. Detection rates were estimated by meta-analysis and modeling. The marginal cost associated with the detection of additional cases using cfDNA was estimated from the difference in average costs divided by the difference in detection.RESULTS: The main factor was the unit cost of cfDNA testing. For example, replacing a combined test costing $150 with 3% false-positive rate and invasive testing at $1000, by cfDNA tests at $2000, $1500, $1000, and $500, the marginal cost is $8.0, $5.8, $3.6, and $1.4m, respectively. Costs were lower when replacing a quadruple test and higher for a 5% false-positive rate, but the relative importance of cfDNA unit cost was unchanged. A contingent policy whereby 10% to 20% women were selected for cfDNA testing by conventional screening was considerably more cost-efficient. Costs were sensitive to cfDNA uptake.CONCLUSION: Universal cfDNA screening for Down syndrome will only become affordable by public health purchasers if costs fall substantially. Until this happens, the contingent use of cfDNA is recommended.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

With the introduction of new drugs the need to identify nonresponders is increasing. To our knowledge there are no prognostic parameters to date for use upon the initiation of any treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: cfDNA was isolated from a serum specimen before chemotherapy. Its value was correlated to recurrence-free and overall survival using Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors.RESULTS: Of 59 men 48 (81.4%) had a measurable prostate specific antigen decrease from baseline. Median followup was 15.0 months (range 2.4 to 58.4). The median cfDNA concentration in all men in this study was 27.71 ng/ml (mean 32.64). A threshold of 55.03 ng/ml was significantly associated with a poor prostate specific antigen response of less than 30% (p = 0.005). On univariate and multivariate analysis circulating cfDNA was an independent predictor of overall survival (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.97, p = 0.044 and HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.91, p = 0.032, respectively). Limitations of the study are its retrospective character, and first and second line therapies.CONCLUSIONS: Our trial shows that the cfDNA concentration before therapy may be a useful predictive and prognostic biomarker for prostate specific antigen response and survival.Copyright © 2015 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

Fetal monogenic diseases have also been shown to be amenable to non-invasive detection by maternal plasma DNA analysis. A number of recent technological developments in this area has increased the level of clinical interest, particularly as one approach does not require customized reagents per mutation. The mutational status of the fetus can be assessed by determining which parental haplotype that fetus has inherited based on the detection of haplotype-associated SNP alleles in maternal plasma. Such relative haplotype dosage analysis requires the input of the parental haplotype information for interpretation of the fetal inheritance pattern from the maternal plasma DNA data. The parental haplotype information can be obtained by direct means, reducing the need to infer haplotypes using DNA from other family members. The technique also allows the assessment of complex mutations and has multiplexing capabilities where a number of genes and mutations can be assessed at the same time. These advantages allow non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal monogenic diseases to be much more scalable. These applications may drive the next wave of clinical adoption of cell-free fetal DNA testing."

The mean ages of the participants were 31.2 ± 13.1 years and 32.3 ± 18.1 years, respectively. The male/female ratios were 24/6 and 26/4, respectively, in the case and control groups. Randomization was based on a single sequence of random assignments using computer-generated random numbers. Group I was given oral amantadine 100 mg 1 hour before surgery, and group II received a placebo at the identical time. Through PCA pumps, patients received a bolus dose of morphine at 0.02 mg/kg body weight, to a maximum of 1.5 mg. PCA pumps were set at 6 minutes lockout intervals and a maximum dose of 0.15 mg/kg/h, to a maximum of 10 mg/h. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months after surgery. The amounts of analgesic consumed were recorded for the first 24 hours, and for 6 months after surgery.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to age, gender, nausea and vomiting, sleep quality, blood pressure, and heart rate. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in pain scores (P = 0.39) and analgesic consumption (P = 0.78).CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a single dose of preoperative oral amantadine did not reduce acute or chronic postoperative pain, nor analgesic consumption."

					"context": "External-beam radiotherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of most pediatric solid tumors. Particularly in children, achieving an optimal therapeutic index to avoid damage to normal tissue is extremely important. Consequently, in metastatic disease, the utility of external-beam radiotherapy is limited. Molecular radiotherapy with tumor-targeted radionuclides may overcome some of these challenges, but to date there exists no single cancer-selective agent capable of treating various pediatric malignancies independently of their histopathologic origin. We tested the therapeutic potential of the clinical-grade alkyl-phospholipid ether analog CLR1404, 18-(p-iodophenyl)octadecyl phosphocholine, as a scaffold for tumor-targeted radiotherapy of pediatric malignancies. Methods: Uptake of CLR1404 by pediatric solid tumor cells was tested in vitro by flow cytometry and in vivo by PET/CT imaging and dosimetry. The therapeutic potential of 131I-CLR1404 was evaluated in xenograft models. Results: In vitro, fluorescent CLR1404-BODIPY showed significant selective uptake in a variety of pediatric cancer lines compared with normal controls. In vivo tumor-targeted uptake in mouse xenograft models using 124I-CLR1404 was confirmed by imaging. Single-dose intravenous injection of 131I-CLR1404 significantly delayed tumor growth in all rodent pediatric xenograft models and extended animal survival while demonstrating a favorable side effect profile. Conclusion:131I-CLR1404 has the potential to become a tumor-targeted radiotherapeutic drug with broad applicability in pediatric oncology. Because 131I-CLR1404 has entered clinical trials in adults, our data warrant the development of pediatric clinical trials for this particularly vulnerable patient population."

This study used immunohistochemistry to evaluate target expression in archival neuroblastoma tissue, to determine whether it might facilitate clinical use of molecular radiotherapy.METHODS: Tissue bank samples of formalin fixed paraffin embedded neuroblastoma tissue from patients for whom clinical outcome data were available were sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and monoclonal antibodies directed against NAT and SSTR2. Sections were examined blinded to clinical information and scored for the percentage and intensity of tumour cells stained. These data were analysed in conjunction with clinical data.RESULTS: Tissue from 75 patients was examined. Target expression scores varied widely between patients: NAT median 45%, inter-quartile range 25% - 65%; and SSTR2 median 55%, interquartile range 30% - 80%; and in some cases heterogeneity of expression between different parts of a tumour was observed. A weak positive correlation was observed between the expression scores of the different targets: correlation coefficient = 0.23, p = 0.05. MYCN amplified tumours had lower SSTR2 scores: mean difference 23% confidence interval 8% - 39%, p < 0.01. Survival did not differ by scores.CONCLUSIONS: As expression of both targets is variable and heterogeneous, imaging assessment of both may yield more clinical information than either alone. The clinical value of immunohistochemical assessment of target expression requires prospective evaluation. Variable target expression within a patient may contribute to treatment failure."

Secondary prevention guidelines recommend that antihypertensive, statin and antiplatelet therapy be initiated promptly after ischemic stroke and adhered to in a persistent fashion to achieve optimal vascular-risk reduction. However, these goals are seldom realized in routine clinical care settings in SSA due to logistical challenges. We seek to assess whether a polypill containing fixed doses of three antihypertensive agents, a statin and antiplatelet therapy taken once daily per os for 12 months among recent stroke survivors would result in carotid intimal thickness regression compared with usual care (UC).METHODS: The Stroke Minimization through Additive Anti-atherosclerotic Agents in Routine Treatment (SMAART) trial is a phase 2, open-label, evaluator-blinded trial involving 120 Ghanaian recent-ischemic-stroke survivors. Using a computer-generated sequence, patients will be randomly allocated 1:1 into either the intervention arm or UC. Patients in the intervention arm will receive Polycap DS® (containing aspirin, 100 mg; atenolol, 50 mg; ramipril, 5 mg; thiazide, 12.5 mg; simvastatin, 20 mg) taken as two capsules once daily. Patients in the UC will receive separate, individual secondary preventive medications prescribed at the physician's discretion. Both groups will be followed for 12 months to assess changes in carotid intimal thickness regression - a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis - as primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include adherence to therapy, safety and tolerability, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, functional status, depression and cognitive dysfunction.DISCUSSION: An efficacy-suggesting SMAART trial could inform the future design of a multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial comparing the clinical efficacy of the polypill strategy for vascular risk moderation among stroke survivors in SSA.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov , ID: NCT03329599 .

					"context": "BACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that in individuals without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), but at increased CVD risk, a 50% to 60% reduction in CVD risk could be achieved using fixed dose combination (FDC) therapy (usually comprised of multiple blood-pressure agents and a statin [with or without aspirin]) in a single \"polypill\". However, the impact of a polypill in preventing clinical CV events has not been evaluated in a large randomized controlled trial.METHODS: TIPS-3 is a 2x2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial that will examine the effect of a FDC polypill on major CV outcomes in a primary prevention population. This study aims to determine whether the Polycap (comprised of atenolol, ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide, and a statin) reduces CV events in persons without a history of CVD, but who are at least at intermediate CVD risk. Additional interventions in the factorial design of the study will compare the effect of (1) aspirin versus placebo on CV events (and cancer), (2) vitamin D versus placebo on the risk of fractures, and (3) the combined effect of aspirin and the Polycap on CV events.RESULTS: The study has randomized 5713 participants across 9 countries. Mean age of the study population is 63.9 years, and 53% are female. Mean INTERHEART risk score is 16.8, which is consistent with a study population at intermediate CVD risk.CONCLUSION: Results of the TIP-3 study will be key to determining the appropriateness of FDC therapy as a strategy in the global prevention of CVD.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01646437.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We examined the incremental effects of 2 (full dose) plus K(+) supplementation versus single polycap (low dose) on risk factors and tolerability.METHODS AND RESULTS: After a run-in period, 518 individuals with previous vascular disease or diabetes mellitus from 27 centers in India were randomly assigned to a single-dose polycap or to 2 capsules of the polycap plus K(+) supplementation for 8 weeks. The effects on BP, heart rate (HR), serum lipids, serum and urinary K(+), and tolerability were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis. The full-dose polycap (plus K(+) supplementation) reduced BP by a further 2.8 mm Hg systolic and 1.7 mm Hg diastolic, compared with that observed with the low-dose polycap (P=0.003; P=0.001), but there were no differences in HR (0.1 bpm). The differences in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol between the full-dose and low-dose polycap was 7.2 mg/dL (P=0.014) and 6.6 mg/dL (P=0.006), respectively, but there were no differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. The rates of discontinuation of the study drug after randomization were similar in the 2 groups (6.9% low dose versus 7.8% full dose).CONCLUSIONS: The full-dose polycap (plus K(+) supplementation) reduces BP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a greater extent compared with the low dose, with similar tolerability. Therefore, the full-dose polycap should potentially lead to larger benefits. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://www.ctri.nic.in. Unique identifier: CTRI/2010/091/000054."

Plasma concentrations of each drug and, where applicable, its active metabolite were measured using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters and their standard deviations were computed for each analyte.RESULTS: Comparative bioavailability was computed and no drug-drug interactions and no difference in comparative bioavailability were concluded for each ingredient based on point estimates of the T/R ratio of the geometric means falling within 80-125% for peak plasma concentration (C(max)), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC(t)), and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)). The T/R ratio for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) was within 80-125% for atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, ramiprilat and dose-normalized salicylic acid. However, for simvastatin, the T/R point estimates for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) for Ln-transformed data were significantly lower ( approximately 3-4%) than the lower bound of 80%. For its active metabolite, simvastatin acid, these estimates were significantly higher ( approximately 25-35%) than the higher bound of 125%. Thus, the increased bioavailability of active simvastatin acid appeared to compensate for the loss of bioavailability of simvastatin.CONCLUSION: The Polycap was found to be effective and safe in the previously published TIPS trial. The present study in healthy volunteers establishes that Polycap is safe (no serious adverse events) and well tolerated, and that there is no indication of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions for any of the ingredients, with their bioavailabilities being well preserved."

It is believed that the polypill would have several advantages over the separate use of several medications, enhancing acceptability and long-term adherence, with lower cost and easier accessibility. However, there are few data available on the efficacy and safety of polypill preparations for preventive purposes. The Indian Polycap Study (TIPS) was the first to systematically test the clinical application of the polypill; it included ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, aspirin, and simvastatin. Blood pressure and LDL levels were effectively lowered and antiplatelet function was demonstrated, but the effect of simvastatin was reduced because of an unexpected drug interaction. The polypill was well tolerated. Challenges to be resolved include the need to demonstrate conclusively the safety and efficacy of the polypill in large clinical end point trials."

The primary outcomes were LDL for the effect of lipids, blood pressure for antihypertensive drugs, heart rate for the effects of atenolol, urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 for the antiplatelet effects of aspirin, and rates of discontinuation of drugs for safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00443794.FINDINGS: Compared with groups not receiving blood-pressure-lowering drugs, the Polycap reduced systolic blood pressure by 7.4 mm Hg (95% CI 6.1-8.1) and diastolic blood pressure by 5.6 mm Hg (4.7-6.4), which was similar when three blood-pressure-lowering drugs were used, with or without aspirin. Reductions in blood pressure increased with the number of drugs used (2.2/1.3 mm Hg with one drug, 4.7/3.6 mm Hg with two drugs, and 6.3/4.5 mm Hg with three drugs). Polycap reduced LDL cholesterol by 0.70 mmol/L (95% CI 0.62-0.78), which was less than that with simvastatin alone (0.83 mmol/L, 0.72-0.93; p=0.04); both reductions were greater than for groups without simvastatin (p<0.0001). The reductions in heart rate with Polycap and other groups using atenolol were similar (7.0 beats per min), and both were significantly greater than that in groups without atenolol (p<0.0001). The reductions in 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 were similar with the Polycap (283.1 ng/mmol creatinine, 95% CI 229.1-337.0) compared with the three blood-pressure-lowering drugs plus aspirin (350.0 ng/mmol creatinine, 294.6-404.0), and aspirin alone (348.8 ng/mmol creatinine, 277.6-419.9) compared with groups without aspirin. Tolerability of the Polycap was similar to that of other treatments, with no evidence of increasing intolerability with increasing number of active components in one pill.INTERPRETATION: This Polycap formulation could be conveniently used to reduce multiple risk factors and cardiovascular risk."

Different types of breeds are subjected to different selection intensities and had different selection signatures. Selective sweep analysis is one of major methods to detect the selection signatures. In this study, based on the 60K BeadChip genotyping data of both commercial Large White (n=45) and local Tongcheng pigs (n=45), genetic differentiation coefficient Fst was applied to detect the selection signatures. Using gPLINK software to set quality control standards, a total of 34 304 SNPs were selected for statistical analysis. Fst values between two breeds were estimated with Genepop package and the average Fst value was 0.3209. Setting Fst>0.7036 (1% of total number of Fst values) as selection threshold, 344 SNPs were obtained and SNP location annotation indicated that there were 79 candidate genes (Sus scrofa Build 9). Furthermore, network analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the preliminary results suggested that most genes were involved in growth, reproduction, and immune response, such as NCOA6, ERBB4, RUNX2, and APOB genes.

					"context": "BACKGROUND: Adaptive alleles may rise in frequency as a consequence of positive selection, creating a pattern of decreased variation in the neighboring loci, known as a selective sweep. When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population.FINDINGS: SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and divergence patterns consistent with selection sweeps by evaluating allele frequencies in windows, including neighboring loci from two or more populations of a diploid species against the genome-wide neutral expectation. The program calculates the mean of heterozygosity and FST in a set of sliding windows of incrementally increasing sizes, and then builds a resampled distribution (the baseline) of random multi-locus sets matched to the sizes of sliding windows, using an unrestricted sampling. Percentiles of the values in the sliding windows are derived from the superimposed resampled distribution. The resampling can easily be scaled from 1 K to 100 M; the higher the number, the more precise the percentiles ascribed to the extreme observed values.CONCLUSIONS: The output from SmileFinder can be used to plot percentile values to look for population diversity and divergence patterns that may suggest past actions of positive selection along chromosome maps, and to compare lists of suspected candidate genes under random gene sets to test for the overrepresentation of these patterns among gene categories. Both applications of the algorithm have already been used in published studies. Here we present a publicly available, open source program that will serve as a useful tool for preliminary scans of selection using worldwide databases of human genetic variation, as well as population datasets for many non-human species, from which such data is rapidly emerging with the advent of new genotyping and sequencing technologies."

					"context": "BACKGROUND: Linkage disequilibrium is defined as the non-random associations of alleles at different loci, and it occurs when genotypes at the two loci depend on each other. The model of genetic hitchhiking predicts that strong positive selection affects the patterns of linkage disequilibrium around the site of a beneficial allele, resulting in specific motifs of correlation between neutral polymorphisms that surround the fixed beneficial allele. Increased levels of linkage disequilibrium are observed on the same side of a beneficial allele, and diminish between sites on different sides of a beneficial mutation. This specific pattern of linkage disequilibrium occurs more frequently when positive selection has acted on the population rather than under various neutral models. Thus, detecting such patterns could accurately reveal targets of positive selection along a recombining chromosome or a genome. Calculating linkage disequilibria in whole genomes is computationally expensive because allele correlations need to be evaluated for millions of pairs of sites. To analyze large datasets efficiently, algorithmic implementations used in modern population genetics need to exploit multiple cores of current workstations in a scalable way. However, population genomic datasets come in various types and shapes while typically showing SNP density heterogeneity, which makes the implementation of generally scalable parallel algorithms a challenging task.FINDINGS: Here we present a series of four parallelization strategies targeting shared-memory systems for the computationally intensive problem of detecting genomic regions that have contributed to the past adaptation of the species, also referred to as regions that have undergone a selective sweep, based on linkage disequilibrium patterns. We provide a thorough performance evaluation of the proposed parallel algorithms for computing linkage disequilibrium, and outline the benefits of each approach. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of our open-source sweep-detection software OmegaPlus, which implements all four parallelization strategies presented here, with a variety of neutrality tests.CONCLUSIONS: The computational demands of selective sweep detection algorithms depend greatly on the SNP density heterogeneity and the data representation. Choosing the right parallel algorithm for the analysis can lead to significant processing time reduction and major energy savings. However, determining which parallel algorithm will execute more efficiently on a specific processor architecture and number of available cores for a particular dataset is not straightforward."

					"context": "Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use combinations of statistics, maximum likelihood, machine learning etc. In this survey, we present and discuss summary statistics and software tools, and classify them based on the selective sweep signature they detect, i.e., SFS-based vs. LD-based, as well as their capacity to analyze whole genomes or just subgenomic regions. Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons among four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, and OmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times. In equilibrium neutral models or mild bottlenecks, both SFS- and LD-based methods are able to detect selective sweeps accurately. Methods and tools that rely on LD exhibit higher true positive rates than SFS-based ones under the model of a single sweep or recurrent hitchhiking. However, their false positive rate is elevated when a misspecified demographic model is used to represent the null hypothesis. When the correct (or similar to the correct) demographic model is used instead, the false positive rates are considerably reduced. The accuracy of detecting the true target of selection is decreased in bottleneck scenarios. In terms of execution time, LD-based methods are typically faster than SFS-based methods, due to the nature of required arithmetic."

Thus, our findings uncover a fork protection function of AND-1/Ctf4 manifested via the WD40 domain that is essential for proliferation and averts genome instability."

					"context": "BACKGROUND: Although levodopa is considered the most effective pharmacotherapy for motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), chronic use is associated with motor complications, including fluctuating response and unpredictable, involuntary movements called dyskinesia. ADS-5102 (amantadine) extended-release (ER) capsules (GOCOVRITM) is a recent US FDA-approved treatment for dyskinesia in PD patients. ADS-5102 is a high-dose, ER formulation of amantadine, administered orally once daily at bedtime, that achieves high plasma drug concentrations throughout the day.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we present pooled results from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III ADS-5102 trials.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The two studies in PD patients with dyskinesia shared design and eligibility criteria, differing only in treatment duration. Results from common assessment time points were pooled.RESULTS: At 12 weeks, the least squares (LS) mean change in total score on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale among 100 patients randomized to ADS-5102 and 96 patients randomized to placebo was - 17.7 (standard error [SE] 1.3) vs. - 7.6 (1.3) points, respectively (- 10.1 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 13.8, - 6.5; p < 0.0001). The relative treatment difference between groups was 27.3% (p < 0.0001). At 12 weeks, the LS mean change in OFF time was - 0.59 (0.21) vs. +0.41 (0.20) h/day, a difference of - 1.00 h/day (95% CI - 1.57, - 0.44; p = 0.0006). For both efficacy measures, a significant difference from placebo was attained by two weeks, the first post-baseline assessment, and was maintained throughout 12 weeks. In the pooled ADS-5102 group, the most common adverse events were hallucination, dizziness, dry mouth, peripheral edema, constipation, falls, and orthostatic hypotension.CONCLUSIONS: These analyses provide further evidence supporting ADS-5102 as an adjunct to levodopa for treating both dyskinesia and OFF time in PD patients with dyskinesia. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02136914 and NCT02274766."

					"context": "PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible diagnostic role of the combined performance of BRAF mutation analysis and MIBI scintigraphy in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients with incomplete bio-chemical response to first radioiodine therapy (RAIT) performed for thyroid remnant ablation.METHODS: The records of 15 PTC patients with bio-chemical incomplete response to first RAIT were retrospectively analyzed. BRAFV600E analysis on primary tumor samples was obtained in all cases along with neck ultrasonography and 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy of the neck-thorax regions at first follow-up. All patients then underwent RAIT with high radioiodine activities. A post-therapy whole-body scan (pT-WBS) was acquired 5-7 days after RAIT.RESULTS: Abnormal radioiodine uptake was found in 10 out of the 15 patients (67%, 131I+ve), while in the remaining 33%, no abnormal radioiodine uptake was detected (5/15, 131I-ve). Abnormal tracer uptake was found in 6 out of 10 131I+ve patients at 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy (MIBI+ve). BRAFV600E mutation was not found in the majority of 131I+ve patients (9 out of 10 BRAFV600E-ve). On the contrary, in the 5 131I-ve patients, 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy did not show any abnormal tracer uptake (MIBI-ve), while BRAFV600E mutation was present (BRAFV600E+ve). Thus, in our series, the association between MIBI-ve scintigraphy and BRAF+ve mutation was a useful diagnostic tool in predicting negative pT-WBS outcome.CONCLUSION: Albeit obtained in a small retrospective series, our results suggest that the combination of BRAFV600E+ve mutation and MIBI-ve scintigraphy may be considered a negative prognostic clue, which predicts the absence of radioiodine uptake at pT-WBS in DTC patients with incomplete bio-chemical response to first RAIT."

					"context": "Radioiodine ablation (RIA) therapy is one of the most important treatments for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), but some patients who received (131)I have radioiodine-refractory disease caused by the decreased expression of the Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS). BRAF(V600E) mutation is one possible risk factor that can disturb the NIS expression, but the roles are unclear in clinical practice. This research discussed the association of BRAF(V600E) mutation and NIS expression in PTC tissue and the clinical implications in RIA therapy. 134 PTC samples were collected between June 2013 and June 2014 from Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College, and their clinical characteristics were analyzed. RT-PCR was used to detect the BRAF(V600E) mutation from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and immunohistochemistry was applied to detect the NIS expression. IPP software was used to calculate the relative expression quantity of NIS. We found that there was no significant correlation between the absorbance (A) values of NIS and clinicopathologic features in these cases, even thyroid stimulating hormone. BRAF(V600E) mutation showed inhibitory effect on the NIS expression without statistically significant difference in all PTC cases (β=-0.0195, P=0.085), but in the subgroup without hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), BRAF(V600E) mutation could significantly inhibit the NIS expression (β=-0.0257, P=0.046). The results indicate that BRAF(V600E) mutation is correlated with a lower expression of NIS in PTCs without HT, suggesting the radioiodine-refractory effects during RIA therapy in these patients."

					"context": "CONTEXT: It has been suggested that patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) harbouring the BRAF(V600E)  mutation have a worse prognosis. We showed in PTC that high levels of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its cognate receptor (uPAR) inversely correlate with disease-free interval (DFI).OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of BRAF(V600E)  on the expression of uPA and uPAR and to evaluate the prognostic relevance of BRAF(V600E)  alone or in combination with uPA and uPAR. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS/INTERVENTION: The case study included 91 patients with PTC. All patients underwent thyroidectomy and radioiodine therapy. Follow-up was available for 75 patients.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The BRAF(V600E)  mutation was analysed by sequencing and mutant allele-specific PCR amplification; uPA and uPAR expression by quantitative RT-PCR.RESULTS: BRAF(V600E)  was found in 44 of the 91 patients and associated with older age, but not with high-risk clinicopathological features. Urokinase PA and uPAR mRNA levels were higher in tumour tissues by 9·51 ± 1·30 and 4·64 ± 0·44 fold, respectively, compared to normal matched tissues, being significantly higher in BRAF(V600E) -positive patients. In vitro induction of BRAF(V600E)  in PCCL3 cells caused a significant increase in both uPA and uPAR mRNAs. Higher levels of uPA and uPAR correlated with lymph node metastases, TNM stage and disease recurrences. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses demonstrated that uPA and uPAR were associated with shorter DFI, while the BRAF(V600E)  was not.CONCLUSION: In PTC, BRAF(V600E)  induces uPA and uPAR expression. The latter, but not BRAF(V600E) , associates with advanced stages and shorter DFI. If confirmed in larger case studies, they may represent reliable prognostic markers for more accurate risk stratification and postoperative decision-making in patients with PTC.© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
