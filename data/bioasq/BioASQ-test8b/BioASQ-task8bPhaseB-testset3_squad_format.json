Autophagy is tightly regulated by several upstream proteins including UNC-51-like kinase 1/2, beclin1, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 34 and autophagy/beclin1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1). Recently, we revealed that both cortical and brainstem-type Lewy bodies were immunopositive for several upstream proteins of autophagy. Therefore, we conducted the present study to elucidate the role of upstream proteins of autophagy in the pathogenesis of MSA. Pathological and biochemical analyses using human brain samples revealed that AMBRA1 is a component of the pathological hallmarks of MSA and upstream proteins of autophagy are impaired in the MSA brain. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed a ninefold stronger affinity of AMBRA1 with α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 compared with non-phosphorylated α-synuclein. Furthermore, a weak but significant correlation between AMBRA1 overexpression and reduction of abnormal α-synuclein was observed. Silencing AMBRA1 function caused aggregates of α-synuclein in the cytoplasm of mouse primary cultured neurons, which was simulated by the treatment of Bafilomycin, an autophagy inhibitor. Our results demonstrated for the first time that AMBRA1 is a novel hub binding protein of α-synuclein and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of MSA through the degradative dynamics of α-synuclein.

Romiplostim (ROM) is a thrombopoietin (TPO)-receptor-agonist approved for treatment of adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The immature platelet fraction (IPF) is a novel measure of newly produced platelets, which could aid with the diagnostic evaluation of thrombocytopenic neonates. This study had the following two objectives: (1) compare the response of newborn and adult mice to escalating doses of ROM in vivo and (2) assess the correlation between IPF and megakaryocyte (MK) mass in newborn and adult treated and untreated mice. In the first set of studies, newborn (day 1) and adult mice received a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of ROM ranging from 0 to 300 ng/g, and platelet counts were followed every other day for 14 days. Both sets of mice responded with dose-dependent platelet and IPF increases, peaking on days 5-7 post-treatment, but neonates had a blunted response (2.1-fold compared to 4.2-fold maximal increase in platelet counts, respectively). On day 5 post-treatment with 300 ng/g ROM, MKs in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen of adult mice were significantly increased in numbers and size (p < 0.0001 for both) compared to controls. MKs in the spleen and BM (but not liver) of treated neonates also increased in number, but not in size. The immature platelet count (IPC, calculated as IPF x platelet count) was highly correlated with the MK number and size in neonatal and adult BM and spleen, but not neonatal liver. The lack of response of neonatal liver MKs was not due to a cell-intrinsic reduced responsiveness to TPO, since neonatal liver progenitors were more sensitive to murine TPO (mTPO) in vitro than adult BM progenitor. In vivo treatment of newborn mice with high mTPO doses or with higher doses of ROM (900 ng/g) resulted in peak platelet counts approaching 3-fold of controls. Taken together, our data indicate that newborn mice are less responsive to ROM than adult mice in vivo, due to a combination of likely pharmacokinetic differences and developmental differences in the response of MKs to thrombopoietic stimulation, evidenced by neonatal MKs increasing in numbers but not in size.

Using interactive response technology to assign numbers linked to treatment arms, patients (age 18-60 years) with SPMS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 3·0-6·5 were randomly assigned (2:1) to once daily oral siponimod 2 mg or placebo for up to 3 years or until the occurrence of a prespecified number of confirmed disability progression (CDP) events. The primary endpoint was time to 3-month CDP. Efficacy was assessed for the full analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned and treated patients); safety was assessed for the safety set.

Although most MS patients have a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS) at disease onset, a substantial proportion later develop chronic progression, termed secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Approximately 10% of MS patients experience chronic progression from disease onset, termed primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Although several disease-modifying treatment (DMT) options exist for relapsing forms of this disease, DMT options are few for progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS). Herein, we strive to define progressive MS, review major clinical trials aimed at progressive MS, and delineate potential strategies in the management of progressive MS.RECENT FINDINGS: In 2017, the first DMT for PPMS, the B lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody, ocrelizumab, came to market. Ocrelizumab reduced 12-week confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 24% versus placebo. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, reduced 3-month CDP by 21% versus placebo in SPMS. Ibudilast slowed brain atrophy in PPMS and SPMS patients in a multicenter phase 2b study. Smaller early phase studies of alpha-lipoic acid and simvastatin each found slowing of rate of whole brain atrophy in SPMS patients.

In rats, despite sustained VEC activation, the transient mitotic and PLGF2 stimuli did not result in the formation of HSA. In vitro, the mouse and rat primary endothelial cell cultures mirrored their respective in vivo findings for cell proliferation and PLGF2 release. Human VECs, like rat cells, were unresponsive to siponimod treatment with no proliferative response and no release of PLGF2 at all tested concentrations.

Reducing the Nipped-B dosage decreases the amount of stable cohesin without affecting its chromosomal residence time, and reducing the Pds5 dosage increases the amount of stable cohesin. This argues that Nipped-B and Pds5 regulate transcription by controlling how much cohesin binds DNA in the stable mode, and not binding affinity. We also found that Nipped-B, Pds5, and the Wapl protein that interacts with Pds5 all play unique roles in cohesin chromosome binding."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Translocation ability is suppressed in the presence of Wapl-Pds5 and Sororin", "answer_start": 511}], "question": "What is the interaction between WAPL and PDS5 proteins?", "id": "5d35c070b3a6380763000006_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Cohesin is a ring-shaped protein complex that plays a crucial role in sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression. The dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin is essential for these functions. However, the exact nature of cohesin dynamics, particularly cohesin translocation, remains unclear. We evaluated the dynamics of individual cohesin molecules on DNA and found that the cohesin core complex possesses an intrinsic ability to traverse DNA in an adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-dependent manner. Translocation ability is suppressed in the presence of Wapl-Pds5 and Sororin; this suppression is alleviated by the acetylation of cohesin and the action of mitotic kinases. In Xenopus laevis egg extracts, cohesin is translocated on unreplicated DNA in an ATPase- and Smc3 acetylation-dependent manner. Cohesin movement changes from bidirectional to unidirectional when cohesin faces DNA replication; otherwise, it is incorporated into replicating DNA without being translocated or is dissociated from replicating DNA This study provides insight into the nature of individual cohesin dynamics and the mechanisms by which cohesin achieves cohesion in different chromatin contexts."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " the cohesin unloading factor WAPL and its PDS5 binding partners control the length of loops.", "answer_start": 529}], "question": "What is the interaction between WAPL and PDS5 proteins?", "id": "5d35c070b3a6380763000006_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Mammalian genomes are spatially organized into compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and loops to facilitate gene regulation and other chromosomal functions.

Here, we show that cohesin suppresses compartments but is required for TADs and loops, that CTCF defines their boundaries, and that the cohesin unloading factor WAPL and its PDS5 binding partners control the length of loops. In the absence of WAPL and PDS5 proteins, cohesin forms extended loops, presumably by passing CTCF sites, accumulates in axial chromosomal positions (vermicelli), and condenses chromosomes. Unexpectedly, PDS5 proteins are also required for boundary function.

Pds5 is also essential for sister chromatid cohesion, indicating that it has functions beyond cohesin removal. The Brca2 DNA repair protein interacts with Pds5, but the roles of this complex beyond DNA repair are unknown.

By genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation we find that Pds5 facilitates SA cohesin subunit association with DNA replication origins and that Brca2 inhibits SA binding, mirroring their effects on sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin binding is maximal at replication origins and extends outward to occupy active genes and regulatory sequences.

Changes to the DIS definition included removal of the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions, increasing the number of lesions needed to define periventricular involvement to three, combining cortical and juxtacortical lesions, and inclusion of optic nerve evaluation. For DIT, removal of the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions was suggested. We compared the performance of the 2010 McDonald and 2016 MAGNIMS criteria for multiple sclerosis diagnosis in a large multicentre cohort of patients with CIS to provide evidence to guide revisions of multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria.METHODS: Brain and spinal cord MRI and optic nerve assessments from patients with typical CIS suggestive of multiple sclerosis done less than 3 months from clinical onset in eight European multiple sclerosis centres were included in this retrospective study. Eligible patients were 16-60 years, and had a first CIS suggestive of CNS demyelination and typical of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, a complete neurological examination, a baseline brain and spinal cord MRI scan obtained less than 3 months from clinical onset, and a follow-up brain scan obtained less than 12 months from CIS onset. We recorded occurrence of a second clinical attack (clinically definite multiple sclerosis) at months 36 and 60. We evaluated MRI criteria performance for DIS, DIT, and DIS plus DIT with a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.FINDINGS: Between June 16, 1995, and Jan 27, 2017, 571 patients with CIS were screened, of whom 368 met all study inclusion criteria. At the last evaluation (median 50·0 months [IQR 27·0-78·4]), 189 (51%) of 368 patients developed clinically definite multiple sclerosis. At 36 months, the two DIS criteria showed high sensitivity (2010 McDonald 0·91 [95% CI 0·85-0·94] and 2016 MAGNIMS 0·93 [0·88-0·96]), similar specificity (0·33 [0·25-0·42] and 0·32 [0·24-0·41]), and similar area under the curve values (AUC; 0·62 [0·57-0·67] and 0·63 [0·58-0·67]). Performance was not affected by inclusion of symptomatic lesions (sensitivity 0·92 [0·87-0·96], specificity 0·31 [0·23-0·40], AUC 0·62 [0·57-0·66]) or cortical lesions (sensitivity 0·92 [0·87-0·95], specificity 0·32 [0·24-0·41], AUC 0·62 [0·57-0·67]). Requirement of three periventricular lesions resulted in slightly lower sensitivity (0·85 [0·78-0·90], slightly higher specificity (0·40 [0·32-0·50], and similar AUC (0·63 [0·57-0·68]). Inclusion of optic nerve evaluation resulted in similar sensitivity (0·92 [0·87-0·96]), and slightly lower specificity (0·26 [0·18-0·34]) and AUC (0·59 [0·55-0·64]). AUC values were also similar for DIT (2010 McDonald 0·61 [0·55-0·67] and 2016 MAGNIMS 0·61 [0·55-0·66]) and DIS plus DIT (0·62 [0·56-0·67] and 0·64 [0·58-0·69]).INTERPRETATION: The 2016 MAGNIMS criteria showed similar accuracy to the 2010 McDonald criteria in predicting the development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Inclusion of symptomatic lesions is expected to simplify the clinical use of MRI criteria without reducing accuracy, and our findings suggest that needing three lesions to define periventricular involvement might slightly increase specificity, suggesting that these two factors could be considered during further revisions of multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria.FUNDING: UK MS Society, National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Dutch MS Research Foundation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the pattern of MRI lesions and contributions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum antibody findings that best identifies children with multiple sclerosis, and the applicability of international diagnostic criteria in the paediatric context.METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, detailed clinical assessments, serum and CSF studies, and MRI scans were done in youth (aged 0·46-17·87 years) with incidental acquired demyelinating syndrome. Participants were examined prospectively to identify relapsing disease. All MRI scans were assessed using a validated scoring method. A random forest classifier identified imaging and laboratory features that best predicted a multiple sclerosis or monophasic outcome. Performance of the 2001, 2010, and 2017 international McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, the 2016 MRI in multiple sclerosis (MAGNIMS) criteria, and our 2011 proposed (Verhey) criteria were determined; performance was adjudicated with generalised linear models.FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2004, and June 30, 2017, we included 324 participants with median follow-up of 72 months (range 6-150), 71 (22%) participants with multiple sclerosis, 237 (73%) with monophasic acquired demyelinating syndrome, 14 (4%) with relapsing non-multiple sclerosis, and two (1%) with alternative diagnoses. We scored 2391 brain, 444 spinal, and 67 dedicated orbital MRI scans. One or more T1 hypointense lesions plus one or more periventricular lesions (Verhey criteria) best predicted multiple sclerosis outcome. Performance of the 2017 McDonald criteria was comparable to the 2010 McDonald criteria and was easier to adjudicate. The ability of CSF oligoclonal bands to substitute for the requirement for both enhancing and non-enhancing lesions in the 2017 McDonald criteria improved its performance compared with the 2010 criteria. Myelin oligodendrocyte testing at baseline did not improve performance of the 2017 McDonald criteria.INTERPRETATION: The 2017 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, as applied at the time of incident attack, perform well in identifying children and youth with multiple sclerosis, indicating that the same diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis apply across the age span. The presence of so-called black holes on MRI and periventricular lesions at baseline (Verhey criteria) also effectively distinguish children with multiple sclerosis from children with monophasic demyelination. The presence of CSF oligoclonal bands improve diagnostic accuracy. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies identify children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and those with relapsing non-multiple sclerosis, most of whom do not meet 2017 McDonald criteria at onset.FUNDING: The Multiple Sclerosis Scientific Research Foundation and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to evaluate the reliability of CL detection on DIR longitudinally at multiple subsequent time-points applying the MAGNIMs scoring criteria for CLs.METHODS: 26 MS patients received a 3T-MRI (Siemens, Skyra) with DIR at 12 time-points (TP) within a 16 months period. Scans were assessed in random order by two different raters. Both raters separately marked all CLs on each scan and total lesion numbers were obtained for each scan-TP and patient. After a retrospective re-evaluation, the number of consensus CLs (conL) was defined as the total number of CLs, which both raters finally agreed on. CLs volumes, relative signal intensities and CLs localizations were determined. Both ratings (conL vs. non-consensus scoring) were compared for further analysis.RESULTS: A total number of n = 334 CLs were identified by both raters in 26 MS patients with a first agreement of both raters on 160 out of 334 of the CLs found (κ = 0.48). After the retrospective re-evaluation, consensus agreement increased to 233 out of 334 CL (κ = 0.69). 93.8% of conL were visible in at least 2 consecutive TP. 74.7% of the conL were visible in all 12 consecutive TP. ConL had greater mean lesion volumes and higher mean signal intensities compared to lesions that were only detected by one of the raters (p<0.05). A higher number of CLs in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobe were identified by both raters than the number of those only identified by one of the raters (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: After a first assessment, slightly less than a half of the CL were considered as reliably detectable on longitudinal DIR images. A retrospective re-evaluation notably increased the consensus agreement. However, this finding is narrowed, considering the fact that retrospective evaluation steps might not be practicable in clinical routine. Lesions that were not reliably identifiable by both raters seem to be characterized by lower signal intensity and smaller size, or located in distinct anatomical brain regions."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "SATB1 is a homeodomain protein and is predominantly expressed in thymocytes.

We aimed to investigate the link between seizure and SLE utilizing a large sample of subjects and extensive data analysis.METHODS: Patients with SLE were compared with age- and sex-matched controls regarding the prevalence of epilepsy in a cross-sectional study. Chi-square and t tests were used for univariate analysis and a logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The study was performed utilizing the medical database of Clalit Health Services.RESULTS: The study included 5,018 patients with SLE and 25,090 age- and gender-frequency-matched controls. The proportion of epilepsy was found significantly higher among SLE patients (4.03 vs. 0.87%, p < 0.001). Using logistic regression, adjusting for multiple confounding factors, older age (≥70 years) resulted as negative predictor (OR 0.42 [95% CI 0.27-0.62], p <0.001), whereas the presence of SLE was a positive predictor of epilepsy (OR 4.70 [95% CI 3.94-5.82], p < 0.001). Interaction between SLE and elderly age resulted in high OR of 5.47 for epilepsy (95% CI 2.53-11.9).CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the higher prevalence of epilepsy in SLE patients. Physicians should be aware of such findings and have a lower threshold for suspecting epileptic seizures in these patients.

While several regions within S have been shown to influence the ability to induce fusion, the region of the protein actually responsible for fusion, the fusion peptide, has not yet been identified. We identified two hydrophobic peptides (peptides #1 and #2) within MHV-A59 S2 as possible fusion domains. This was based on hydrophobicity, conservation among coronavirus S proteins and the prediction of a sided helix conformation. Using site directed mutagenesis and an in vitro cell to cell fusion assay we showed that substitution of hydrophobic amino acids with charged amino acids, within the predicted hydrophobic face of either of these two peptides eliminated fusion. Within peptide #1 substitution of the same hydrophobic amino acids with other hydrophobic amino acids or substitution of polar amino acids with charged or polar amino acids had little effect on fusion. Thus peptides #1 and #2 remain likely candidates for the MHV fusion peptide. A third previously identified peptide within S2 (Chambers et al., 1990) is unlikely as a fusion peptide as it is not well conserved among coronaviruses and substitution within the hydrophobic face with charged amino acids does not effect fusion."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity,", "answer_start": 903}], "question": "What is the function of a viral peplomer?", "id": "5e5bafa01af46fc130000002_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Viral proteins of two strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which have different tissue trophism and serology, were separated on the basis of their isoelectric points (pI).

The viral structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pI and one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain. Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity, it appears that altered pathogenicity of strains of IBV may be detected by alteration of pI of the proteins.

From a US societal perspective, this analysis models the clinical efficacy and estimates the value-based price (VBP) for erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor.METHODS: A Markov health state transition model was developed to estimate the incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and value-based price range for erenumab in migraine prevention. The model comprises \"on preventive treatment\", \"off preventive treatment\", and \"death\" health states across a 10-year time horizon. The evaluation compared erenumab to no preventive treatment in episodic and chronic migraine patients that have failed at least one preventive therapy. Therapeutic benefits are based on estimated changes in monthly migraine days (MMD) from erenumab pivotal clinical trials and a network meta-analysis of migraine studies. Utilities were estimated using previously published mapping algorithms. A VBP analysis was performed to identify maximum erenumab annual prices at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 per QALY. Estimates of VBP under different scenarios such as choice of different comparators, assumptions around inclusion of placebo effect, and exclusion of work productivity losses were also generated.RESULTS: Erenumab resulted in incremental QALYs of 0.185 vs supportive care (SC) and estimated cost offsets due to reduced MMD of $8,482 over 10 years, with an average duration of treatment of 2.01 years. The estimated VBP at WTP thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 for erenumab compared to SC ranged from $14,238-$23,998. VBP estimates including the placebo effect and excluding work productivity ranged from $7,445-$13,809; increasing to $12,151-$18,589 with onabotulinumtoxinA as a comparator in chronic migraine.CONCLUSION: Erenumab is predicted to reduce migraine-related direct and indirect costs, and increase QALYs compared to SC."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are currently under evaluation for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine: eptinezumab (ALD403), fremanezumab (TEV-48125), galcanezumab (LY2951742), and erenumab (AMG334).

This article summarises the results of a review on adverse effects of ITB based on a systematic literature search in scientific medical databases. A meta-analysis was not performed as identified studies displayed major heterogeneity. The search resulted in 14 articles relevant to the topic, reporting mostly on surveys, ecological and intervention studies. Only one study from Poland focused on effects (both desired and adverse) of an ITB intervention following the Chernobyl accident. All other studies reported on iodine administration in a different context. Overall, the studies did not reveal severe adverse reactions to potassium iodide in the general public. Since ITB is a protective measure only applied in very specific circumstances, scientifically sound studies of adverse effects are scarce and consequently the evidence base is weak. The assessment of adverse effects of ITB relies on indirect evidence from related areas.

High doses of potassium iodide are effective to block radioiodine thyroid uptake and to prevent development of thyroid cancer years later. However, there are controversies concerning thyroid cancer risk induced by radioiodine exposure in adults. Further, the interaction of nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake is higher than in healthy people. In case of repeated or continued radioiodine release, more than one dose of potassium iodide may be necessary and be taken up to 1 week. Repeated iodine thyroid blocking obviously is not harmful. Side effects of iodine thyroid blocking should not be overestimated; there is little evidence for adverse effects in adults. Newborns and babies, however, may be more sensitive to side effects. In the rare case of iodine hypersensitivity, potassium perchlorate may be applied as an alternative to iodine for thyroid blocking."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "This article describes the process and methods of developing the revised, evidence-based WHO guidelines for ITB following nuclear and radiological accidents", "answer_start": 205}], "question": "What is iodine thyroid blocking?", "id": "5e5cc1fa1af46fc130000005_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The meeting held in May 2014 in Würzburg, Germany, discussed the scope of the revision of the 1999 WHO guidelines for iodine thyroid blocking (ITB) by following the WHO handbook for guideline development.

The specific pan-Pim kinase inhibitor AZD1208 as well as PIM447 in combination with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 cooperatively downregulated the mTORC1/4EBP1 pathway, formation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex, and Mcl-1 expression leading to activation of Bak and Bax to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis synergistically in these cells. These cooperative effects were enhanced or inhibited by knock down of mTOR or expression of its activated mutant, respectively. Overexpression of Mcl-1 conferred the resistance on 32D/ITD cells to combined inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway and Pim kinases, while the Mcl-1-specific BH3 mimetic A-1210477 conquered the resistance of MV4-11 cells to GDC-0941.

HCC78R cells showed upregulation of HB-EGF and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation and the EGFR signaling pathway. Recombinant HB-EGF or EGF rendered HCC78 cells or ABC-20 cells resistant to crizotinib. RNA sequence analysis by next-generation sequencing revealed the upregulation of AXL in HCC78R cells. HCC78R cells showed marked sensitivity to EGFR-TKI or anti-EGFR antibody treatment in vitro.

Our results showed that saracatinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of ABCB1 substrate drugs in ABCB1 overexpressing HeLa/v200, MCF-7/adr and HEK293/ABCB1 cells, an effect that was stronger than that of gefitinib, whereas it had no effect on the cytotoxicity of the substrates in ABCC1 overexpressing HL-60/adr cells and its parental sensitive cells. Additionally, saracatinib significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation.

Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines, saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells.

Furthermore, the upward trends of increases in a variety of other tumors including breast cancer, cancers of central nervous system and renal cancer have been reported in the persons exposed to Chornobyl fallout.

Several genes and/or proteins controlling apoptosis directly or indirectly have been incorporated into the analysis.

There were no marked differences in the regional distribution of BRCA1 mutations, so that the significant differences in age at diagnosis and family history of breast cancer patients from areas afflicted by the Chernobyl accident could not be explained by BRCA1. We next observed a higher impact and a shifted mutational spectrum of BRCA1 in the series of Byelorussian ovarian cancer patients where the three founder mutations accounted for 26.4% (53/201). While the Cys61Gly mutation appeared underrepresented in ovarian cancer as compared with breast cancer cases from the same population (p = 0.01), the 4153delA mutation made a higher contribution to ovarian cancer than to breast cancer (p < 0.01). BRCA1 mutations were significantly enriched among ovarian cancer cases with a first-degree family history of breast or ovarian cancer, whereas the median age at ovarian cancer diagnosis was not different between mutation carriers and non-carriers.

Irradiated cells also show genomic instability, as do adjacent non-irradiated cells (the bystander effect); the importance to carcinogenesis remains to be established.

In contrast, millions of people were exposed to radioactive isotopes in the fallout from the Chernobyl accident, within the first 20 years there was a large increase in thyroid carcinoma incidence and a possible radiation-related increase in breast cancer, but as yet there is no general increase in malignancies. The increase in thyroid carcinoma, attributable to the very large amounts of iodine 131 released, was first noticed in children with a strong relationship between young age at exposure and risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The extent of the increase, the reasons for the relationship to age at exposure, the reduction in attributable fraction with increasing latency and the role of environmental factors are discussed. The large number of radiation-induced PTCs has allowed new observations. The subtype and molecular findings change with latency; most early cases were solid PTCs with RET-PTC3 rearrangements, later cases were classical PTCs with RET-PTC1 rearrangements. Small numbers of many other RET rearrangements have occurred in 'Chernobyl' PTCs, and also rearrangement of BRAF. Five of the N-terminal genes found in papillary carcinoma rearrangements are also involved in rearrangements in hematological malignancies; three are putative tumor suppressor genes, and two are further genes fused to RET in PTCs. Radiation causes double-strand breaks; the rearrangements common in these radiation-induced tumors reflect their etiology. It is suggested that oncogenic rearrangements may commonly involve both a tumor-suppressor gene (or a DNA repair gene) as well as an oncogene. Involvement of two relevant genes would give a greater chance of progression and a shorter latency than a single-gene mutation. More information is needed on germline mutations conferring susceptibility to radiation-induced PTCs, particularly DNA repair genes. The radiation exposure to the fallout after Chernobyl was very different from the whole body radiation after the atomic bombs.

TRF1 tethers SA1 within telomeric regions that SA1 transiently interacts with. SA1 and TRF1 together form longer DNA-DNA pairing tracts than with TRF1 alone, as revealed by atomic force microscopy imaging. These results suggest that at telomeres cohesion relies on the molecular interplay between TRF1 and SA1 to promote DNA-DNA pairing, while along chromosomal arms the core cohesin assembly might also depend on SA1 1D diffusion on DNA and sequence-specific DNA binding."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer cells on its paralog STAG1", "answer_start": 385}], "question": "What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?", "id": "5d35dfbdb3a638076300000b_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene expression.

Whereas Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3, the primary mediators of Shh signaling, were all expressed in hippocampal neural progenitors, Shh treatment of NSCs induced only Gli1 expression. Acute depletion of Gli1 in postnatal NSCs by short-hairpin RNA decreased proliferation, whereas germline deletion of Gli1 did not affect NSC proliferation, suggesting a difference in mechanisms of Gli1 compensation that may be developmentally dependent. To determine whether Gli1 was sufficient to enhance NSC proliferation, we overexpressed this mitogen and were surprised to find that Gli1 resulted in decreased proliferation, accumulation of NSCs in the G2/M phase of cell cycle, and apoptosis. In contrast, Gli1-expressing lineage-restricted neural precursors demonstrated a 4.5-fold proliferation enhancement. Expression analyses of Gli1-expressing NSCs identified significant induction of Gadd45a and decreased cyclin A2 and Stag1 mRNA, genes involved in the G2-M transition and apoptosis. Furthermore, Gadd45a overexpression was sufficient to partially recapitulate the Gli1-induced G2/M accumulation and cell death of NSCs. In contrast to normal stem cells, tumor-derived stem cells had markedly higher basal Gli1 expression and did not undergo apoptosis with further elevation of Gli1. Our data suggest that Gli1-induced apoptosis may serve as a protective mechanism against premature mitosis and may give insight into mechanisms by which nonmalignant stem cells restrain hyperproliferation in the context of potentially transforming mitogenic signals.

Upon ESC differentiation, most of these binding sites disappear and instead new CTCF independent RAD21 binding sites emerge, which are enriched for binding sites of transcription factors implicated in early differentiation.

HL survivors have two- to fourfold increased risks to develop SMNs and CVD compared with the general population. With respect to SMNs, radiotherapy is associated with 1.5- to 15-fold increased risk of solid malignancies.

The RR of solid SMNs increases strongly with younger age at first treatment. Risks of lung, breast, and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers increase with higher radiation dose. Alkylating agent chemotherapy, especially procarbazine, does not only increase risk of leukemia but also of solid malignancies, in particular, cancers of the lung and GI tract. In contrast, gonadotoxic chemotherapy decreases the risk of radiation-associated breast cancer, through induction of premature menopause. Smoking appears to multiply the radiation- and chemotherapy-associated risks of lung cancer. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for HL may cause cardiovascular toxicity. Radiotherapy increases the risk of coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure (HF), and pericarditis, whereas anthracycline-containing chemotherapy increases the risks of HF and valvular heart disease.

We developed a Markov decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model to estimate the merits of annual LDCT screening among HL survivors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Population databases and HL-specific literature informed key model parameters, including lung cancer rates and stage distribution, cause-specific survival estimates, and utilities. Relative risks accounted for radiation therapy (RT) technique, smoking status (>10 pack-years or current smokers vs not), age at HL diagnosis, time from HL treatment, and excess radiation from LDCTs. LDCT assumptions, including expected stage-shift, false-positive rates, and likely additional workup were derived from the National Lung Screening Trial and preliminary results from an internal phase 2 protocol that performed annual LDCTs in 53 HL survivors. We assumed a 3% discount rate and a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).RESULTS: Annual LDCT screening was cost effective for all smokers. A male smoker treated with mantle RT at age 25 achieved maximum QALYs by initiating screening 12 years post-HL, with a life expectancy benefit of 2.1 months and an incremental cost of $34,841/QALY. Among nonsmokers, annual screening produced a QALY benefit in some cases, but the incremental cost was not below the WTP threshold for any patient subsets. As age at HL diagnosis increased, earlier initiation of screening improved outcomes. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the model was most sensitive to the lung cancer incidence and mortality rates and expected stage-shift from screening.CONCLUSIONS: HL survivors are an important high-risk population that may benefit from screening, especially those treated in the past with large radiation fields including mantle or involved-field RT. Screening may be cost effective for all smokers but possibly not for nonsmokers despite a small life expectancy benefit.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Despite their utility, balancer chromosomes are rarely used in mice because they are difficult to generate using conventional methods. Here we describe the engineering of a mouse balancer chromosome with the Cre-loxP recombination system. The chromosome features a 24-centiMorgan (cM) inversion between Trp53 (also known as p53) and Wnt3 on mouse chromosome 11 that is recessive lethal and dominantly marked with a K14-Agouti transgene. When allelic to a wild-type chromosome, the inversion suppresses crossing over in the inversion interval, accompanied by elevated recombination in the flanking regions. The inversion functions as a balancer chromosome because it can be used to maintain a lethal mutation in the inversion interval as a self-sustaining trans-heterozygous stock. This strategy can be used to generate similar genetic reagents throughout the mouse genome.

(For S1-3 see also: Bell, 1954; Sandler, 1972; Cline, 1976). These five distinct effects were initially quantified from estimates of viability in single generation crossing experiments. Dynamic estimates of these fitness parameters were obtained by fitting the elimination rate of da from a series of large random mating cage populations to a recurrence equation by the method of minimum chi-square. The stability of these estimates discerns those effects which are truly pleiotropic versus those due to linked genes. The dynamic estimates supported only S1 and S4 effects. Evidence for S2 and S5 was indeterminate, but the S3 effect was rejected (P less than 0.01). The observed reduction in fitness, supposedly due to this recessive zygotic effect for da, was most likely the result of linked deleterious genes. These results indicate that pleiotropic vital effects observed in single generation test-cross matings may be caused by linked genes rather than the specific mutant per se. This problem is of particular importance when the mutant allele has been maintained with a balancer chromosome. Experiments on the rescue of daughters from da/da mothers with low temperatures during embryogenesis and with dechorionation of eggs were described in which the findings failed to confirm previously reported actions of the da gene.

We used the approach of chromosome extraction, which has both advantages and disadvantages compared to classical techniques, to test the model further. From four isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster, four sets of recombinant extracted lines were constructed using standard balancer-chromosome techniques. The four parental lines and 53 recombinants were reared under controlled laboratory conditions and isolated as pairs for scoring daily fecundity and longevity. Even though the design is not optimal for estimating classical components of genetic variance, it afforded a uniquely direct test of the magnitude of environmental covariances, while giving a detailed genetic picture of part of the genome. There were clear differences among the recombinant series in the distribution of mean longevity and early fecundity. The genetic correlation between early fecundity (sum of egg production for the first five days posteclosion) and female longevity was significantly negative in only one of the recombinant series. When all lines were considered together, the phenotypic correlation between these traits was significantly negative (P < 0.02), while the broad-sense genetic correlation was -0.219 (P < 0.11).

Our primary objective was to investigate the effect of EBRT and RP on the second primary BCa and RCa incidence.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Multivariable competing-risk regression analyses were performed to assess the risk of developing a second primary BCa or RCa.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of the 84397 individuals included in the study, 33252 (39%) were treated with RP and 51145 (61%) with EBRT. Median follow-up was 69 months, and follow-up periods for patients who did not develop BCa, RCa, or pelvic cancer were 68, 69, and 68 mo, respectively. A total of 1660 individuals developed pelvic tumors (1236 BCa and 432 RCa). The 5- and 10-yr cumulative BCa incidence rates were 0.75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64-0.85%) and 1.63% (95% CI: 1.45-1.80%) versus 1.26% (95% CI: 1.15-1.37%) and 2.34% (95% CI: 2.16-2.53%) for patients treated with RP versus EBRT, respectively. The 5- and 10-yr cumulative RCa incidence rates were 0.32% (95% CI: 0.25-0.39%) and 0.73% (95% CI: 0.61-0.85%) versus 0.36% (95% CI: 0.30-0.41%) and 0.69% (95% CI: 0.60-0.79%) for patients treated with RP versus EBRT, respectively.

All patients were homogeneously treated using an intraoperative dynamic planning prostate brachytherapy technique, with loose 125-iodine seeds and a prescription dose of 145Gy. The mean follow-up was 132 months.RESULTS: The 10-year overall survival for the entire cohort was 92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90-94). The 10-year relapse-free survival rate was 82% (95% CI: 79-85). Overall, 61 second cancers were registered. When comparing with a matched general French population, the standard incidence ratio (SIR) for bladder cancer was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.46-1.93). For colorectal cancer, the SIR was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.19-0.89). For lung cancer, the SIR was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.17-0.76). The SIR for all cancers was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47-0.79).

We accessed the population-based databases of Manitoba Health (single provincial health insurer) to get age-, gender-, and geography-matched non-IBD controls (n = 310). We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure serum antibodies.RESULTS: Seropositivity for measles and mumps was similar in controls (98.1%, 78.4%, respectively) as in CD (96.2%, 72.3% respectively) and in UC (95.5%, 74.6%, respectively). However, controls were significantly more likely to be seropositive for rubella (98.1%) than were CD cases (91.0%, P < 0.0002) or UC cases (93.3%, P = 0.01). Males accounted for the significantly lower rates of seropositivity to rubella with CD. While we determined that significantly more controls than CD were vaccinated, we cannot be sure if the increased rate of rubella seropositivity in controls is secondary to wildtype or vaccine-associated infection.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest there is no association of having acquired measles, mumps, or rubella (by natural infection or through vaccination) and CD or UC.

Typically, the disease is characterized by a two-phase course. After an average incubation period of 8 to 11 days, initial symptoms such as fever, cough, coryza and conjunctivitis appear. Two thirds of the patients shows a white-marked enanthema on the buccal mucosa (Koplik's spots). After disappearance of these symptoms, a second increase of temperature and the typical measles exanthema, a brownish-red maculopapular rash, appear. Infection with measles virus induces transient immunodeficiency that favours the formation of several complications. Some of them, e. g. encephalitic diseases, are severe and associated with a high mortality. Measles are world-wide distributed and belong to the ten most frequent infectious diseases in some less developed countries. The disease is associated with a high mortality in some African and South-East Asian countries, in particular in children aged less than 12 months. Of particular note, measles are the most important cause of blindness in children in population with borderline vitamin A status. In Germany, the number of reported measles cases has been declined dramatically since the introduction of a vaccine more than four decades ago. However, regional outbreaks or small epidemics still occur. Because there is no specific antiviral treatment, therapy of measles is symptomatic and depends on the manifestation of the disease. The most important prevention strategy is immunization with a life-attenuated vaccine that can be applied as monovaccination or in combination with mumps and rubella virus (MMR vaccination) or mumps, rubella and varicella virus (MMRV vaccination)."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Mumps is a Paramyxoviridae virus.

This disease was rampant prior to introduction of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, resulting in decreased incidence. This disease has demonstrated several outbreaks.OBJECTIVE: This review provides a focused evaluation of mumps, an update on outbreaks, management recommendations, and ways to decrease transmission.DISCUSSION: Clusters of mumps outbreaks continue to occur. The virus is a paramyxovirus, a single-stranded RNA virus. The vaccine can provide lifelong immunity if administered properly, though prior to 1967 and introduction of the vaccine, the virus was common. In the past decade, there have been several notable outbreaks. Humans are the only known hosts, with disease spread through exposure to droplets and saliva. Factors affecting transmission include age, compromised immunity, time of year, travel, and vaccination status. Upper respiratory symptoms, fever, and headache are common, with unilateral or bilateral parotitis, and the virus may spread to other systems. Diagnosis is clinical, though polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin testing are available. This review provides several recommendations for vaccine in pregnancy, patients living in close quarters, health care personnel, and those immunocompromised. Treatment is generally supportive, with emphasis on proper isolation to prevent widespread outbreaks. Although reporting regulations and procedures vary by state, mumps is reportable in most states.CONCLUSIONS: Mumps is an easily spread virus. Although vaccination is the most effective way to prevent transmission, early recognition of the disease is crucial.

Genetic factors play a central role in the pathogenesis of PDB but environmental factors also contribute. Measles virus (MV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) have all been implicated as potential disease triggers but the data are conflicting. Since chronic paramyxovirus infection with measles is known to be accompanied by increased production of antiviral antibodies, we have analysed circulating concentrations of antibodies to MV, CDV, and RSV as well as mumps, rubella and varicella zoster virus (VZV) in 463 patients with PDB and 220 aged and gender-matched controls. We also studied the relation between viral antibody concentrations and various markers of disease severity and extent in 460 PDB patients. A high proportion of cases and controls tested positive for antiviral antibodies but there was no significant difference in circulating antibody concentrations between PDB cases and controls for MV, CDV, RSV, rubella or VZV. However, mumps virus antibody levels were significantly higher in the PDB cases (mean ± SD = 3.1 ± 0.84 vs. 2.62 ± 0.86. p < 0.001). There was no association between disease severity and circulating antibody concentrations to any of the viruses. In conclusion, we found no evidence to suggest that PDB is associated with abnormalities of immune response to measles or other paramyxoviruses, although there was evidence of a greater antibody response to mumps.

Olaparib is a PARPi approved for the treatment of BRCA mutant ovarian and breast carcinoma. Emerging clinical data suggest a benefit of combining olaparib with immunotherapy in prostate cancer patients both with and without somatic BRCA mutations.METHODS: We examined if olaparib, when combined with IgG1 antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cetuximab (anti-EGFR), or avelumab (anti-PD-L1), would increase tumor cell sensitivity to killing by natural killer (NK) cells independently of BRCA status or mAb target upregulation. BRCA mutant and BRCA wildtype (WT) prostate carcinoma cell lines were pretreated with olaparib and then exposed to NK cells in the presence or absence of cetuximab or avelumab.RESULTS: NK-mediated killing was significantly increased in both cell lines and was further increased using the ADCC-mediating mAbs. Pre-exposure of NK cells to recombinant IL-15/IL-15Rα further increased the lysis of olaparib treated tumor cells. In addition, olaparib treated tumor cells were killed to a significantly greater degree by engineered high-affinity NK cells (haNK). We show here for the first time that (a) olaparib significantly increased tumor cell sensitivity to NK killing and ADCC in both BRCA WT and BRCA mutant prostate carcinoma cells, independent of PD-L1 or EGFR modulation; (b) mechanistically, treatment with olaparib upregulated death receptor TRAIL-R2; and (c) olaparib significantly enhanced NK killing of additional tumor types, including breast, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and chordoma.CONCLUSIONS: These studies support the combined use of NK- and ADCC-mediating agents with correctly timed PARP inhibition."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "PARP inhibition with olaparib, warrants further investigation,", "answer_start": 1409}], "question": "What is drug target for olaparib?", "id": "5e42d1a748dab47f26000010_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The poor prognosis for patients with esophagogastric cancers (EGC) has resulted in an increased focus on the use of targeted agents in this disease.

We have used an enhancer trap to determine whether other glucocorticoid-regulated genes exist in AtT-20 cells. An enhancer trap is a recombinant construction containing a selectable marker driven by a promoter that has been weakened by removal of its enhancers so that the transfected trap is only expressed if it comes under the influence of an endogenous enhancer. For a selectable marker, we used a fusion gene coding for hygromycin phosphotransferase (Hy) and herpes simplex thymidine kinase. Thus, expression of this gene conferred hygromycin resistance and ganciclovir sensitivity. Suppression resulted in ganciclovir resistance and hygromycin sensitivity. An enhancerless promoter was produced using a truncated, transcriptionally inactive, form of the POMC promoter. AtT-20/D1 cells were transfected with this construct and cultured in medium containing hygromycin to kill any cells not expressing the Hy gene. The survivors were cultured in medium containing ganciclovir and dexamethasone and cloned. Clones in which the transgene was down-regulated by dexamethasone survived and were designated AtT-20/NET (for negative enhancer trap). Northern blot analysis confirmed that the transgene was down-regulated by dexamethasone as expected and that in at least one instance, suppression of the transgene was more complete than suppression of the full-length POMC promoter. Southern blot analysis after restriction enzyme digestion showed that each cell clone contained a single copy of the transgene, and PCR analysis of the promoter region showed that insertion had occurred in two unique sites in at least two cell clones. Another plasmid construct was prepared that contained the selectable gene but lacked any promoter elements. After transfection of AtT-20 cells with this vector, up-regulated enhancers were trapped by selection in hygromycin and dexamethasone followed by ganciclovir alone and designated AtT-20/PET cells (for positive enhancer trap). Up-regulation of the selectable gene in AtT-20/PET cells was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of dexamethasone-treated cells. In summary, glucocorticoid-regulated enhancers have been identified in AtT-20/D1 cells by an enhancer trap strategy that uses sequential selection under conditions that test whether the transgene is active. These results indicate that in addition to the well characterized, down-regulated POMC gene, there are other glucocorticoid-regulated genes in AtT-20/D1 cells that are both up-regulated and down-regulated by glucocorticoids."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The E1a gene of adenovirus encodes two proteins, 289 and 243 amino acids long, which have positive (transactivator) and negative (enhancer repressor) RNA polymerase II transcriptional regulatory properties and cell transformation activities including cooperation with an activated ras gene.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Are there negative enhancers?", "id": "5d35eb01b3a638076300000f_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The E1a gene of adenovirus encodes two proteins, 289 and 243 amino acids long, which have positive (transactivator) and negative (enhancer repressor) RNA polymerase II transcriptional regulatory properties and cell transformation activities including cooperation with an activated ras gene.

To understand whether the transcriptional regulatory activities of E1a are related to its ras cooperation activity, we generated a series of mutant E1a expression vectors by linker insertion mutagenesis of the 289-amino-acid protein. Here we describe a new class of mutants which although defective for enhancer repression still can cooperate with the ras oncogene in cell transformation. The mutants are also defective in transcription transactivation. Our data suggest that enhancer repression and transformation via ras cooperation are separate E1a functions and that cooperation with ras does not rely on either of the RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory functions of E1a.

We found that pFUS enhanced MSC homing at 1 day post-cisplatin, prior to renal functional deficits, and that enhanced homing improved outcomes of renal function, tubular cell death, and regeneration at 5 days post-cisplatin compared to MSC alone. We then investigated whether pFUS+MSC therapy could rescue established AKI. MSC alone at 3 days post-cisplatin, after renal functional deficits were obvious, significantly improved 7-day survival of animals. Survival was further improved by pFUS and MSC. pFUS prior to MSC injections increased IL-10 production by MSC that homed to kidneys and generated an anti-inflammatory immune cell profile in treated kidneys. This study shows pFUS is a neoadjuvant approach to improve MSC homing to diseased organs. pFUS with MSC better prevents AKI than MSC alone and allows rescue therapy in established AKI, which currently has no meaningful therapeutic options."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Conclusion: Selumetinib has promising antitumor activity in children with LGG.", "answer_start": 1651}], "question": "Is Selumetinib effective for low-grade glioma?", "id": "5e44bdba48dab47f2600001c_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Background: Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is important for growth of pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs). The aim of this study was to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib in children with progressive LGG.Methods: Selumetinib was administered orally starting at 33 mg/m2/dose b.i.d., using the modified continual reassessment method. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed during the first course. BRAF aberrations in tumor tissue were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization.Results: Thirty-eight eligible subjects were enrolled. Dose levels 1 and 2 (33 and 43 mg/m2/dose b.i.d.) were excessively toxic. DLTs included grade 3 elevated amylase/lipase (n = 1), headache (n = 1), mucositis (n = 2), and grades 2-3 rash (n = 6). At dose level 0 (25 mg/m2/dose b.i.d, the RP2D), only 3 of 24 subjects experienced DLTs (elevated amylase/lipase, rash, and mucositis). At the R2PD, the median (range) area under the curve (AUC0-∞) and apparent oral clearance of selumetinib were 3855 ng*h/mL (1780 to 7250 ng × h/mL) and 6.5 L × h-1 × m-2 (3.4 to 14.0 L × h-1 × m-2), respectively. Thirteen of 19 tumors had BRAF abnormalities. Among the 5 (20%) of 25 subjects with sustained partial responses, all at the RP2D, 4 had BRAF aberrations, 1 had insufficient tissue. Subjects received a median of 13 cycles (range: 1-26). Fourteen (37%) completed all protocol treatment (26 cycles [n = 13], 13 cycles [n = 1]) with at least stable disease; 2-year progression-free survival at the RP2D was 69 ± SE 9.8%.Conclusion: Selumetinib has promising antitumor activity in children with LGG.

In part 2, men received placebo or 20, 60, or 180 mg each day for 10 days. In part 3, women received placebo or 20, 60, or 180 mg each day for 21 days, where dosing was initiated on day 3 ± 2 after menses.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics on circulating levels of LH, FSH, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone, in addition to physiological biomarkers of endometrial thickening, follicle growth, and the duration of the menstrual cycle were evaluated.RESULTS: ESN364 was well-tolerated and rapidly bioavailable with linear pharmacokinetics and no drug accumulation with repeated, daily oral administration. Drug treatment dose-dependently decreased basal LH, but not FSH, and consequently decreased estradiol and progesterone (in women) as well as testosterone (in men). The hormonal changes in women corresponded to delayed ovulation, decreased endometrial thickening, impeded follicular maturation, and prolongation of the menstrual cycle. Drug effects were rapidly reversible.CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of the NK3R antagonist, ESN364, suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in healthy volunteers by selective modulation of gonadotropin secretion, leading to a restrained decrease in ovarian hormone levels in women.

TLR2 is also a key regulator of mucosal immunity implicated in the development of allergic disease. TLR2 activators are found in many common foods, but the role of TLR2 in oral tolerance and allergic sensitization to foods is not well understood.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts of TLR2 expression and TLR2 activation on oral tolerance to food antigens in a murine model.METHODS: Mice were fed ovalbumin (OVA) or peanut butter with or without the addition of low doses of TLR2 activators Pam3 CSK4 or FSL-1. Oral tolerance was assessed by analysing antibody responses after a systemic antigen challenge. OVA-specific Tregs were assessed in the Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen in wild-type and TLR2(-/-) mice. Low-dose Pam3 CSK4 was also tested as an oral adjuvant.RESULTS: Oral tolerance was successfully induced in both wild-type and TLR2(-/-) recipient mice, with an associated regulatory T-cell response. Oral TLR2 activation, with low-dose Pam3 CSK4 or FSL-1, during oral antigen exposure was found to alter oral tolerance and was associated with the development of substantial IgE and IgA responses to foods upon systemic challenge. Low-dose oral Pam3 CSK4 treatment also selectively enhanced antigen-specific IgA responses to oral antigen exposure.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: TLR2 is not necessary for oral tolerance induction, but oral TLR2 activation modulates humoral IgE and IgA responses during tolerance development. Low-dose Pam3 CSK4 is also an effective oral adjuvant that selectively enhances IgA production. These observations are pertinent to the optimization of oral allergen immunotherapy and oral vaccine development.© 2015 The Authors.

During differentiation, binding of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (K27me3), is lost on developmental genes that are transcriptionally induced. We observed a global decrease in K27me3 in as little as 3 days after differentiation of mouse ES cells induced by retinoic acid (RA) treatment. The global levels of the histone K27 methyltransferase EZH2 also decreased with RA treatment. A loss of EZH2 binding and K27me3 was observed locally on PRC2 target genes induced after 3 days of RA, including Nestin. In contrast, direct RA-responsive genes that are rapidly induced, such as Hoxa1, showed a loss of EZH2 binding and K27me3 after only a few hours of RA treatment. Following differentiation induced by leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) withdrawal without RA, Hoxa1 was not transcriptionally activated. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of EZH2 resulted in loss of K27me3 during LIF withdrawal, but the Hoxa1 gene remained transcriptionally silent after loss of this repressive mark. Induction of histone hyperacetylation overrode the repressive K27me3 modification and resulted in Hoxa1 gene expression. Together, these data show that there are multiple temporal phases of derepression of PRC2 target genes during ES cell differentiation and that other epigenetic marks (specifically, increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4), in addition to derepression, are important for gene-specific transcriptional activation.

In particular, we address the contribution of histone epigenetic marks and histone modifiers on the silencing of the Runx2/p57 bone-related isoform in rat hippocampal tissues at embryonic to adult stages. Our results indicate enrichment of repressive chromatin histone marks and of the Polycomb PRC2 complex at the Runx2/p57 promoter region. Knockdown of PRC2 H3K27-methyltransferases Ezh2 and Ezh1, or forced expression of the Trithorax/COMPASS subunit Wdr5 activates Runx2/p57 mRNA expression in both immature and mature hippocampal cells.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3 levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer cells.

Here we examine the effect loss of either PRC2 or DNA methyltransferase activity has on the placement of the reciprocal mark in mouse ES cells. We find that DNAme is acting globally to antagonize the placement of H3K27me3, in accordance with recently published results. At least 471,011 domains in the mouse genome acquire H3K27me3 when DNAme is diminished. Of these 466,563 have been shown to be fully methylated in wildtype ES cells, indicating the effects of DNAme on H3K27me3 are direct. In a reciprocal experiment, we examine the effect loss of PRC2 has on the placement of DNAme. In contrast to the global antagonism DNAme has on the placement of H3K27me3, loss of H3K27me3 has a modest effect on DNAme, with only 4% of genes undergoing changes in DNAme, including 861 showing increases and 552 showing losses of overall DNAme.

Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27, which establishes H3K27me3 repressive epigenetic marks that promote tissue-specific differentiation by silencing ectopic gene programs.OBJECTIVE: We studied the function of PRC2 in murine heart development using a tissue-restricted conditional inactivation strategy.METHODS AND RESULTS: Inactivation of the PRC2 subunit Ezh2 by Nkx2-5(Cre) (Ezh2(NK)) caused lethal congenital heart malformations, namely, compact myocardial hypoplasia, hypertrabeculation, and ventricular septal defect. Candidate and genome-wide RNA expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of Ezh2(NK) heart identified genes directly repressed by EZH2. Among these were the potent cell cycle inhibitors Ink4a/b (inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 A and B), the upregulation of which was associated with decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation in Ezh2(NK). EZH2-repressed genes were enriched for transcriptional regulators of noncardiomyocyte expression programs such as Pax6, Isl1, and Six1. EZH2 was also required for proper spatiotemporal regulation of cardiac gene expression, because Hcn4, Mlc2a, and Bmp10 were inappropriately upregulated in ventricular RNA. PRC2 was also required later in heart development, as indicated by cardiomyocyte-restricted TNT-Cre inactivation of the PRC2 subunit Eed. However, Ezh2 inactivation by TNT-Cre did not cause an overt phenotype, likely because of functional redundancy with Ezh1. Thus, early Ezh2 inactivation by Nk2-5(Cre) caused later disruption of cardiomyocyte gene expression and heart development.CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a previously undescribed role of EZH2 in regulating heart formation and shows that perturbation of the epigenetic landscape early in cardiogenesis has sustained disruptive effects at later developmental stages."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We found that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me2/me3), binds to its own site of methylation.", "answer_start": 743}], "question": "Which epigenetic mark is deposited by PRC2?", "id": "5d35ef017bc3fee31f000001_008", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Maintenance of gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA- and histone-methylation is essential for preserving cellular identity and function. Multiplication of eukaryotic cells requires that the DNA content of the cell is duplicated through replication, which is coupled to incorporation of de novo synthesized core histones into nucleosomal structures. One of the challenging questions in biology is to explain how the organism ensures that regulatory epigenetic marks, once established, are transferred from one cell generation to the next. Based on studies in our laboratory, we have recently proposed a model for how the methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) can be stably transmitted through the cell division cycle. We found that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me2/me3), binds to its own site of methylation. Moreover, our results suggested that maintenance of transcriptional repression by PRC2 requires the binding of the PRC2 complex to H3K27me3/me2. Based on these two key observations we propose that PRC2 is able to copy the mark from an old parental H3 molecule to a newly synthesized H3 molecule as DNA replication proceeds. In addition, our results support a model for how the H3K27me3 mark could be preserved in the interphase of the cell cycle, where other events such as histone exchange and demethylation could counteract PRC2 function.

Using a heterologous reporter system, we show that transient recruitment of the PRC2 complex to chromatin, upstream of the transcriptional start site, is sufficient to maintain repression through endogenous PRC2 during subsequent cell divisions. Thus, we suggest that once the H3K27me3 is established, it recruits the PRC2 complex to maintain the mark at sites of DNA replication, leading to methylation of H3K27 on the daughter strands during incorporation of newly synthesized histones.

The Rollover Protocol (ROP) Study was conducted to report safety data for patients with HER2-positive locally advanced/metastatic breast and gastric/GEJ cancer who have received long-term H therapy (≥ 5 years and ≥ 3 years for breast and gastric/GEJ cancer, respectively).METHODS: The ROP Study was a single-arm, multicenter, international continuation trial of H in patients who had previously completed a global Roche-sponsored trial with H therapy, had stable disease, and were receiving H at the end of the lead-in trial. Patients with chronic heart failure during the lead-in trial could be included following a risk-benefit analysis. The primary objectives were to provide H therapy to patients with HER2-overexpressing locally advanced/metastatic breast or gastric/GEJ cancer at the end of the lead-in study, and to follow the long-term outcomes and long-term overall safety in these patients.RESULTS: Twenty-five of 69 patients enrolled in the ROP Study received long-term H therapy (19 breast cancer and 6 gastric/GEJ cancer). The median duration of H treatment for patients with breast cancer was 8 years 7 months, and 5 years 2 months for patients with gastric/GEJ cancer.

In addition, MEDLINE and EMBASE online searches for the terms \"neuroprotection\" (and its variants), \"neuroprotective agent\", for all individual drugs and drug classes included in the review, hand searches of conference proceedings from European, International, American Heart Association and Princeton conferences on Stroke, American Neurological Association and American Academy of Neurology meetings from 1992-2001, and direct contact with individual investigators and pharmaceutical companies.SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials were included if they were randomised, controlled studies giving agents with pharmacological properties that included modification of release of EAAs, or blockade of EAA receptors, in stroke within 24h of onset. Efficacy analysis was restricted to trials with a parallel group design: dose escalation studies were excluded. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed on all data.

Seven trials did not report disability data, which were available for 29 trials involving 10,802 subjects.

Trends for increased mortality with three NMDA antagonists were seen - selfotel (OR 1.19 [0.81-1.74]), aptiganel (OR 1.32 [0.91-1.93]) and gavestinel (OR 1.12 [0.95-1.32]) - but this did not achieve significance for the NMDA antagonists considered as a class (1.09 [0.96-1.23]). Aptiganel was also associated with a trend towards worse functional outcome (OR 1.20 [0.88-1.65]) although this was not the case for either of the other two compounds. No statistically significant detriment of psychotomimetic NMDA antagonists was found, although a trend towards higher mortality in this sub-group was seen (OR 1.25 [0.96-1.64]).REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of significant benefit or harm from drugs modulating excitatory amino acid action. Reductio]).REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of significant benefit or harm from drugs modulating excitatory amino acid action. Reduction of death or dependence by 8% or more has been excluded for gavestinel and lubeluzole, which contribute most of the data for this review. However, mechanistic understanding of neuroprotection is too poor to extrapolate from these two failed development plans to all glutamate modulators. Further clinical trials of neuroprotective agents remain justified, since confidence limits around estimates of effect remain wide for most agents, and cannot reliably exclude benefit. Although numbers of patients are too small to confirm or refute a trend towards increased mortality with some NMDA antagonists, further commercial development of these agents is exceedingly unlikely."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "No improvement in clinical outcome of stroke has been seen with competitive NMDA antagonists (selfotel) and non-competitive NMDA antagonists (dextrorphan, GV150526, aptiganel and eliprodil).", "answer_start": 418}], "question": "Is Aptiganel effective for treatment of stroke?", "id": "5e44c76f48dab47f26000022_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "During cerebral ischaemia, glutamate is released in supraphysiological amounts and is toxic to brain tissue. This excitotoxicity is mediated by several glutamate receptor subtypes, including the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Clinical trials of drugs that block the NMDA receptor in acute ischaemic stroke have been disappointing. No improvement in clinical outcome of stroke has been seen with competitive NMDA antagonists (selfotel) and non-competitive NMDA antagonists (dextrorphan, GV150526, aptiganel and eliprodil). The AMPA receptor differs in important ways from the NMDA receptor. It is the principal mediator of fast excitatory neurotransmission. This ligand-gated cation channel is primarily permeable to sodium rather than calcium. It is found in grey and white matter. It is expressed by oligodendrocytes. This distribution may provide neuroprotection for both grey and white matter. In a variety of animal models, reduction in infarct volume with AMPA blockade has been demonstrated. AMPA antagonists also show benefit in spinal cord ischaemia and trauma. The clinical development of safe and effective AMPA blockers has been hampered by poor water solubility and associated renal toxicity.

Continuous EGFR inhibition of first-generation resistant tumors by sequential treatment with afatinib plus/minus cetuximab, followed by osimertinib, represented an effective therapeutic strategy in this model. Whereas T790M resistance mutation was not detected, a major mechanism of acquired resistance was the activation of components of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. This phenomenon was accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Cell lines established in vitro from gefitinib-, or afatinib- or osimertinib-resistant tumors showed metastatic properties and maintained EGFR-TKIs resistance in vitro, that was reverted by the combined blockade of Hh, with the selective SMO inhibitor sonidegib, and EGFR.CONCLUSIONS: EGFR-mutant NSCLC can benefit from continuous treatment with EGFR-inhibitors, indepenently from mechanisms of resistance. In a complex and heterogenous scenario, Hh showed an important role in mediating resistance to EGFR-inhibitors through the induction of mesenchymal properties."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Dual targeting of EGFR using one monoclonal antibody (mAb; cetuximab or panitumumab) and one tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI; gefitinib or erlotinib) is a potential therapeutic approach.

We investigated the effect of these therapies in EGFR-expressing TNBC cell lines that do or do not harbor the main activating mutations of EGFR pathways. Cell lines were sensitive to EGFR-TKIs, whereas mAbs were active only in MDA-MB-468 (EGFR amplification) and SUM-1315 (KRAS and PTEN wild-type) cells. MDA-MB-231 (KRAS mutated) and HCC-1937 (PTEN deletion) cells were resistant to mAbs. The combined treatment resulted in a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and superior inhibition of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in mAb-sensitive cells. The anti-proliferative effect was associated with G1 cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Sensitivity to therapies was characterized by induction of positive regulators and inactivation of negative regulators of cell cycle. These results suggest that dual EGFR inhibition might result in an enhanced antitumor effect in a subgroup of TNBC. The status of EGFR, KRAS and PTEN could be used as a molecular marker for predicting the response to this therapeutic strategy."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Lubeluzole showed promising neuroprotective effects in animal stroke models, but failed to show benefits in acute ischemic stroke in humans.

Two benzothiazolamines, riluzole and lubeluzole, are known blockers of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels. Riluzole is clinically used as a neuroprotectant in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Inhibition of Nav channels by riluzole is voltage-dependent due to preferential binding to inactivated sodium channels. Yet the drug exerts little use-dependent block, probably because it lacks protonable amine. One important property is riluzole ability to inhibit persistent Na+ currents, which likely contributes to its neuroprotective activity. Lubeluzole showed promising neuroprotective effects in animal stroke models, but failed to show benefits in acute ischemic stroke in humans. One important concern is its propensity to prolong the cardiac QT interval, due to hERG K+ channel block. Lubeluzole very potently inhibits Nav channels in a voltage- and use-dependent manner, due to its great preferential affinity for inactivated channels and the presence of a protonable amine group. Patch-clamp experiments suggest that the binding sites of both drugs overlap the local anesthetic receptor within the ion-conducting pathway. Riluzole and lubeluzole displayed very potent antimyotonic activity in a rat model of myotonia, a pathological skeletal muscle condition characterized by high-frequency runs of action potentials. Such results well support the repurposing of riluzole as an antimyotonic drug, allowing the launch of a pilot study in myotonic patients.

However, clinical research on lubeluzole is now at a standstill, since lubeluzole seems to be associated with the acquired long QT syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. Since the cardiac cellular effects of lubeluzole have not been described thus far, an explanation for the lubeluzole-induced QT interval prolongation is lacking.METHODS: We tested the affinity of lubeluzole, its enantiomer, and the racemate for hERG channel using the patch-clamp technique. We synthesized and tested two simplified model compounds corresponding to two moieties included in the lubeluzole structure. The obtained experimental results were rationalized by docking simulation on the recently reported cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of hERG. Group efficiency analysis was performed in order to individuate the fragment most contributing to binding.RESULTS: We found that lubeluzole and its R enantiomer are highly potent inhibitors of human ether-ago-go-related gene (hERG) channel with an IC50 value of 12.9 ± 0.7 nM and 11.3 ± 0.8 nM, respectively. In the presence of lubeluzole, steady-state activation and inactivation of hERG channel were shifted to more negative potentials and inactivation kinetics was accelerated. Mutations of aromatic residues (Y652A and F656A) in the channel inner cavity significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of lubeluzole. Molecular docking simulations performed on the near atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of hERG supported the role of Y652 and F656 as the main contributors to high affinity binding. Group efficiency analysis indicated that both 1,3-benzothiazol-2-amine and 3-aryloxy-2-propanolamine moieties contribute to drug binding with the former giving higher contribution.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the possibility to modulate lubeluzole hERG blockade by introducing suitable substituents onto one or both constituting portions of the parent compound in order to either reduce potency (i. e. torsadogenic potential) or potentiate affinity (useful for class III antiarrhythmic and anticancer agent development).© 2018 The Author(s).

Interestingly, H4K12ac occupancy highly correlates with BRD4 binding and enhancer RNA production on ERα-positive enhancers. Consistent with an importance in estrogen-induced gene transcription, H4K12ac occupancy globally increased in ER-positive cells relative to ER-negative cells and these levels were further increased by estrogen treatment in an ERα-dependent manner.

We compared their efficacy in the Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study (CADISS), with the additional aim of establishing the true risk of recurrent stroke.METHODS: We did this randomised trial at hospitals with specialised stroke or neurology services (39 in the UK and seven in Australia). We included patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection with onset of symptoms within the past 7 days. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an automated telephone randomisation service to receive antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulant drugs (specific treatment decided by the local clinician) for 3 months. Patients and clinicians were not masked to allocation, but investigators assessing endpoints were. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral stroke or death in the intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered with EUDract (2006-002827-18) and ISRN (CTN44555237).FINDINGS: We enrolled 250 participants (118 carotid, 132 vertebral). Mean time to randomisation was 3·65 days (SD 1·91). The major presenting symptoms were stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n=224) and local symptoms (headache, neck pain, or Horner's syndrome; n=26). 126 participants were assigned to antiplatelet treatment versus 124 to anticoagulant treatment. Overall, four (2%) of 250 patients had stroke recurrence (all ipsilateral). Stroke or death occurred in three (2%) of 126 patients versus one (1%) of 124 (odds ratio [OR] 0·335, 95% CI 0·006-4·233; p=0·63). There were no deaths, but one major bleeding (subarachnoid haemorrhage) in the anticoagulant group. Central review of imaging failed to confirm dissection in 52 patients. Preplanned per-protocol analysis excluding these patients showed stroke or death in three (3%) of 101 patients in the antiplatelet group versus one (1%) of 96 patients in the anticoagulant group (OR 0·346, 95% CI 0·006-4·390; p=0·66).INTERPRETATION: We found no difference in efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs at preventing stroke and death in patients with symptomatic carotid and vertebral artery dissection but stroke was rare in both groups, and much rarer than reported in some observational studies. Diagnosis of dissection was not confirmed after review in many cases, suggesting that radiographic criteria are not always correctly applied in routine clinical practice.FUNDING: Stroke Association.Copyright © 2015 Markus et al.

The primary endpoint was recurrent stroke at 3 months. A systematic review was performed, and results of published studies included in a meta-analysis with the CADISS-NR results.RESULTS: In CADISS-NR, one patient in each group had recurrent ischemic stroke (antiplatelet 1/59 [1.69% ], anticoagulation 1/28 [3.57%]). At the primary endpoint of 3 months, 3 (5.08%) antiplatelet patients had recurrent TIA, compared with none in the anticoagulation group.

A general model has been proposed for heterochromatin formation and epigenetic gene silencing in different species that implies an essential role for HP1a. According to the model, histone methyltransferase enzymes (HMTases) methylate the histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me), creating selective binding sites for itself and the chromodomain of HP1a. This complex is thought to form a higher order chromatin state that represses gene activity. It has also been found that HP1a plays a role in telomere capping. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that HP1a is present at many euchromatic sites along polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, including the developmental and heat-shock-induced puffs, and that this protein can be removed from these sites by in vivo RNase treatment, thus suggesting an association of HP1a with the transcripts of many active genes. To test this suggestion, we performed an extensive screening by RIP-chip assay (RNA-immunoprecipitation on microarrays), and we found that HP1a is associated with transcripts of more than one hundred euchromatic genes. An expression analysis in HP1a mutants shows that HP1a is required for positive regulation of these genes. Cytogenetic and molecular assays show that HP1a also interacts with the well known proteins DDP1, HRB87F, and PEP, which belong to different classes of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) involved in RNA processing.

A general model has been proposed for heterochromatin formation and epigenetic gene silencing in different species that implies an essential role for HP1a. According to the model, histone methyltransferase enzymes (HMTases) methylate the histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me), creating selective binding sites for itself and the chromodomain of HP1a. This complex is thought to form a higher order chromatin state that represses gene activity. It has also been found that HP1a plays a role in telomere capping. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that HP1a is present at many euchromatic sites along polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, including the developmental and heat-shock-induced puffs, and that this protein can be removed from these sites by in vivo RNase treatment, thus suggesting an association of HP1a with the transcripts of many active genes. To test this suggestion, we performed an extensive screening by RIP-chip assay (RNA-immunoprecipitation on microarrays), and we found that HP1a is associated with transcripts of more than one hundred euchromatic genes. An expression analysis in HP1a mutants shows that HP1a is required for positive regulation of these genes. Cytogenetic and molecular assays show that HP1a also interacts with the well known proteins DDP1, HRB87F, and PEP, which belong to different classes of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) involved in RNA processing.

To probe the dependence of HP1a binding on H3K9me, its dependence on these three HKMTs, and the division of labor between the HKMTs, we have examined correlations between HP1a binding and H3K9me patterns in wild type and null mutants of these HKMTs.

HP1a binds to the promoters and within bodies of active genes in these three regions. More importantly, however, HP1a binding at promoters of active genes is independent of H3K9me and POF. Rather, it is associated with heterochromatin protein 2 (HP2) and open chromatin.

Although Eyg has been shown to act as a repressor, nothing is known about the mechanism by which it represses its target genes. Here, we show that Eyg forms a protein complex with heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). Both proteins bind to the same chromatin regions on polytene chromosomes and act cooperatively to suppress variegation and mediate gene silencing. In addition, Eyg binds to a wingless (wg) enhancer region, recruiting HP1a to assemble a closed, heterochromatin-like conformation that represses transcription of the wg gene. We describe here the evidence that suggests that Eyg, encoded by eyegone (eyg), represses wingless (wg) during eye development by association with HP1a. We show that Eyg forms a protein complex with HP1a and both proteins colocalize on salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Using position effect variegation (PEV) experiments, we demonstrated that eyg has a dose-dependent effect on heterochromatin gene silencing and identified a genetic interaction with HP1a in this process. We further demonstrated that HP1a binds to the same wg enhancer element as Eyg. DNase I sensitivity assays indicated that this enhancer region has a closed heterochromatin-like conformation, which becomes open in eyg mutants. In these mutants, much less HP1a binds to the wg enhancer region, as shown by ChIP experiments. Furthermore, as previously described for Eyg, a reduction in the amount of HP1a in the eye imaginal disc derepresses wg. Together, our results suggest a model in which Eyg specifically binds to the wg enhancer region, recruiting HP1a to that site. The recruitment of HP1a prevents transcription by favoring a closed, heterochromatin-like structure.

Mammalian DGK comprises ten isozymes (α-κ) and regulates a wide variety of physiological and pathological events, such as cancer, type II diabetes, neuronal disorders and immune responses. DG and PA consist of various molecular species that have different acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, and consequently, mammalian cells contain at least 50 structurally distinct DG/PA species. Because DGK is one of the components of phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover, the generally accepted dogma is that all DGK isozymes utilize 18:0/20:4-DG derived from PI turnover. We recently established a specific liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method to analyze which PA species were generated by DGK isozymes in a cell stimulation-dependent manner. Interestingly, we determined that DGKδ, which is closely related to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes, preferentially utilized 14:0/16:0-, 14:0/16:1-, 16:0/16:0-, 16:0/16:1-, 16:0/18:0- and 16:0/18:1-DG species (X:Y = the total number of carbon atoms: the total number of double bonds) supplied from the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C pathway, but not 18:0/20:4-DG, in high glucose-stimulated C2C12 myoblasts. Moreover, DGKα mainly consumed 14:0/16:0-, 16:0/18:1-, 18:0/18:1- and 18:1/18:1-DG species during cell proliferation in AKI melanoma cells. Furthermore, we found that 16:0/16:0-PA was specifically produced by DGKζ in Neuro-2a cells during retinoic acid- and serum starvation-induced neuronal differentiation. These results indicate that DGK isozymes utilize a variety of DG molecular species derived from PI turnover-independent pathways as substrates in different stimuli and cells. DGK isozymes phosphorylate various DG species to generate various PA species. It was revealed that the modes of activation of conventional and novel protein kinase isoforms by DG molecular species varied considerably. However, PA species-selective binding proteins have not been found to date. Therefore, we next attempted to identify PA species-selective binding proteins from the mouse brain and identified α-synuclein, which has causal links to Parkinson's disease. Intriguingly, we determined that among phospholipids, including several PA species (16:0/16:0-PA, 16:0/18:1-PA, 18:1/18:1-PA, 18:0/18:0-PA and 18:0/20:4-PA); 18:1/18:1-PA was the most strongly bound PA to α-synuclein. Moreover, 18:1/18:1-PA strongly enhanced secondary structural changes from the random coil form to the α-helix form and generated a multimeric and proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein protein. In contrast with the dogma described above, our recent studies strongly suggest that PI turnover-derived DG species and also various DG species derived from PI turnover-independent pathways are utilized by DGK isozymes. DG species supplied from distinct pathways may be utilized by DGK isozymes based on different stimuli present in different types of cells, and individual PA molecular species would have specific targets and exert their own physiological functions."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Several studies have revealed that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) can mediate phosphorylation of steroid receptors at multiple sites, including serine 81 of the androgen receptor (AR)", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the function of a protein kinase?", "id": "5e4f2aeb6d0a277941000032_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Several studies have revealed that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) can mediate phosphorylation of steroid receptors at multiple sites, including serine 81 of the androgen receptor (AR).

Injection site pain was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event, reported at similar rates in all treatment groups. Both galcanezumab doses had significantly more injection site reactions and injection site pruritus, and the 240 mg group had significantly more injection site erythema versus placebo. Conclusions Galcanezumab 120 or 240 mg given once monthly was efficacious, safe, and well tolerated. Study identification EVOLVE-2; NCT02614196; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02614196 .

Chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-SATB1 anti-body shows selective binding in vivo in the beta-globin cluster to the hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) in the locus control region (LCR) and to the epsilon-globin promoter. SATB1 overexpression increases epsilon-globin and decreases gamma-globin gene expression accompanied by histone hyperacetylation and hypomethylation in chromatin from the epsilon-globin promoter and HS2, and histone hypoacetylation and hypermethylation associated with the gamma-globin promoter. In K562 cells SATB1 family protein forms a complex with CREB-binding protein (CBP) important in transcriptional activation. In cotransfection experiments, increase in epsilon-promoter activity by SATB1 was amplified by CBP and blocked by E1A, a CBP inhibitor.

The clinical evolution at 18 months was evaluated with EMG, SFGS, biting evaluation and FDI.RESULTS: At the first clinical evaluation after reinnervation, through teeth clenching patients displayed an improvement of symmetry at rest, symmetry of voluntary movement, symmetry of smile and composite score of SFGS. Objective measurement of facial structures with FACE system demonstrated an improvement of symmetry at rest and during smile through teeth clenching. At 18 months patients displayed a good reinnervation with a further improvement of SFGS scores and reduction of functional disability. No biting deficit has been observed.CONCLUSIONS: After V-VII anastomosis, at the first rehabilitative visit, patients learn to activate the reinnervated facial muscles through teeth clenching. Eighteen months after the anastomosis, patients display a further improvement of voluntary control on facial symmetry and smile and a reduction of disability.CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Our study illustrates the rehabilitative protocol after V-VII anastomosis and analyzes the clinical evolution after this intervention in terms of recovery of facial symmetry and reduction of disability. This will be instrumental to standardize the rehabilitative protocol among different centers and to choose the best patient-tailored surgical approach for subjects affected by complete facial palsy."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "IMPORTANCE: Most rehabilitation specialists and many facial reanimation surgeons use the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (FGS) to measure and detect changes in facial function.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the purpose of the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System?", "id": "5e47568d3f5415952900001b_009", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "IMPORTANCE: Most rehabilitation specialists and many facial reanimation surgeons use the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (FGS) to measure and detect changes in facial function. The eFACE, an electronic and digitally graded facial measurement scale, was recently created to provide similar information to the Sunnybrook FGS, but with scaling uniformity across all categories of facial function, graphical outputs, and easy-to-use visual analog scales.OBJECTIVES: To establish the correlation between the scores on the eFACE and the Sunnybrook FGS among patients with facial paralysis and to compare the reliability of the 2 scales.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective review of medical records identified 109 patients who were evaluated at a facial nerve center by physical therapists using the eFACE and the Sunnybrook FGS on the same day, between November 1, 2014, and May 31, 2015. The level of facial function predicted using the 2 scales was compared to study correlation between the scales. Data analysis was conducted from June 1 to September 1, 2015.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Correlation between the Sunnybrook FGS and the eFACE grading scale.METHODS: Two independent physical therapists evaluated patients using both the eFACE and the Sunnybrook FGS. Scores were compared and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated between the total scores and each of the 3 subscores, including static, dynamic, and synkinesis scores. The total Sunnybrook FGS synkinesis score (worst score, 15; perfect score, 0) and static score (worst score, 20; perfect score, 0) were normalized to a 100-point scale with the eFACE (perfect score, 100; worst score, 1).RESULTS: eFACE scores ranged from 48 to 100, and Sunnybrook FGS scores ranged from 0 to 100. Among 109 patients, there was a moderately strong correlation between eFACE and Sunnybrook FGS scores in both total and subcategory scores. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient of the total eFACE and Sunnybrook FGS was 0.75 (r < 0.0001). For the static scores, the correlation coefficient was -0.71 (r < 0.0001). The correlation coefficients for the dynamic and synkinesis scores were 0.77 (r < 0.0001) and -0.78 (r < 0.0001), respectively.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is moderately good agreement between the Sunnybrook FGS and the eFACE. Given the ease of using the eFACE on mobile devices, as well as its additional functionality, it may represent a reasonable facial grading option across disciplines in the future.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We found this dimerization region to have sequence similarity to PDZ domains, which have been previously shown to be involved in signaling by conferring protein-protein interactions.", "answer_start": 963}], "question": "What is the function of the PDZ domain in SATB1?", "id": "5d36b5087bc3fee31f000008_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "SATB1 is expressed primarily in thymocytes and orchestrates temporal and spatial expression of a large number of genes in the T-cell lineage. SATB1 binds to the bases of chromatin loop domains in vivo, recognizing a special DNA context with strong base-unpairing propensity. The majority of thymocytes are eliminated by apoptosis due to selection processes in the thymus. We investigated the fate of SATB1 during thymocyte and T-cell apoptosis. Here we show that SATB1 is specifically cleaved by a caspase 6-like protease at amino acid position 254 to produce a 65-kDa major fragment containing both a base-unpairing region (BUR)-binding domain and a homeodomain. We found that this cleavage separates the DNA-binding domains from amino acids 90 to 204, a region which we show to be a dimerization domain. The resulting SATB1 monomer loses its BUR-binding activity, despite containing both its DNA-binding domains, and rapidly dissociates from chromatin in vivo. We found this dimerization region to have sequence similarity to PDZ domains, which have been previously shown to be involved in signaling by conferring protein-protein interactions. SATB1 cleavage during Jurkat T-cell apoptosis induced by an anti-Fas antibody occurs concomitantly with the high-molecular-weight fragmentation of chromatin of ~50-kb fragments. Our results suggest that mechanisms of nuclear degradation early in apoptotic T cells involve efficient removal of SATB1 by disrupting its dimerization and cleavage of genomic DNA into loop domains to ensure rapid and efficient disassembly of higher-order chromatin structure."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Binding studies using HD-lacking SATB1 and binding target with increased spacer between the two half-sites led us to propose a model for SATB1-DNA complex in which the HDs bind in an antiparallel fashion to the palindromic consensus element via minor groove, bridged by the PDZ-like dimerization domain", "answer_start": 676}], "question": "What is the function of the PDZ domain in SATB1?", "id": "5d36b5087bc3fee31f000008_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "To better understand DNA recognition and transcription activity by SATB1, the T-lineage-enriched chromatin organizer and transcription factor, we have determined its optimal DNA-binding sequence by random oligonucleotide selection.

Strikingly, the CSBS half-site is identical to the conserved element 'TAATA' bound by the known homeodomains (HDs). Furthermore, we show that the high-affinity binding of SATB1 to DNA is dimerization-dependent and the HD also binds in similar fashion. Binding studies using HD-lacking SATB1 and binding target with increased spacer between the two half-sites led us to propose a model for SATB1-DNA complex in which the HDs bind in an antiparallel fashion to the palindromic consensus element via minor groove, bridged by the PDZ-like dimerization domain. CSBS-driven in vivo reporter analysis indicated that SATB1 acts as a repressor upon binding to the CSBS and most of its derivatives and the extent of repression is proportional to SATB1's binding affinity to these sequences.

In the present study, we set out to address whether the PDZ-domain-mediated interactions of SATB1 are critical for its in vivo function as a global repressor. We reasoned that since the N-terminal PDZ-like domain (amino acid residues 1-204) lacks DNA binding activity, it would fail to recruit the interacting partners of SATB1 to its genomic binding sites and hence would not repress the SATB1-regulated genes. Indeed, in vivo MAR-linked luciferase reporter assay revealed that overexpression of the PDZ-like domain resulted in de-repression, indicating that the PDZ-like domain exerts a dominant negative effect on genes regulated by SATB1. Next, we developed a stable dominant negative model in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells that conditionally expressed the N-terminal 1-204 region harbouring the PDZ-like domain of SATB1. To monitor the effect of sequestration of the interaction partners on the global gene regulation by SATB1, transcripts from the induced and uninduced clones were subjected to gene expression profiling. Clustering of expression data revealed that 600 out of 19000 genes analysed were significantly upregulated upon overexpression of the PDZ-like domain.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions.

In 2012, a new human disease called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in the Middle East. MERS was caused by a virus that was originally called human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center/2012 but was later renamed as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV causes high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection, and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals. The exact origin of MERS-CoV remains unknown, but the transmission pattern and evidence from virological studies suggest that dromedary camels are the major reservoir host, from which human infections may sporadically occur through the zoonotic transmission. Human to human transmission also occurs in healthcare facilities and communities. Recent studies on Middle Eastern respiratory continue to highlight the need for further understanding the virus-host interactions that govern disease severity and infection outcome. In this review, we have highlighted the major mechanisms of immune evasion strategies of MERS-CoV. We have demonstrated that M, 4a, 4b proteins and Plppro of MERS-CoV inhibit the type I interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways and therefore facilitate innate immune evasion. In addition, nonstructural protein 4a (NSP4a), NSP4b, and NSP15 inhibit double-stranded RNA sensors. Therefore, the mentioned proteins limit early induction of IFN and cause rapid apoptosis of macrophages. MERS-CoV strongly inhibits the activation of T cells with downregulation of antigen presentation. In addition, uncontrolled secretion of interferon ɣ-induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 can suppress proliferation of human myeloid progenitor cells."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus from camels causing significant mortality and morbidity in humans in the Arabian Peninsula", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?", "id": "5e2f4a8bfbd6abf43b00002a_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus from camels causing significant mortality and morbidity in humans in the Arabian Peninsula.
