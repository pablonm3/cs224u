Results Nineteen patients received escalating doses of erdafitinib with a daily or intermittent schedule. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were hyperphosphatemia (73.7%), nausea (36.8%), stomatitis (26.3%), dysgeusia (26.3%) and dry mouth (21.1%). The maximum tolerated dose was not reached in this study.

Unraveling interactions between tumor cells and cells of the TME may identify novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets to prevent or treat metastasis. We report here the development and in vivo validation of a 3D tumor spheroid model to study the interactions between CRC cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in vitro. Co-cultured fibroblasts promoted SW620 and HCT116 CRC spheroid invasion, and this was prevented by the SRC and FGFR kinase inhibitors Dasatinib and Erdafitinib, respectively. To validate these findings in vivo, we injected SW620 cells alone or together with fibroblasts orthotopically in the caecum of mice.

Co-culture of SW620 or HCT116 CRC spheroids with endothelial cells suppressed spheroid growth while it had no effect on cancer cell migration or invasion. Consistent with this in vitro effect, co-injected endothelial cells significantly inhibited primary tumor growth in vivo. From these experiments we conclude that effects on cancer cell invasion and growth induced by co-cultured TME cells and drug treatment in the 3D spheroid model in vitro, are predictive of in vivo effects.

Formation of chromatin generally limits accessibility of specific DNA sequences and inhibits progression of polymerases as they copy information from the DNA. The processes that select sites for initiating either transcription or replication are therefore strongly influenced by factors that modulate the properties of chromatin proteins. Further, in order to elongate their products, both DNA and RNA polymerases must be able to overcome the inhibition presented by chromatin (Lipford and Bell 2001; Workman and Kingston 1998). One way to adjust the properties of chromatin proteins is to covalently modify them by adding or removing chemical moieties. Both histone and non-histone chromatin proteins are altered by acetylation, methylation, and other changes, and the 'nucleosome modifying' complexes that perform these reactions are important components of pathways of transcriptional regulation (Cote 2002; Orphanides and Reinberg 2000; Roth et al. 2001; Strahl and Allis 2000; Workman and Kingston 1998). Another way to alter the effects of nucleosomes is to change the position of the histone octamers relative to specific DNA sequences (Orphanides and Reinberg 2000; Verrijzer 2002; Wang 2002; Workman and Kingston 1998). Since the ability of a sequence to be bound by specific proteins can vary significantly whether the sequence is in the linkers between nucleosomes or at various positions within a nucleosome, 'nucleosome remodeling' complexes that rearrange nucleosome positioning are also important regulators of transcription. Since the DNA replication machinery has to encounter many of the same challenges posed by chromatin, it seems likely that modifying and remodeling complexes also act during duplication of the genome, but most of the current information on these factors relates to regulation of transcription. This chapter describes the factor known variously as FACT in humans, where it promotes elongation of RNA polymerase II on nucleosomal templates in vitro (Orphanides et al. 1998, 1999), DUF in frogs, where it is needed for DNA replication in oocyte extracts (Okuhara et al. 1999), and CP or SPN in yeast, where it is linked in vivo to both transcription and replication (Brewster et al. 2001; Formosa et al. 2001). Like the nucleosome modifying and remodeling complexes, it is broadly conserved among eukaryotes, affects a wide range of processes that utilize chromatin, and directly alters the properties of nucleosomes. However, it does not have nucleosome modifying or standard ATP-dependent remodeling activity, and therefore represents a third class of chromatin modulating factors. It is also presently unique in the extensive connections it displays with both transcription and replication: FACT/DUF/CP/SPN appears to modify nucleosomes in a way that is directly important for the efficient functioning of both RNA polymerases and DNA polymerases. While less is known about the mechanisms it uses to promote its functions than for other factors that affect chromatin, it is clearly an essential part of the complex mixture of activities that modulate access to DNA within chromatin. Physical and genetic interactions suggest that FACT/DUF/CP/SPN affects multiple pathways within replication and transcription as a member of several distinct complexes. Some of the interactions are easy to assimilate into models for replication or transcription, such as direct binding to DNA polymerase alpha (Wittmeyer and Formosa 1997; Wittmeyer et al. 1999), association with nucleosome modifying complexes (John et al. 2000), and interaction with factors that participate in elongation of RNA Polymerase II (Gavin et al. 2002; Squazzo et al. 2002). Others are more surprising such as an association with the 19S complex that regulates the function of the 20S proteasome (Ferdous et al. 2001; Xu et al. 1995), and the indication that FACT/DUF/CP/SPN can act as a specificity factor for casein kinase II (Keller et al. 2001). This chapter reviews the varied approaches that have each revealed different aspects of the function of FACT/DUF/CP/SPN, and presents a picture of a factor that can both alter nucleosomes and orchestrate the assembly or activity of a broad range of complexes that act upon chromatin."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " We suggest a three-step model in which nucleosome remodelers, general transcription factors, and the transcriptional elongation machinery are primarily involved in generating the nucleosome positioning pattern in vivo.", "answer_start": 847}], "question": "How is transcriptional elongation affected by nucleosome positioning?", "id": "5d3883a0a1e1595105000017_008", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Although the genomic pattern of nucleosome positioning is broadly conserved, quantitative aspects vary over evolutionary timescales.

TFIIS acts in the chromatin context, but its contribution to the chromatin landscape has not yet been investigated. Co-transcriptional chromatin alterations include subtle changes in nucleosome positioning, like those expected to be elicited by TFIIS, which are elusive to detect. The most popular method to map nucleosomes involves intensive chromatin digestion by micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Maps based on these exhaustively digested samples miss any MNase-sensitive nucleosomes caused by transcription. In contrast, partial digestion approaches preserve such nucleosomes, but introduce noise due to MNase sequence preferences. A systematic way of correcting this bias for massively parallel sequencing experiments is still missing.RESULTS: To investigate the contribution of TFIIS to the chromatin landscape, we developed a refined nucleosome-mapping method in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on partial MNase digestion and a sequence-bias correction derived from naked DNA cleavage, the refined method efficiently mapped nucleosomes in promoter regions rich in MNase-sensitive structures. The naked DNA correction was also important for mapping gene body nucleosomes, particularly in those genes whose core promoters contain a canonical TATA element. With this improved method, we analyzed the global nucleosomal changes caused by lack of TFIIS. We detected a general increase in nucleosomal fuzziness and more restricted changes in nucleosome occupancy, which concentrated in some gene categories. The TATA-containing genes were preferentially associated with decreased occupancy in gene bodies, whereas the TATA-like genes did so with increased fuzziness. The detected chromatin alterations correlated with functional defects in nascent transcription, as revealed by genomic run-on experiments.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of partial MNase digestion and naked DNA correction of the sequence bias is a precise nucleosomal mapping method that does not exclude MNase-sensitive nucleosomes.

This paper explores how, and to what extent, New Zealand adolescents are typically using and exposed to active cellphones and cordless phones, and considers implications of this in relation to brain tumour risk, with reference to current research findings.METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 373 Year 7 and 8 school students with a mean age of 12.3 years (range 10.3-13.7 years) from the Wellington region of New Zealand. Participants completed a questionnaire and measured their normal body-to-phone texting distances. Main exposure-metrics included self-reported time spent with an active cellphone close to the body, estimated time and number of calls on both phone types, estimated and actual extent of SMS text-messaging, cellphone functions used and people texted. Statistical analyses used Pearson Chi2 tests and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Analyses were undertaken using SPSS version 19.0.RESULTS: Both cellphones and cordless phones were used by approximately 90% of students. A third of participants had already used a cordless phone for ≥ 7 years. In 4 years from the survey to mid-2013, the cordless phone use of 6% of participants would equal that of the highest Interphone decile (≥ 1640 hours), at the surveyed rate of use. High cellphone use was related to cellphone location at night, being woken regularly, and being tired at school. More than a third of parents thought cellphones carried a moderate-to-high health risk for their child.CONCLUSIONS: While cellphones were very popular for entertainment and social interaction via texting, cordless phones were most popular for calls.

Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient latency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young adults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power levels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting sources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the cellphone radiation plume are treated as exposed, (9) exclusion of brain tumor cases because of death or illness, (10) recall accuracy of cellphone use, and (11) funding bias. The Interphone studies have all 11 flaws, and the Swedish studies have 3 flaws (8, 9 and 10).

However, no defects in the mitotic function of cohesin have been observed so far and the links between NIPBL mutations and the observed developmental defects are unclear. We show that NIPBL binds to chromatin in somatic cells with a different timing than cohesin. Further, we observe that high-affinity NIPBL binding sites localize to different regions than cohesin and almost exclusively to the promoters of active genes. NIPBL or cohesin knockdown reduce transcription of these genes differently, suggesting a cohesin-independent role of NIPBL for transcription. Motif analysis and comparison to published data show that NIPBL co-localizes with a specific set of other transcription factors. In cells derived from CdLS patients NIPBL binding levels are reduced and several of the NIPBL-bound genes have previously been observed to be mis-expressed in CdLS.

Here we use zebrafish and mouse models of CdLS to examine how transcriptional changes caused by Nipbl deficiency give rise to limb defects, a common condition in individuals with CdLS. In the zebrafish pectoral fin (forelimb), knockdown of Nipbl expression led to size reductions and patterning defects that were preceded by dysregulated expression of key early limb development genes, including fgfs, shha, hand2 and multiple hox genes. In limb buds of Nipbl-haploinsufficient mice, transcriptome analysis revealed many similar gene expression changes, as well as altered expression of additional classes of genes that play roles in limb development. In both species, the pattern of dysregulation of hox-gene expression depended on genomic location within the Hox clusters. In view of studies suggesting that Nipbl colocalizes with the mediator complex, which facilitates enhancer-promoter communication, we also examined zebrafish deficient for the Med12 Mediator subunit, and found they resembled Nipbl-deficient fish in both morphology and gene expression. Moreover, combined partial reduction of both Nipbl and Med12 had a strongly synergistic effect, consistent with both molecules acting in a common pathway. In addition, three-dimensional fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that Nipbl and Med12 are required to bring regions containing long-range enhancers into close proximity with the zebrafish hoxda cluster.

We examined genome-wide cohesin binding and its relationship to gene expression using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Nipbl+/- mice that recapitulate the CdLS phenotype.RESULTS: We found a global decrease in cohesin binding, including at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites and repeat regions. Cohesin-bound genes were found to be enriched for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at their promoters; were disproportionately downregulated in Nipbl mutant MEFs; and displayed evidence of reduced promoter-enhancer interaction. The results suggest that gene activation is the primary cohesin function sensitive to Nipbl reduction.

The antioxidants, SOD and GPx activities were significantly high in neferine pretreated UV-B groups.

The pineal hormone melatonin is recognized as the most potent endogenous antioxidant. Melatonin conducts its antioxidant effects acting directly as a radical scavenger and indirectly by up regulation of antioxidant enzymes. It has been proposed, that melatonin may have a protective effect against UVR-induced skin damage. The aim of this thesis was to: - Clarify melatonin's protective effect against UVR-induced skin damage in laboratory and clinical settings trough a systematic review of the literature. - To clinically assess the protective effect of topical treatment with melatonin against natural sun exposure, and determine the optimal concentration. - To clinically evaluate the degree of cognitive dysfunction with full body application of topical melatonin. Study 1: This was a systematic review using the databases Pubmed, EM-BASE and Cinahl. The databases were searched up to January 2013 to identify studies evaluating melatonin's protective effect against UVR-induced erythema in humans, and damage on a cellular level. Twenty studies were included, four human and 16 experimental. The results indicated that melatonin had a protective effect against UVR-induced erythema if applied before exposure, and this effect was probably obtained by melatonin acting directly as an antioxidant, and indirectly by regulating gene expression and inducing a DNA stabilizing effect. As these results were obtained using artificial UVR-sources and without investigating possible side effects, studies using natural sunlight and evaluating possible side effects of topical melatonin administration were warranted. Study 2: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We evaluated the protective effect of three different doses of topical melatonin against erythema induced by natural sun-light. The primary outcome was reduction in erythema, evaluated by chromatography, after sun exposure, when treated with topi-cal melatonin (0.5%, 2.5%, 12.5%) versus placebo and no treatment. A significant difference in erythema formation was found between areas treated with melatonin 12.5% and areas receiving placebo or no treatment. However, this was only seen in participants with an erythema reaction to the sun exposure. Further-more, the treated skin areas were very small and studies assessing any potential adverse effects were necessary. Study 3: This also was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. We assessed the degree of cognitive dysfunction with full body application of topical melatonin 12.5%. Cognition was evaluated using a neuropsychological test battery consisting of Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS), finger tapping test (FTT) and continuous reaction time (CRT). The impact on KSS was the primary outcome. We found no significant effect on cognition, however, large inter-individual variation was observed. These results support that melatonin is a safe drug for dermal application. The studies in this thesis may be valuable in the research field of melatonin's protective potential against UVR-induced oxidative skin damage. Increasing incidence of skin cancer is reported worldwide, and experts have suggested that the problem will only increase further, due to depletion of the ozone layer and the aging population. Furthermore, high-risk patient groups are emerging with the widely use of immunosuppressive medicine in various diseases, and this high-risk is in spite of use of protective measures known today. Therefore, development of new and more effective sun protective agents, with other qualities than simple chemical reflection of the UVR, is more important than ever. We have supported the suggestion of melatonin as a sun protective agent, and added the clinical relevant feature, that melatonin also has a protective effect against natural sunlight. Furthermore, we have supported the idea of melatonin being a safe drug for topical treatment, even in previous unknown high dosages. However, before any clinical implementation of melatonin as a sun protective agent can take place, further studies evaluating the long-term effects are warranted."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) derived from solar light causes skin damage by causing DNA lesions and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in keratinocytes and other epidermal cells.", "answer_start": 12}], "question": "What is known about ROS production in relation to UVR?", "id": "5e481b2cd14c9f295d00000a_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) derived from solar light causes skin damage by causing DNA lesions and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in keratinocytes and other epidermal cells. The type 2 transmembrane serine protease matriptase has characteristics that allow keratinocytes to respond to/recover from, environmental insults to the skin. This response may depend on its roles in epidermal proliferation and early differentiation, and its rapid activation in response to changes in the cellular chemical milieu, including increased oxidative stress.OBJECTIVE: We investigate the regulation of matriptase activation and its role in the response of the skin to exposure to different parts of the UV spectrum including UVA UVB, and UVR.METHODS: The activation state and distribution of matriptase in ex vivo UV exposed human skin specimens and sun damaged skin samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. HaCaT immortalized human keratinocytes were also used to investigate the mechanism of matriptase zymogen activation induced by UV irradiation. Levels of cytosolic ROS were determined by H2DCF assay. Activated matriptase, PARP and caspase 3 cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting, and the apoptotic ratio was measured by Hoechst 33258 staining.RESULTS: UVB exposure rapidly increased matriptase zymogen activation in the basal keratinocytes of skin samples. Activated matriptase was also detected at much higher levels in both the basal and spinous layer keratinocytes in sun damaged skin with actinic elastosis. UVB and solar light-induced matriptase zymogen activation likely results from UV-induced ROS generation, given that UVR, UVA, and UVB irradiation induced HaCaT human keratinocytes to activate matriptase in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and that this was suppressed by the ROS scavenger N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone and reducing agent dithiothreitol. Matriptase deficient HaCaT keratinocytes were more susceptible to UV-induced apoptosis than control cells, suggesting a protective role for matriptase in UV exposed keratinocytes.CONCLUSION: UV irradiation/ROS induced matriptase proteolysis may have short term protective effects and contribute to the recovery from acute epidermal damage and/or pathology of skin with chronic sun damage.Copyright © 2016 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

We show that NUAK1 is activated by oxidative stress and that this activation is required to facilitate nuclear import of the antioxidant master regulator NRF2: Activation of NUAK1 coordinates PP1β inhibition with AKT activation in order to suppress GSK3β-dependent inhibition of NRF2 nuclear import.

This autosomal recessive disease typically manifests later in women than men. Although it is commonly stated that pregnancy is, with menses, one of the factors that offsets iron accumulation in women, no epidemiological study has yet supported this hypothesis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of pregnancy on expression of the predominant HFE p.[Cys282Tyr];[Cys282Tyr] genotype.METHODS: One hundred and forty p.Cys282Tyr homozygous women enrolled in a phlebotomy program between 2004 and 2011 at a blood centre in western Brittany (France) were included in the study. After checking whether the disease expression was delayed in women than in men in our study, the association between pregnancy and iron overload was assessed using multivariable regression analysis.RESULTS: Our study confirms that women with HFE hemochromatosis were diagnosed later than men cared for during the same period (52.6 vs. 47.4 y., P < 0.001). Compared to no pregnancy, having at least one pregnancy was not associated with lower iron markers. In contrast, the amount of iron removed by phlebotomies appeared significantly higher in women who had at least one pregnancy (eβ = 1.50, P = 0.047). This relationship disappeared after adjustment for confounding factors (eβ = 1.35, P = 0.088).CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that pregnancy status has no impact on iron markers level, and is not in favour of pregnancy being a protective factor in progressive iron accumulation. Our results are consistent with recent experimental data suggesting that the difference in disease expression observed between men and women may be explained by other factors such as hormones."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a group of genetic iron overload disorders that manifest with various symptoms, including hepatic dysfunction, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is Hemochromatosis?", "id": "5e31cc3cfbd6abf43b000051_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a group of genetic iron overload disorders that manifest with various symptoms, including hepatic dysfunction, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy. Classic HH type 1, which is common in Caucasians, is caused by bi-allelic mutations of HFE. Severe types of HH are caused by either bi-allelic mutations of HFE2 that encodes hemojuvelin (type 2A) or HAMP that encodes hepcidin (type 2B). HH type 3, which is of intermediate severity, is caused by bi-allelic mutations of TFR2 that encodes transferrin receptor 2. Mutations of SLC40A1 that encodes ferroportin, the only cellular iron exporter, causes either HH type 4A (loss-of-function mutations) or HH type 4B (gain-of-function mutations). Studies on these gene products uncovered a part of the mechanisms of the systemic iron regulation; HFE, hemojuvelin, and TFR2 are involved in iron sensing and stimulating hepcidin expression, and hepcidin downregulates the expression of ferroportin of the target cells. Phlebotomy is the standard treatment for HH, and early initiation of the treatment is essential for preventing irreversible organ damage. However, because of the rarity and difficulty in making the genetic diagnosis, a large proportion of patients with non-HFE HH might have been undiagnosed; therefore, awareness of this disorder is important."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "hereditary hemochromatosis, an autosomal dominant iron overload condition with variable phenotypic manifestations.

In this work, we discuss clinical and molecular findings on a group of patients in whom a SLC40A1 single copy missense variant was identified. Three novel variants, p.D181N, p.G204R and p.R296Q were functionally characterized. Fpn D181N and R296Q mutants can be classified as full or partial loss of function, respectively. Replacement of G204 with arginine appears to cause a more complex defect with impact both on iron export function and hepcidin sensitivity.

Clinical penetrance is low, however those afflicted may develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomyopathy. Treatment of HH involves regular phlebotomy to reduce the systemic iron burden. In many countries-including the United States-numerous blood centers do not accept donated blood obtained from HH patients during therapeutic phlebotomy and there are inconsistent positions regarding this globally. This refusal of blood is borne out of a few concerns. First, there is a theoretical increase in the infectious risk of these blood products, particularly by siderophilic organisms such as Yersinia enterocolitica. Second, given the increased incidence of hepatitis C infection from nonvoluntary donors in the 1970s, there is a concern that blood units from HH donors may harbor additional risk given the nonvoluntary nature of their presentation. In this review, we examine the existing biological and clinical data concerning infectious risk and summarize clinical experience from centers allowing HH donors, and demonstrate that blood from HH patients is safe and should be allowed into the donor pool. We conclude that there is no convincing evidence to exclude this population from serving as blood donors.

Adult intestinal mal-rotation is a rare condition of deviation from the normal 270° counter clockwise rotation of the midgut resulting in, not only mal-position of the small intestine, but also mal-fixation of the mesentery. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a rare complication of pelvic inflammatory disease; it involves liver capsule inflammation associated with genital tract infection, which is usually caused by Neisseria gonorrhoea and Chlamydia trachomatis. Neuroendocrine tumors are enterochromaffin cell neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems; the appendicular one is the most common primary malignant lesion of these tumors, it's incidence is about 0.3 - 0.9% of appendectomies done. Just for knowledge, this is the first described case of concomitant presence of all these diseases with clinical symptoms attributable to each one.CASE PRESENTATION: 40-years-old woman suffers from acute abdominal pain, predominantly on the right quadrants, without abdominal distension, no guarding nor rigidity and normal intestinal peristalsis. She has a long history of abdominal intermittent pain, with cramps every 30-40 min, resolving spontaneously. She was diagnosed as intestinal mal-rotation through computed tomography scan which has evidenced a mobilized intra--peritoneal duodenum with cecum/ascending colon predominately lying on the left side and the small intestine almost entirely lying on the right side of abdomen, without evidence of effusion, edema or signs of intestinal ischemia or infarction. Exploratory laparoscopy demonstrated an inflammatory process in the hepatic-renal space, with bloody adhesions above the liver capsule; this is additional to the typical pelvic inflammatory disease signs (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome). Appendectomy was performed with histological analysis resulting in appendicular neuroendocrine tumor.CONCLUSIONS: Although the patient has an intestinal mal-rotation which could explain the abdominal painful symptoms, it is not possible to exclude other concomitant causes, such as perihepatitis on pelvic inflammatory disease or neuroendocrine tumors. Even if all these diseases are rarely seen in daily clinical practice, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic intermittent abdominal pain in a young woman."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "UE2343 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant 11β-HSD1 inhibitor and selected for clinical studies.

The second subdomain (two ARM repeats; ARM subdomain) specifically recognizes a bipartite N-terminal region of Spt6. Mutations that alter this region of Spt6 cause severe phenotypes in vivo. Importantly, the ARM subdomain of Iws1 is conserved in several transcription factors, including TFIIS, Elongin A and Med26. We show that the homologous region in yeast TFIIS enables this factor to interact with SAGA and the Mediator subunits Spt8 and Med13, suggesting the molecular basis for TFIIS recruitment at promoters. Taken together, our results provide new structural information about the Iws1/Spt6 complex and reveal a novel interaction domain used for the formation of transcription networks."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Spt6 (suppressor of Ty6) has many roles in transcription initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II.

We investigated the restriction fragment length polymorphism G/A-455 located in the promoter of the beta-fibrinogen gene, the guanine insertion/deletion polymorphism 4G/5G in the promoter of the PAI-1 gene, and the R353Q substitution polymorphism in exon 8 of the factor VII gene. Alleles and genotypes associated with elevated plasma levels of fibrinogen and factor VII were found with similar frequencies in centenarians and in the comparison group. However, in centenarians there was a significantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozygous 4G4G genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels.
