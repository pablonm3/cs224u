The cis-acting element Rad50 hypersensitive site 6 (RHS6) in the Th2 locus control region is essential for regulation of the Th2 cytokine genes; however, its role in allergic airway inflammation and underlying molecular mechanisms of the regulation by RHS6 are poorly understood.OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand the role of RHS6 in the development of allergic airway inflammation and its molecular mechanism for Th2 cytokine expression.METHODS: We used an ovalbumin-induced allergic inflammation model with RHS6-deficient mice to examine the role of RHS6 in this process. To examine molecular mechanism of RHS6 for Th2 cytokine expression, we used DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA, intracellular cytokine staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation.RESULTS: Deletion of RHS6 caused a dramatic resistance to allergic airway inflammation. RHS6 recruited transcription factors GATA3, SATB1, and IRF4, which play important roles in expression of all three Th2 cytokine genes. RHS6 deficiency caused inhibition of transcription factor-induced Th2 cytokine gene expression.CONCLUSION: RHS6 is a critical regulatory element for allergic airway inflammation and for coordinate regulation of Th2 cytokine genes by recruiting GATA3, SATB1, and IRF4.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Recent studies have revealed various distinct memory-type Th2 cell subsets, one of which produces a substantial amount of IFNγ in addition to Th2 cytokines, however it remains unclear precisely how these Th2 cells produce IFNγ. We herein show that phosphorylation of Gata3 at Ser308, Thr315 and Ser316 induces dissociation of a histone deacetylase Hdac2 from the Gata3/Chd4 repressive complex in Th2 cells. We also identify Akt1 as a Gata3-phosphorylating kinase, and the activation of Akt1 induces derepression of Tbx21 and Ifng expression in Th2 cells. Moreover, T-bet-dependent IFNγ expression in IFNγ-producing memory Th2 cells appears to be controlled by the phosphorylation status of Gata3 in human and murine systems. Thus, this study highlights the molecular basis for posttranslational modifications of Gata3 that control the regulation of IFNγ expression in memory Th2 cells."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2 differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation.", "answer_start": 246}], "question": "What is the role of Gata3 in Th2 cells?", "id": "5d36c0e37bc3fee31f00000b_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "CD4 T(h) are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses.

Furthermore, GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2 differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. In this review, we present an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction. GATA3 may also directly act on the Ifng gene. In summary, GATA3 serves as a transcriptional activator or repressor through direct action on transcriptional machinery and/or affecting chromatin remodeling at many critical loci encoding cytokines, cytokine receptors, signaling molecules as well as transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of T(h)1 and T(h)2 differentiation."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation induces high levels of transcription of GATA3, a master regulator of Th2 cell differentiation, and enforced expression of GATA3 induces Th2 cytokine expression.", "answer_start": 187}], "question": "What is the role of Gata3 in Th2 cells?", "id": "5d36c0e37bc3fee31f00000b_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into Th2 cells is accompanied by chromatin remodeling and increased expression of a set of Th2-specific genes, including those encoding Th2 cytokines.

A genome-wide unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation assay coupled with massive parallel sequencing analysis revealed that GATA3 bound to 1279 genes selectively in Th2 cells, and 101 genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells.

One example is genomic imprinting, which is defined as parent-of-origin mono-allelic gene expression. Imprinting is established largely due to epigenetic differences arriving in the zygote from sperm and egg haploid genomes.

In mouse, the antisense long noncoding (lnc) RNA Airn, which is paternally expressed from the differentially methylated region (DMR) in the second intron of Igf2r, is required to silence the paternal Igf2r. In opossum, however, intriguingly, the DMR was reported to be in a different downstream intron (intron 11) and there was no antisense lncRNA detected in previous analyses. Therefore, clarifying the imprinting mechanism of marsupial IGF2R is of great relevance for understanding the origin and evolution of genomic imprinting in the IGF2R locus. Thus, the antisense lncRNA associated with the marsupial DMR can be considered as the 'missing link'. In this study, we identified a novel antisense lncRNA, ALID, after detailed analysis of the IGF2R locus in an Australian marsupial, the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, and compared it to that of the grey short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica.RESULTS: Tammar IGF2R showed maternal expression and had a maternally methylated CpG island (CGI) in intron 12 as well as a promoter CGI without differential methylation, but none in the second intron. Re-analysis of the IGF2R of opossum detected the CGI in intron 12, not intron 11, as previously reported, confirming that the DMR in intron 12 is conserved between these marsupials and so is the putative imprinting control region of marsupial IGF2R. ALID is paternally expressed from the middle of the DMR and is approximately 650 bp long with a single exon structure that is extremely short compared to Airn. Hence, the lncRNA transcriptional overlap of the IGF2R promoter, which is essential for the Igf2r silencing in the mouse, is likely absent in tammar. This suggests that fundamental differences in the lncRNA-based silencing mechanisms evolved in eutherian and marsupial IGF2R and may reflect the lack of differential methylation in the promoter CGI of marsupial IGF2R.CONCLUSIONS: Our study thus provides the best candidate factor for establishing paternal silencing of marsupial IGF2R without transcriptional overlap, which is distinct from the Igf2r silencing mechanism of Airn, but which may be analogous to the mode of action for the flanking Slc22a2 and Slc22a3 gene silencing in the mouse placenta."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "gave genetics company 23andM", "answer_start": 123}], "question": "What is 23andMe?", "id": "5e7cbf1b835f4e4777000012_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Most genetic testing requires a doctor's prescription.

We identified 31,770 binding sites in the mouse genome for the PRDM9(Dom2) variant. Comparing these results with hotspot usage in vivo, we find that less than half of potential PRDM9 binding sites are utilized in vivo. We show that hotspot usage is increased in actively transcribed genes and decreased in genomic regions containing H3K9me2/3 histone marks or bound to the nuclear lamina.CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a major factor determining whether a binding site will become an active hotspot and what its activity will be are constraints imposed by prior chromatin modifications on the ability of PRDM9 to bind to DNA in vivo.

In mammals, recombination preferentially occurs in genomic regions known as hotspots; the protein that activates these hotspots is PRDM9, containing a genetically variable zinc finger (ZNF) domain and a PR-SET domain with histone H3K4 trimethyltransferase activity. PRDM9 is required for fertility in mice, but little is known about its localization and developmental dynamics. Application of spermatogenic stage-specific markers demonstrates that PRDM9 accumulates in male germ cell nuclei at pre-leptonema to early leptonema but is no longer detectable in nuclei by late zygonema. By the pachytene stage, PRDM9-dependent histone H3K4 trimethyl marks on hotspots also disappear. PRDM9 localizes to nuclei concurrently with the deposition of meiotic cohesin complexes, but is not required for incorporation of cohesin complex proteins into chromosomal axial elements, or accumulation of normal numbers of RAD51 foci on meiotic chromatin by late zygonema. Germ cells lacking PRDM9 exhibit inefficient homology recognition and synapsis, with aberrant repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks and transcriptional abnormalities characteristic of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin. Together, these results on the developmental time course for nuclear localization of PRDM9 establish its direct window of function and demonstrate the independence of chromosome axial element formation from the concurrent PRDM9-mediated activation of recombination hotspots."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In mammals, genetic recombination during meiosis is limited to a set of 1- to 2-kb regions termed hotspots.

This sets the stage for double-strand break (DSB) formation and reciprocal exchange of DNA between chromatids, forming Holliday junctions. Here we report genome-wide analyses of PRDM9-dependent histone modifications using two inbred mouse strains differing only in their PRDM9 zinc finger domain. We show that PRDM9 binding actively reorganizes nucleosomes into a symmetrical pattern, creating an extended nucleosome-depleted region. These regions are centered by a consensus PRDM9 binding motif, whose location and identity was confirmed in vitro. We also show that DSBs are centered over the PRDM9 binding motif within the nucleosome-depleted region. Combining these results with data from genetic crosses, we find that crossing-over is restricted to the region marked by H3K4me3. We suggest that PRDM9-modified nucleosomes create a permissible environment that first directs the location of DSBs and then defines the boundaries of Holliday junction branch migration."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Meiotic recombination ensures proper segregation of homologous chromosomes and creates genetic variation.

Techniques to reduce these consequences may improve outcomes.METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients undergoing lumbar discectomy for single-level herniated disk at 2 institutions were followed prospectively with clinical and radiographic evaluations at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (control cohort). A second consecutive cohort of 30 patients undergoing 31 lumbar discectomies with implantation of an annular closure device was followed similarly. Incidence of recurrent disk herniation, disk height loss, the leg and back pain visual analog scale (VAS), and the Oswestry Disability Index were assessed at each follow-up.RESULTS: Cohorts were well matched at baseline. By 2 years of follow-up, symptomatic recurrent same-level disk herniation occurred in 3 (6.5%) patients in the control cohort versus 0 (0%) patients in the annular repair cohort (P=0.27). A trend of greater preservation of disk height was observed in the annular repair versus the control cohort 3 months (7.9 vs. 7.27 mm, P=0.08), 6 months (7.81 vs. 7.18 mm, P=0.09), and 12 months (7.63 vs. 6.9 mm, P=0.06) postoperatively. The annular closure cohort reported less leg pain (VAS-LP: 5 vs. 16, P<0.01), back pain (VAS-BP: 13 vs. 22, P<0.05), and disability (Oswestry Disability Index: 16 vs. 22, P<0.05) 1 year postoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of a novel annular repair device was associated with greater maintenance of disk height and improved 1-year leg pain, back pain, and low-back disability. Recurrent disk herniation did not occur in any patient after annular repair. Closure of annular defect after lumbar discectomy may help preserve the physiological disk function and prevent long-term disk height loss and associated back and leg pain."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "his study investigated whether implantation with the Barricaid annular closure device (ACD) during discectomy reduced the rate of facet degeneration", "answer_start": 381}], "question": "What is the purpose of the Barricaid annular closure device?", "id": "5e3aab25b5b409ea5300001a_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Lumbar discectomy is an effective treatment for lumbar disc herniation (LDH).

Increased expression of two novel resistance candidates, aminopeptidase-N (CD13/ANPEP) and ETS transcription factor FLI1 was observed in the BRAFi-resistant daughter cell lines.

One mechanism of action is thought to be though the ability of biologics to induce homing and migration of endogenous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to a target tissue. However, the ability of biologics to stimulate chemotaxis (directed migration of cells) and chemokinesis (increase rate of cell migration) of MSCs is unknown.HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to directly compare the ability of biologics including platelet rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to induce MSC migration. The hypothesis was that leukocyte-low platelet rich plasma (Llo PRP) would induce migration to a greater extent than leukocyte-high platelet rich plasma (Lhi PRP) or BMC.METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated from 8 horses. Migration of MSCs toward a biologic (BMC, Llo PRP, and Lhi PRP) or the positive control platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) was continuously traced and measured for 24hrs using time-lapse microscopy and a microfluidics device. Cell migration, chemotaxis and chemokinesis were determined by measurements of displacement, number of cells migrated, and cell flux.RESULTS: All biologics resulted in a significantly greater percentage of MSCs migrated compared to the positive control (PDGF). MSCs migrated further toward BMC compared to Llo PRP. Cell migration, measured as cell flux, was greater toward BMC and Lhi PRP than Llo PRP.CONCLUSION: The biologics BMC and Lhi PRP elicit greater chemotaxis and chemokinesis of MSCs than Llo PRP. However, all biologics recruited the same number of MSCs suggesting that differences in other regenerative effects, such as growth factor concentration, between biologics should be strongly considered when choosing a biologic for treatment of musculoskeletal injuries.

Here we report the expression and the epigenetic regulation of GRP151 in the spinal cord after spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and the contribution of GPR151 to neuropathic pain in male mice. SNL dramatically increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. GPR151 mutation or spinal inhibition by shRNA alleviated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia. Interestingly, the CpG island in the GPR151 gene promoter region was demethylated, the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) was decreased, and the binding of DNMT3b with GPR151 promoter was reduced after SNL. Overexpression of DNMT3b in the spinal cord decreased GPR151 expression and attenuated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), a transcriptional factor of the KLF family, was upregulated in spinal neurons, and the binding affinity of KLF5 with GPR151 promoter was increased after SNL. Inhibition of KLF5 reduced GPR151 expression and attenuated SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity. Further mRNA microarray analysis revealed that mutation of GPR151 reduced the expression of a variety of pain-related genes in response to SNL, especially mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway-associated genes. This study reveals that GPR151, increased by DNA demethylation and the enhanced interaction with KLF5, contributes to the maintenance of neuropathic pain via increasing MAPK pathway-related gene expression.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are targets of various clinically approved drugs. Here we report that SNL increased GPR151 expression in the spinal cord, and mutation or inhibition of GPR151 alleviated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. In addition, SNL downregulated the expression of DNMT3b, which caused demethylation of GPR151 gene promoter, facilitated the binding of transcriptional factor KLF5 with the GPR151 promoter, and further increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. The increased GPR151 may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain via activating MAPK signaling and increasing pain-related gene expression.

In the nervous system of vertebrates, its expression is enriched in specific diencephalic structures, where the highest levels are observed in the habenular area. The habenula has been implicated in a range of different functions including behavioral flexibility, decision making, inhibitory control, and pain processing, which makes it a promising target for treating psychiatric and neurological disease. This study aimed to further characterize neurons expressing the Gpr151 gene, by tracing the afferent connectivity of this diencephalic cell population. Using pseudotyped rabies virus in a transgenic Gpr151-Cre mouse line, monosynaptic afferents of habenular and thalamic Gpr151-expressing neuronal populations could be visualized. The habenular and thalamic Gpr151 systems displayed both shared and distinct connectivity patterns. The habenular neurons primarily received input from basal forebrain structures, the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, the lateral preoptic area, the entopeduncular nucleus, and the lateral hypothalamic area. The Gpr151-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus was primarily contacted by medial hypothalamic areas as well as the zona incerta and projected to specific forebrain areas such as the prelimbic cortex and the accumbens nucleus. Gpr151 mRNA was also detected at low levels in the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus which received input from areas associated with visual processing, including the superior colliculus, zona incerta, and the visual and retrosplenial cortices. Knowledge about the connectivity of Gpr151-expressing neurons will facilitate the interpretation of future functional studies of this receptor."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Syndecans (SDCs) are a family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) glycoproteins ubiquitously expressed on the cell surfaces and extracellular matrix of all mammalian tissues", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What are Syndecans?", "id": "5e6e9689c6a8763d23000006_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Syndecans (SDCs) are a family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) glycoproteins ubiquitously expressed on the cell surfaces and extracellular matrix of all mammalian tissues. There are four mammalian syndecans, SDC-1 thorough 4, which play a critical role in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis through independent and growth factor mediated signaling. An altered expression of SDCs is often observed in autoimmune disorders, cancer, HIV infection, and many other pathological conditions. SDCs modulate disease progression by interacting with a diverse array of ligands, receptors, and other proteins, including extracellular matrix, glycoproteins, integrins, morphogens, and various growth factors and chemokines, along with their receptors and kinases. Specifically, SDCs present on cell surface can bind directly to chemokines to enhance their binding to receptors, downstream signaling, and migration. Alternatively, SDCs can be cleaved and shed to mediate negative regulation of chemokine and growth factor signaling pathways and ligand sequestration. Importantly, SDC shedding may be a biomarker of inflammation, especially in chronic inflammatory diseases. While the current therapies for cancer and several autoimmune disorders have revolutionized treatment outcomes, understanding the pathophysiological role of SDCs and the use of HSPG mimetic or antagonists on cytokine signaling networks may uncover potentially novel targeted therapeutic approaches. This review mainly summarizes the current findings on the role of individual SDCs in disease processes, mechanisms through which SDCs mediate their biological functions, and the possibility of targeting SDCs as future potential therapeutic approaches."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Syndecans are transmembrane proteoglycans that, together with integrins, control cell interactions with extracellular matrix components.

Force spectroscopy data, recorded by atomic force microscope, were analyzed using two theoretical approaches describing force-induced unbinding, authored by Bell-Evans and Dudko-Hummer-Szabo. Our results reveal distinct unbinding pathways dependent on the syndecan family member. Syndecan-1 unbinds by passing over two energy barriers, inner and outer. Syndecan-4 unbinds by crossing over only one energy barrier. It has already been reported that both syndecans bear heparan chains that are structurally indistinguishable.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic techniques were used for the determination of localization and distribution of the spin label 3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (PCA; logP=-1.7) within the carrier systems and the ability of the carriers to promote penetration of PCA into the skin.

PCA penetration was enhanced 2.5 fold for CMS and 1.9 fold for invasomes compared to PCA solution. Investigation of penetration depth by step-wise removal of the stratum corneum by tape stripping revealed deepest PCA penetration for invasomes. UV-irradiation of PCA-exposed skin samples revealed that the spin label is still reactive.
