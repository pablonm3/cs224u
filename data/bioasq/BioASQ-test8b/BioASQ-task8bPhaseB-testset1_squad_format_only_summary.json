The pharmacokinetics of elagolix have been well-characterized in phase I studies; however, elagolix population pharmacokinetics have not been previously reported. Therefore, a robust model was developed to describe elagolix population pharmacokinetics and to evaluate factors affecting elagolix pharmacokinetic parameters.METHODS: The data from nine clinical studies (a total of 1624 women) were included in the analysis: five phase I studies in healthy, premenopausal women and four phase III studies in premenopausal women with endometriosis.RESULTS: Elagolix population pharmacokinetics were best described by a two-compartment model with a lag time in absorption.

Coprimary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of responders (clinically meaningful pain reduction and stable or decreased rescue analgesic use) based on average monthly dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain scores. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and endometrial and bone mineral density assessments. The power of Elaris EM-III and -IV was based on the comparison to placebo in Elaris EM-I and -II with an expected 25% dropout rate.RESULTS: Between December 28, 2012, and October 31, 2014 (Elaris EM-III), and between May 27, 2014, and January 6, 2016 (Elaris EM-IV), 569 participants were enrolled.

Medical therapy is often the first line of management for women with endometriosis in order to ameliorate symptoms or to prevent post-surgical disease recurrence. Currently, there are several medical options for the management of patients with endometriosis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, being efficacious in relieving primary dysmenorrhea. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and progestins, available for multiple routes of administration, are effective first-line hormonal options. In fact, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that they succeed in improving pain symptoms in the majority of patients, are well tolerated and not expensive. Second-line therapy is represented by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Even if these drugs are efficacious in treating women not responding to COCs or progestins, they are not orally available and have a less favorable tolerability profile (needing an appropriate add-back therapy). The use of danazol is limited by the large availability of other better-tolerated hormonal drugs. Because few data are available on long-term efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors they should be administered only in women with symptoms refractory to other conventional therapies in a clinical research setting.

This review considers pros and cons of the clinical use of the drugs in reference to the current therapy with recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).RECENT FINDINGS: One or more activin type-II receptor (ActRII) ligands appear to inhibit erythroid precursors, for example growth and differentiation factor 11.

Prevention programs and curative approaches are therefore an important part of overall strategy. Curative treatments alter the dynamic of a patient's health care costs, from financial commitment over 50 years, into a potential \"one-off\" investment.

Patients received luspatercept subcutaneously once every 21 days at dose concentrations ranging from 0·125 mg/kg to 1·75 mg/kg bodyweight for five doses (over a maximum of 12 weeks). Patients in the expansion cohort were treated with 1·0 mg/kg luspatercept; dose titration up to 1·75 mg/kg was allowed, and patients could be treated with luspatercept for a maximum of 5 years. Patients in the base study were assessed for response and safety after 12 weeks in order to be considered for enrolment into the extension study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving modified International Working Group-defined haematological improvement-erythroid (HI-E), defined as a haemoglobin concentration increase of 1·5 g/dL or higher from baseline for 14 days or longer in low transfusion burden patients, and a reduction in red blood cell transfusion of 4 or more red blood cell units or a 50% or higher reduction in red blood cell units over 8 weeks versus pre-treatment transfusion burden in high transfusion burden patients. Patient data were subcategorised by: luspatercept dose concentrations (0·125-0·5 mg/kg vs 0·75-1·75 mg/kg); pre-study transfusion burden (high transfusion burden vs low transfusion burden, defined as ≥4 vs <4 red blood cell units per 8 weeks); pre-study serum erythropoietin concentration (<200 IU/L, 200-500 IU/L, and >500 IU/L); presence of 15% or more ring sideroblasts; and presence of SF3B1 mutations. Efficacy analyses were carried out on the efficacy evaluable and intention-to-treat populations. This trial is currently ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01749514 and NCT02268383.FINDINGS: Between Jan 21, 2013, and Feb 12, 2015, 58 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were enrolled in the 12 week base study at nine treatment centres in Germany; 27 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation cohorts (0·125-1·75 mg/kg) and 31 patients in the expansion cohort (1·0-1·75 mg/kg). 32 (63% [95% CI 48-76]) of 51 patients receiving higher dose luspatercept concentrations (0·75-1·75 mg/kg) achieved HI-E versus two (22% [95% CI 3-60]) of nine receiving lower dose concentrations (0·125-0·5 mg/kg). Three treatment-related grade 3 adverse events occurred in one patient each: myalgia (one [2%]), increased blast cell count (one [2%]), and general physical health deterioration (one [2%]). Two of these treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were reversible serious grade 3 adverse events: one patient (2%) had myalgia and one patient (2%) had general physical health deterioration.INTERPRETATION: Luspatercept was well tolerated and effective for the treatment of anaemia in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and so could therefore provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of anaemia associated with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes; further studies are ongoing.FUNDING: Acceleron Pharma.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Several new studies added important insights on apoC-III and its physiological function confirming its promise as a valid therapeutic target.RECENT FINDINGS: APOC3 is expressed in liver and intestine and regulates triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) catabolism and anabolism. The transcriptional regulation in both organs requires different regulatory elements. Clinical and preclinical studies established that apoC-III raises plasma triglyceride levels predominantly by inhibiting hepatic TRL clearance. Mechanistic insights into missense variants indicate accelerated renal clearance of apoC-III variants resulting in enhanced TRL catabolism. In contrast, an APOC3 gain-of-function variant enhances de novo lipogenesis and hepatic TRL production. Multiple studies confirmed the correlation between increased apoC-III levels and cardiovascular disease. This has opened up new therapeutic avenues allowing targeting of specific apoC-III properties in triglyceride metabolism.SUMMARY: Novel in vivo models and APOC3 missense variants revealed unique mechanisms by which apoC-III inhibits TRL catabolism.

The survey included questions about patients' experiences before and after volanesorsen treatment.RESULTS: Twenty-two respondents had received volanesorsen for a median of 222 days. Volanesorsen significantly reduced the number of symptoms per patient across physical, emotional, and cognitive domains. Significant reductions from baseline were reported for steatorrhea, pancreatic pain, and constant worry about an attack of pain/AP. Respondents reported that volanesorsen improved overall management of symptoms and reduced interference of FCS with work/school responsibilities.

Controversies regarding hypertriglyceridaemia as an independent risk factor for CVD have occurred partly because elevated triglyceride levels are often a component of atherogenic dyslipidaemia - they are associated with decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and increased levels of small dense LDL particles, which are highly atherogenic. Findings from several large studies indicate that elevated levels of triglycerides (either fasting or nonfasting) or, more specifically, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, are independently associated with increased risk of CVD. Possible mechanisms for this association include excessive free fatty acid release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors, and impairment of fibrinolysis. Therapeutic targeting of hypertriglyceridaemia could, therefore, reduce CVD and cardiovascular events, beyond the reduction achieved by LDL-cholesterol lowering. Elevated triglyceride levels are reduced with lifestyle interventions and fibrates, which can be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. Some new drugs are on the horizon, such as volanesorsen (which targets apolipoprotein C-III), pemafibrate, and others.

The patient was diagnosed with an incarcerated right inguinal hernia and underwent emergent surgical repair. Intraoperatively a reactive fluid was found within the hernia sac that prompted an exploratory laparotomy for suspected bowel perforation. The hernia was then found to contain an inflamed gangrenous appendix with an inflamed and perforated cecum. An ileocecectomy and enteroenterostomy was performed and the hernia defect was repaired without mesh.DISCUSSION: With an estimated incidence of only 1%, Amyand's hernias are rare and lack a clear evidence-based management scheme. Moreover, they can contain a diverse range of pathologic features and presentations that can complicate diagnosis and treatment. To avoid potential morbidity and mortality, the surgeon must consider an Amyand's hernia on his or her differential when operating on inguinal hernias and be aware of the associated presentations, complications, and management schemes.CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of reports describing simultaneous appendicitis and cecal perforation within an Amyand's hernia.

This rare entity is named after the French born English surgeon, Dr. Claudius Amyand. Inguinal hernias are one of the most common surgeries that a general surgeon performs with more than 20 million inguinal hernia repairs performed yearly worldwide. The incidence of finding an appendix within the hernia sac is rare, occurring in less than 1% of inguinal hernia patients and when complications arise such as inflammation, perforation, or abscess formation it becomes exceptionally rare with an incidence of about 0.1%.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 59-year-old male with a history of a previously reducible right inguinal hernia presented to the Emergency Department with acute abdominal pain, right groin mass. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed a right incarcerated inguinal hernia with herniated loops of bowel within the right inguinal region. Patient was subsequently treated with an appendectomy and tension free hernia repair with mesh with a successful outcome.DISCUSSION: The current generally accepted treatment algorithm for Amyand's hernia is essentially contingent on the appendix's condition within the hernia sac. Controversy exists regarding the application of mesh in type 2 Amyand's hernia. More research is needed to provide surgeons with evidence-based standardized approaches for dealing with this unique situation.CONCLUSION: This case report reviews a rare entity known as an Amyand's hernia that presented as an incarcerated hernia that was diagnosed intraoperatively with an inflamed appendix, recognized as a type 2 Amyand's hernia.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

MRI demonstrated a 4 cm wide and 2 cm tall nidus and catheter angiography was performed to further define the vascular supply and drainage. The patient underwent transvenous endovascular embolization followed by surgical excision via a bicoronal incision, as shown in this operative video. Care was taken to identify, cauterize, and transect feeding vessels from the superficial temporal, supratrochlear, and supraorbital arteries circumferentially to completely devascularize and resect the galeal nidus from overlying scalp tissue and underlying pericranium. Previously unreported in the literature, transosseous emissary veins partially draining the lesion were noted on angiography and were waxed thoroughly during surgery. Six-month follow-up examination demonstrated a well-healed incision without evidence of AVM recurrence.

All except one patient were males who were in the second and third decades of life. History of trauma was present in 6 patients. In one patient, the lesion had been present since birth. Occipital and frontal regions were the sites commonly involved. Superficial temporal, occipital and posterior auricular arteries were the most frequent feeding arteries.

Our results show that h-cNDs have remarkable free radical scavenging ability and preserve the enzymatic activity of catalase after γ-irradiation.

These systems are computationally tractable prototypes to simulate water radiolysis reactions-i.e. the PCT processes that generate the DNA-damaging species against cancerous cells. To capture incipient bulk-water effects, ten (H2O)1-6 isomers are considered, ranging from quasi-planar/multiplanar (H2O)1-6 to \"smallest-drop\" prism and cage (H2O)6 structures. SLEND is a time-dependent, variational, non-adiabatic and direct method that adopts a nuclear classical-mechanics description and an electronic single-determinantal wavefunction in the Thouless representation. Short-time SLEND/6-31G* (n = 1-6) and /6-31G** (n = 1-5) simulations render cluster-to-projectile 1-electron-transfer (1-ET) total integral cross sections (ICSs) and 1-ET probabilities. In absolute quantitative terms, SLEND/6-31G* 1-ET ICS compares satisfactorily with alternative experimental and theoretical results only available for n = 1 and exhibits almost the same accuracy of the best alternative theoretical result. SLEND/6-31G** overestimates 1-ET ICS for n = 1, but a comparable overestimation is also observed with another theoretical method. An investigation on H+ + H indicates that electron direct ionization (DI) becomes significant with the large virtual-space quasi-continuum in large basis sets; thus, SLEND/6-31G** 1-ET ICS is overestimated by DI contributions. The solution to this problem is discussed. In relative quantitative terms, both SLEND/6-31* and /6-31G** 1-ET ICSs precisely fit into physically justified scaling formulae as a function of the cluster size; this indicates SLEND's suitability for predicting properties of water clusters with varying size. Long-time SLEND/6-31G* (n = 1-4) simulations predict the formation of the DNA-damaging radicals H, OH, O and H3O. While \"smallest-drop\" isomers are included, no early manifestations of bulk water PCT properties are observed and simulations with larger water clusters will be needed to capture those effects.

Iodine tablets should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur.

No information is available in literature about γ-sterilization effects on vancomycin HCl-loaded poly (ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) microspheres.OBJECTIVE: Formulations were developed using a different preparation approach for the treatment of medical device-related osteomyelitis, and γ-sterilization effects on the physicochemical characterization of the formulations were examined.METHODS: Water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsion technique using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in inner and outer phase was applied to prepare formulations. Physicochemical properties of the formulations were investigated before and after γ-sterilization and the antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) were measured.RESULTS: The particle size of the nonsterilized formulations were between 58 and 134 μm. 60% or 20% of vancomycin HCl were released from 42.500 Mn or 70.000-90.000 Mn PCL microspheres, respectively, in 24 h. No difference was observed in the particle size, drug-loading efficiency, morphology, in vitro release and antimicrobial activity of the formulations after γ-sterilization (p > 0.05)."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Gamma sterilization is usually used to minimize the risk of infection transmission through bone allografts.

The aim of this study was to investigate the radioprotective effects of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) free radical scavenger on the material properties of sterilized bovine cortical bone at microstructure level. Forty-two cortical tissue specimens were excised from three bovine femurs and irradiated to 35 and 70 kGy gamma rays in the presence of 5, 50, and 100 mM concentrations of NAC. The localized variations in microhardness were evaluated via indentation in the radial and longitudinal directions to examine different regions of the microstructures of the specimens, including the osteonal and interstitial tissues. A significant increase was observed in the hardness of osteonal, interstitial, and longitudinal combined microstructures exposed to 35 and 70 kGy radiations (P < 0.05), whereas a relative reduction of the hardness was observed in the radial direction. Furthermore, it was found that the application of 50 and 100 mM NAC during gamma irradiation significantly subsided the hardening in longitudinal combined microstructure. Moreover, the reduction of hardness in radial direction was suppressed in the presence of 100 mM of NAC.

Recently, treatment of irradiated allografts with free radical scavengers is used to protect them against radiation-induced damages. This study aimed to investigate the radioprotective role of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) during the gamma sterilization of the cortical bone of bovine femurs using the compressive test. Totally, 195 cubic specimens with a dimension of 5 × 5 × 3 cubic mm were divided into 13 groups including a control and 12 experimental groups exposed to 18, 36, and 70 kGy at three different NAC concentrations (1.25, 12.5, and 25 mM for 18 kGy; 5, 50, and 100 mM for 36 kGy; 10, 100, and 200 mM for 70 kGy). The mechanical behavior of the sterilized specimens was studied using the uniaxial compressive test. The results indicated a concentration-dependent radioprotection effect of NAC on the plastic properties of the cortical bones. The concentration dependency of NAC was in turn related to radiation dose levels. In conclusion, treatment of bone specimens with a characteristic concentration of NAC during exposure to specific radiation dose levels can provide an efficient radioprotection window for preserving the mechanical stability of gamma sterilized allografts."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "It was determined that gamma sterilization was the preferred sterilization method of choice for this device.

Estimates of whole-body effective dose are based on the assumptions that the radiation is incident from the front and in a uniform beam. We sought to investigate these assumptions and also to quantify doses associated with different activities.METHODS: A single technologist wore 3 electronic dosimeters for 3 mo, at the front waist, the back waist, and the front collar. The technologist also recorded her activities throughout the day.RESULTS: We found that the assumption of an anterior beam held about two thirds of the time, breaking down only when the technologist was receiving lower doses. Overall, the average whole-body dose was estimated correctly by assuming an anterior beam. We also found that irradiation was uniform (i.e., waist and collar badges gave equivalent readings) except when the technologist was performing injections. Then, the collar readings were 1.7 times the waist readings. Finally, average doses were measured for different types of activities. Performing injections registered a dose rate of approximately 2 microSv/h. Doses received while scanning ranged from 0.2 to 2 microSv/h. The average dose for a scan depended not only on the administered activity and isotope but also on the amount of patient contact required. Even for high activities, such as patients who had already received therapy, the dose to the technologist was low for patients requiring little assistance.CONCLUSION: The assumption of anterior irradiation correctly estimates whole-body effective dose. The assumption of a uniform beam is good except when injections are being performed, when the upper torso receives a much higher dose than the waist. Overall, doses to the technologist were found to be 5.4 microSv/d for scanning and 12 microSv/d for injections. These correspond to 1.4 mSv/y and 3.2 mSv/y, respectively, which are comparable to naturally occurring radiation levels and are much lower than regulatory limits. However, if the dose to a particular technologist needs to be minimized (e.g., for a pregnant worker), the most effective strategy is for the technologist to be assigned patients requiring little contact or assistance and, in particular, to avoid administering injections."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " The reconstruction of lifetime radiation doses for medical workers presents special challenges not commonly encountered for the other worker cohorts comprising the Million Worker Study (MWS)", "answer_start": 11}], "question": "Who should wear dosimeters?", "id": "5e49032df8b2df0d49000008_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: The reconstruction of lifetime radiation doses for medical workers presents special challenges not commonly encountered for the other worker cohorts comprising the Million Worker Study (MWS).METHODS: The selection of approximately 175,000 medical radiation workers relies on using estimates of lifetime and annual personal monitoring results collected since 1977.

This evidence supports the recent statement from International Radiation Protection Association that 'for the nuclear industry and other non-medical sectors the use of a whole body dosimeter is considered likely to be sufficient for the majority of workers'."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cell-free RNA (cfRNA), RNA associated to platelets and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are some of the materials that can be derived from the blood of cancer patients.", "answer_start": 655}], "question": "What is circulating free DNA ( cfDNA)?", "id": "5cc0817da49efeb44c000002_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Testing of tumor tissue remains the recommended method for detecting the presence of somatic mutations in human malignancies. V600E is the most frequent somatic point mutation in metastatic melanoma, providing a unique molecular marker for this malignancy. In addition, tumors carrying this mutation are primary candidates for BRAF-targeted therapy. Although metastatic melanoma patients usually have sufficient tumor tissue available for genetic analyses, the detection of V600E in blood can have prognostic and predictive value. In addition, patients are rarely re-biopsied and genetic testing in blood can be useful for monitoring response to therapy. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cell-free RNA (cfRNA), RNA associated to platelets and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are some of the materials that can be derived from the blood of cancer patients. cfDNA can be easily purified from serum and plasma and contains DNA fragments of tumor origin. For this reason, it is the most widely used material for the detection of somatic mutations in blood. Several methodologies have been used to determine V600E status in the cfDNA of metastatic melanoma and some studies have demonstrated that the identification and follow-up of V600E in cfDNA can have prognostic and predictive value."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Known to be present in the blood of cancer patients for decades, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is beginning to inform on tumor genetics, tumor burden, and mechanisms of progression and drug resistance.

Because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity and comorbidities associated with obtaining tumor tissues, especially in the case of metastatic disease, traditional methods for tumor sampling are impractical for this application. Known to be present in the blood of cancer patients for decades, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is beginning to inform on tumor genetics, tumor burden, and mechanisms of progression and drug resistance. This substrate is amenable for inexpensive noninvasive testing and thus presents a viable approach to serial sampling for screening and monitoring tumor progression. The fragmentation, low yield, and variable admixture of normal DNA present formidable technical challenges for realization of this potential. This review summarizes the history of cfDNA discovery, its biological properties, and explores emerging technologies for clinically relevant sequence-based analysis of cfDNA in cancer patients. Molecular barcoding (or Unique Molecular Identifier, UMI)-based methods currently appear to offer an optimal balance between sensitivity, flexibility, and cost and constitute a promising approach for clinically relevant assays for near real-time monitoring of treatment-induced mutational adaptations to guide evidence-based precision oncology.

Detection rates were estimated by meta-analysis and modeling. The marginal cost associated with the detection of additional cases using cfDNA was estimated from the difference in average costs divided by the difference in detection.RESULTS: The main factor was the unit cost of cfDNA testing. For example, replacing a combined test costing $150 with 3% false-positive rate and invasive testing at $1000, by cfDNA tests at $2000, $1500, $1000, and $500, the marginal cost is $8.0, $5.8, $3.6, and $1.4m, respectively. Costs were lower when replacing a quadruple test and higher for a 5% false-positive rate, but the relative importance of cfDNA unit cost was unchanged. A contingent policy whereby 10% to 20% women were selected for cfDNA testing by conventional screening was considerably more cost-efficient. Costs were sensitive to cfDNA uptake.CONCLUSION: Universal cfDNA screening for Down syndrome will only become affordable by public health purchasers if costs fall substantially. Until this happens, the contingent use of cfDNA is recommended.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "cfDNA was isolated from a serum specimen before chemotherapy.

With the introduction of new drugs the need to identify nonresponders is increasing. To our knowledge there are no prognostic parameters to date for use upon the initiation of any treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: cfDNA was isolated from a serum specimen before chemotherapy. Its value was correlated to recurrence-free and overall survival using Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors.RESULTS: Of 59 men 48 (81.4%) had a measurable prostate specific antigen decrease from baseline. Median followup was 15.0 months (range 2.4 to 58.4). The median cfDNA concentration in all men in this study was 27.71 ng/ml (mean 32.64). A threshold of 55.03 ng/ml was significantly associated with a poor prostate specific antigen response of less than 30% (p = 0.005). On univariate and multivariate analysis circulating cfDNA was an independent predictor of overall survival (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.97, p = 0.044 and HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.91, p = 0.032, respectively). Limitations of the study are its retrospective character, and first and second line therapies.CONCLUSIONS: Our trial shows that the cfDNA concentration before therapy may be a useful predictive and prognostic biomarker for prostate specific antigen response and survival.Copyright © 2015 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

Fetal monogenic diseases have also been shown to be amenable to non-invasive detection by maternal plasma DNA analysis. A number of recent technological developments in this area has increased the level of clinical interest, particularly as one approach does not require customized reagents per mutation. The mutational status of the fetus can be assessed by determining which parental haplotype that fetus has inherited based on the detection of haplotype-associated SNP alleles in maternal plasma. Such relative haplotype dosage analysis requires the input of the parental haplotype information for interpretation of the fetal inheritance pattern from the maternal plasma DNA data. The parental haplotype information can be obtained by direct means, reducing the need to infer haplotypes using DNA from other family members. The technique also allows the assessment of complex mutations and has multiplexing capabilities where a number of genes and mutations can be assessed at the same time. These advantages allow non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal monogenic diseases to be much more scalable. These applications may drive the next wave of clinical adoption of cell-free fetal DNA testing."}]}]}
