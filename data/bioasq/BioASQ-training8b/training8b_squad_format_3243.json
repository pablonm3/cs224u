The aim of this study was to explore the effect and mechanism of chrysophanol on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced anti-inflammatory effect of RAW264.7 cells and its involved potential mechanism. The mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and PPAR-γ were measured by qRT-PCR and western blotting, the production of TNF-α, IL-1β was evaluated by ELISA. Then, the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 was also detected by western blotting. And NF-κB p65 promoter activity was analyzed by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system as well. Meanwhile, PPAR-γ inhibitor GW9662 was performed to knockdown PPAR-γ expression in cells. Our data revealed that LPS induced the up-regulation of TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and NF-κB p65, the down-regulation of PPAR-γ were substantially suppressed by chrysophanol in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, our data also figured out that these effects of chrysophanol were largely abrogated by PPAR-γ inhibitor GW9662.

Chrysophanol (CHR) is one of traditional Chinese medicine which was reported to show protective effects in cognition dysfunction and inflammatory in previously studies. In this current study, whether CHR protects learning and memory dysfunctions induced by diabetes disease or not and underlying mechanisms were studied. DE model was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, i.p.) in ICR mice. CHR was administrated 3 days after STZ treated mice which was confirmed with diabetes for consecutive 6 days. Learning and memory function was tested by Morris water maze after the CHR injection. The morphology of neuronal cells in hippocampus CA3 region was stained by HE-staining. ELISA and Western blot assay were used to determine the levels of pro-inflammation cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α) in hippocampus. Here, we demonstrated that mice harboring diabetes mellitus induced by STZ exhibit high blood glucose, learning and memory deficits detected by Morris water maze behavior tests. Application with CHR right after developing diabetes disease rescues partial blood sugar increasing, learning and memory deficits. The data also indicated that the death rate of neurons and the number of astrocytes in hippocampus CA3 region was significantly improved in diabetic mice. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of CHR's protective effect are likely associated with anti-inflammation by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammation cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α) in hippocampus and inhibiting the over-activation of astrocytes in hippocampus CA3 region. Therefore, application with CHR contributes to the learning and memory deficits induced by diabetes disease via inhibitory expressions of inflammatory in hippocampus region."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Chrysophanol is a phytochemical typically extracted from rhubarb.

Similar to other extracts from rhubarb, chrysophanol possesses anticancer activity against diverse cancerous cells. However, the apoptotic effects of chrysophanol in ovarian cancer remain unknown. In the current study, we examined the antitumorigenic activity of chrysophanol in human epithelial ovarian cancer cells, such as ES2 and OVCAR3. Chrysophanol decreased cell viability and increased cell death in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, chrysophanol markedly increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species production in ES2 cells, but only increased it slightly in OVCAR3 cells. Consistent with increased reactive oxygen species production, extensive lipid peroxidation was detected in chrysophanol-treated ES2 cells compared with that in untreated cells, whereas lipid peroxidation was unchanged in OVCAR3 cells in response to chrysophanol. Although there were no significant changes in calcium ions in the of ES2 and OVCAR3 cells, the concentration of calcium in the mitochondria increased dose dependent through disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential in both ES2 and OVCAR3 cells compared with nontreated control cells. Moreover, chrysophanol activated the MAPK signaling pathways in the ovarian cancer cells. In addition, ovarian cancer cell invasiveness was suppressed, which implied that chrysophanol plays a role in preventing ovarian cancer metastasis.

However, effects of chrysophanol on human choriocarcinoma cells are not known. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine effects of chrysophanol on choriocarcinoma cells (JAR and JEG-3) and identify signal transduction cascades activated by chrysophanol. Results of present study, showed that chrysophanol decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis of JEG-3, but not JAR cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Chrysophanol also increased oxidative stress in JEG-3 cells by inducing ROS generation followed by mitochondrial dysfunction including depolarization of mitochondrial inner membrane potential. Western blot analysis revealed that ERK1/2, P90RSK, AKT, and P70S6K were increased significantly in JEG-3 cells by chrysophanol. Next, we investigated chrysophanol-mediated effects on proliferation of JEG-3 cells using pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K/AKT (LY294002) and ERK1/2 (U0126). Inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 prevented chrysophanol-induced stimulation of proliferation of JEG-3 cells. In addition, the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 was suppressed by LY294002 and U0126 in JEG-3 cells treated with chrysophanol, whereas, the AKT protein was activated by pre-treatment of JEG-3 cells with U0126. Furthermore, we compared therapeutic effects of chrysophanol with cisplatin and paclitaxel which are conventional salvage regimens for choriocarcinoma. Our results verified that chrysophanol has synergistic effects with traditional therapy to increase apoptosis of JEG-3 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that chrysophanol is a potential effective chometherapeutic agent for treatment of choriocarcinoma therapy, and minimizing side effects of conventional treatment regimens.

Aβ is produced from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) followed by γ-secretase. Verubecestat is an oral BACE-1 inhibitor that reduces the Aβ level in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 78-week trial to evaluate verubecestat at doses of 12 mg and 40 mg per day, as compared with placebo, in patients who had a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The coprimary outcomes were the change from baseline to week 78 in the score on the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog; scores range from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating worse dementia) and in the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory scale (ADCS-ADL; scores range from 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating worse function).RESULTS: A total of 1958 patients underwent randomization; 653 were randomly assigned to receive verubecestat at a dose of 12 mg per day (the 12-mg group), 652 to receive verubecestat at a dose of 40 mg per day (the 40-mg group), and 653 to receive matching placebo. The trial was terminated early for futility 50 months after onset, which was within 5 months before its scheduled completion, and after enrollment of the planned 1958 patients was complete. The estimated mean change from baseline to week 78 in the ADAS-cog score was 7.9 in the 12-mg group, 8.0 in the 40-mg group, and 7.7 in the placebo group (P=0.63 for the comparison between the 12-mg group and the placebo group and P=0.46 for the comparison between the 40-mg group and the placebo group). The estimated mean change from baseline to week 78 in the ADCS-ADL score was -8.4 in the 12-mg group, -8.2 in the 40-mg group, and -8.9 in the placebo group (P=0.49 for the comparison between the 12-mg group and the placebo group and P=0.32 for the comparison between the 40-mg group and the placebo group). Adverse events, including rash, falls and injuries, sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, weight loss, and hair-color change, were more common in the verubecestat groups than in the placebo group.CONCLUSIONS: Verubecestat did not reduce cognitive or functional decline in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease and was associated with treatment-related adverse events.

Therefore, major efforts are being made to hone in on NK cell antitumour properties in immunotherapy. In the clinical setting, haploidentical NK cells can be adoptively transferred to help treat cancer. To expand NK cells in vivo and enhance tumour targeting, IL-15 is being tested in combination with a glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 inhibitor (CHIR99021), an inhibitor that has been shown to expand mature, highly functional NK cells capable of killing multiple tumour targets. One major limitation to NK cell therapy is lack of specificity. To address this concern, bispecific or trispecific engagers that target NK cells to the tumour and an ADAM17 inhibitor that prevents CD16 shedding after NK cell activation are being tested.

CD16A downregulation takes place in cancer patients and this may affect the efficacy of tumor-targeting mAbs. We examined the effects of MEDI3622, a human mAb and potent ADAM17 inhibitor, on NK cell activation by antibody-bound tumor cells. MEDI3622 effectively blocked ADAM17 function in NK cells and caused a marked increase in their production of IFNγ. This was observed for NK cells exposed to different tumor cell lines and therapeutic antibodies, and over a range of effector/target ratios. The augmented release of IFNγ by NK cells was reversed by a function-blocking CD16A mAb. In addition, NK92 cells, a human NK cell line that lacks endogenous FcγRs, expressing a recombinant non-cleavable version of CD16A released significantly higher levels of IFNγ than NK92 cells expressing equivalent levels of wildtype CD16A. Taken together, our data show that MEDI3622 enhances the release of IFNγ by NK cells engaging antibody-bound tumor cells by blocking the shedding of CD16A.

ADAM17 can be activated by stimulation of several tyrosine kinase receptors, raising questions about whether oncogenic tyrosine kinases could also enhance EGFR signaling and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) via stimulation of ADAM17. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the role of Src in activating ADAM17. We provide evidence that a constitutively active transforming form of Src, the E378G mutant, as well as v-Src enhance ADAM17-mediated shedding of the EGFR ligand TGFα. Moreover, we demonstrate that constitutive shedding of TGFα can be reduced by inhibition of Src in several cell lines, including COS7, MCF7 (the human breast cancer cell line), PAE (a pig aortic endothelial cell line) and HaCaT (the human keratinocyte cell line) cells. Src(E378G)-stimulated shedding of TGFα is abolished in Adam17(-/-) cells, but can be rescued by wild-type (wt) ADAM17 and a mutant ADAM17 lacking its cytoplasmic domain. These findings demonstrate that ADAM17 is the principal TGFα sheddase that is activated by Src in a manner that does not require the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17. Finally, we show that stimulation of ADAM17 by Src(E378G) leads to enhanced paracrine signaling via release of EGFR ligands into the culture supernatant. These results raise the possibility that activation of ADAM17 by oncogenic forms of Src can aid in promoting tumorigenesis by enhancing signaling via the EGFR and ERK in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Enhanced autocrine signaling could further activate tumor cells expressing oncogenic mutants of Src, whereas paracrine signaling could stimulate EGFR and ERK signaling in surrounding non-transformed cells such as stromal cells, thereby contributing to crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Here we demonstrate that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17), a main sheddase for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, is essential for defensive epithelial properties against UC by promoting epithelial cell growth and goblet cell differentiation in mouse and human.", "answer_start": 88}], "question": "What is the role of metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) in NK cells?", "id": "5c6ffc5b7c78d69471000057_012", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Epithelial regeneration is a key process for the recovery from ulcerative colitis (UC).

Full-text journals and case studies were included, and data synthesis was performed individually.RESULTS: Etiology remains unclear for all three disease entities. Etiological relatedness to chronic inflammatory bowel disease is under discussion and effectiveness was found for different treatments, e.g. local triamcinolone injections, antibiotics, surgical interventions, TNF alpha blockers or exclusive enteral nutrition. No randomized controlled trial concerning the therapy of orofacial granulomatosis was found. As a consequence, the therapeutic conclusion is drawn mainly from small case series, thus limiting the evidence of therapeutic interventions.CONCLUSION: OFG with the sub-entities MRS and cheilitis granulomatosa is an etiological obscure disease process with various possible therapeutic interventions potentially alleviating the disease course but to broaden treatment knowledge further study in randomized controlled trials is needed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Melkersson Rosenthal syndromes (MRS) is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited neurocutaneous syndrome characterised by a triad of facial (seventh cranial) nerve palsy, recurrent orofacial swelling and fissuring of the tongue.

When it presents in a triad encompassing facial nerve palsy, lip swelling, and fissured or furrowed tongue it is called Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome while monosymptomatic or oligosymptomatic forms are referred to as granulomatous cheilitis. It is an uncommon clinicopathologic entity which is distinct from classic Crohn's disease. The NOD2 variant which is commonly associated with Crohn's has not been shown to have any association with orofacial granulomatosis.CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 31-year-old white man who had painful swelling of the lip with oral ulcers and difficulty eating for 2 to 3 years. He was diagnosed as having granulomatous cheilitis based on characteristic biopsy findings. There was serologic evidence of Crohn's disease with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies. However, he was not found to have any gastrointestinal involvement based on computed tomography enterography, and upper and lower endoscopies. He failed to respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and dapsone therapy but responded well to high doses of infliximab.CONCLUSIONS: Our case questions whether granulomatous cheilitis really exists or is it simply a variant of Crohn's disease with only oral presentation. Our patient did not have symptoms of Crohn's disease; moreover, endoscopic studies and computed tomography enterography were unremarkable for evidence of intestinal involvement. Our case is also the first reported case where high-dose infliximab alone has been used with sustained response for approximately 8 months. In conclusion, more research is needed to assess the underlying pathology as well as ideal treatment options for patients with orofacial granulomatosis.

The classic triad is not seen frequently in its complete form; therefore, diagnosis is difficult. This is particularly true because monosymptomatic and oligosymptomatic variants are seen more commonly. Cheilitis granulomatosa of Miescher is an example of a monosymptomatic variant of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The histologic findings of noncaseating, sarcoidal granulomas support the diagnosis. These granulomas are not invariably present, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Thus, the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a disease with elements of orofacial granulomatosis. Orofacial granulomatosis is a clinicopathologic entity describing oral lesions with noncaseating granulomas. The spectrum of this entity includes patients with oral Crohn's disease, patients with oral lesions who will develop typical bowel symptoms of Crohn's disease in the ensuing months to years, patients with tooth-associated infections, patients with sarcoidosis, and patients with food or contact allergies. The value of the clinicopathologic construct of orofacial granulomatosis is to provoke the careful search for provocative causes for the reactive symptom complex of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is classically described as a triad of orofacial swelling, facial palsy, and fissured tongue.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the triad of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome?", "id": "5c6f14297c78d69471000052_017", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is classically described as a triad of orofacial swelling, facial palsy, and fissured tongue.

Fecal microbiota transplantation's success as a therapy for C. difficile has inspired interest in performing clinical trials that experiment with fecal microbiota transplantation as a therapy for other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. Results from clinical trials that use fecal microbiota transplantation to treat inflammatory bowel disease suggest that, for at least one condition beyond C. difficile, most fecal microbiota transplantation donors produce stool that is not efficacious. The optimal strategies for identifying and using efficacious donors have not been investigated. We therefore examined the optimal Bayesian response-adaptive strategy for allocating patients to donors and formulated a computationally tractable myopic heuristic. This heuristic computes the probability that a donor is efficacious by updating prior expectations about the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation, the placebo rate, and the fraction of donors that produce efficacious stool. In simulations designed to mimic a recent fecal microbiota transplantation clinical trial, for which traditional power calculations predict [Formula: see text] statistical power, we found that accounting for differences in donor stool efficacy reduced the predicted statistical power to [Formula: see text]. For these simulations, using the heuristic Bayesian allocation strategy more than quadrupled the statistical power to [Formula: see text].

Patients were prospectively followed both clinically and with stool assessments for 8 weeks post FMT. Assessments occurred at 1 week and 4 weeks post FMT to assess for failure. Failure was defined as presence of diarrhoeal symptoms and a positive CDI stool test by polymerase chain reaction for toxin gene (PCR) at any time point during the 8-week follow-up period. CDI stool testing using PCR was performed at weeks 1 and 4 post FMT in asymptomatic patients as well.RESULTS: 167 patients were included. Twenty-eight patients (16.7% (28/167)) were FMT failures throughout the 8-week period. At week 1, seven patients had already failed the FMT. Of the remaining 160 patients, 144 were asymptomatic, and among these, 141 were negative for C. difficile toxin gene by PCR. This resulted in an asymptomatic carriage rate of 2.1% (3/144). At week 4, 143 patients had not yet failed FMT. Of these patients 129 patients were asymptomatic and among those, 125 were negative by PCR, resulting in an asymptomatic carriage rate of 3% (3/129).CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic carriage after FMT is rare.

Here we investigated changes in the fecal microbiota structure following FMT in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, and imputed a hypothetical functional profile based on the 16S rRNA profile using a predictive metagenomic tool. Increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased abundance of Proteobacteria were observed following FMT. The fecal microbiota of recipients following transplantation was more diverse and more similar to the donor profile than the microbiota prior to transplantation. Additionally, we observed differences in the imputed metagenomic profile. In particular, amino acid transport systems were overrepresented in samples collected prior to transplantation.

In a subgroup analysis of patients with cognitive impairment (MMSE score ≥21 but ≤24), the observed improvement on the SAPS-PD with pimavanserin (N=50) was also significant (p=0.002) and larger than in the overall study population without an adverse effect on cognition. In a Phase 2 study with pimavanserin in Alzheimer's disease psychosis, pimavanserin significantly (p=0.045) improved psychosis at Week 6 vs. placebo on the NPI-NH Psychosis Score (PS). In a prespecified subgroup of patients with a baseline NPI-NH PS ≥12, a substantively larger treatment effect (p=0.011) was observed vs. participants with NPI-NH PS <12. The results of these studies in cognitively impaired patients with PDP provided the scientific foundation for an ongoing study of pimavanserin for treating patients with dementia-related psychosis associated with the most common neurodegenerative disorders. The study uses a relapse-prevention design with the endpoint of time-to-relapse of psychosis to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of pimavanserin as a potential treatment for hallucinations and delusions of dementia-related psychosis."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The drug is being investigated or considered as a treatment for various bacterial infections and in June 2017 received approval in the USA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.

He did not fully respond to treatment with dopamine agonists. His initial prolactin level was 2,400 ng/mL (in males, normal values are <16.0 ng/mL) and never normalized. At the last assessment, his prolactin level was 21.5 ng/mL, recorded after 21 years of treatment with the dopamine agonist cabergoline at a dose as high as 4.5 mg per week. Although the prolactin level remained elevated throughout the follow-up period, the patient never presented a low testosterone level and had normal pubertal development. An MRI of the sella turcica showed that the tumor became progressively cystic and disappeared, but a normal pituitary gland was observed. The pituitary gland retained its normal functions despite a partially empty sella.DISCUSSION: Long-term treatment with high doses of cabergoline may cause cystic degeneration of a prolactinoma considered to be resistant to this treatment, but we cannot rule out the possibility that this outcome represents the natural development of the tumor.S.

It occurs more frequently in women than in men. Dopaminergic agonists are effective in the shrinkage of prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor and are preferred in some patients. However, pituitary radiotherapy may enable the long-term removal of prolactin-secreting tumor cells. Recent evidence suggests that prolactinoma is a heterogeneous disorder with complicated and multifactorial etiology and pathogenesis. Apparently, a thorough understanding of prolactinoma tumorigenesis would be important. To facilitate investigations on tumorigenesis of prolactinoma, animal models for prolactinomas have been developed. These models have expedited our progress in the recent years. Many researchers consider the F(344) rat to be the most sensitive strain of rats to estrogen (E(2))-induced prolactinoma formation. Nonetheless, E(2) treatment for 60 days also induces the formation of pituitary prolactin-secreting adenoma in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Evidently, the SD rat is also a good animal for prolactinoma investigations. Following E(2) implantation, prolactinomas developed in the eutopic adenohypophysis in situ and/or ectopic pituitary grafted under the renal capsule in SD rats. These observations favor the hypothesis that prolactinoma growth is the result of pathological changes in the adenohypophysis and/or hypothalamus. In the latter case, abnormal release of hypothalamic dopamine, GABA, or brain-gut peptides (such as cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, galanin, angiotensin, opioid peptide, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, pancreatic polypeptide, and adrenocorticotropic hormone) results in some of the pathological changes that may lead to hyperprolactinemia and/or prolactinoma development. Dysregulation of prolactin synthesis and secretion may be the result of prolactin gene modulation. In E(2)-induced rat prolactinomas, prolactin mRNA contents and the expression of some proto-oncogenes, e.g. c-myc and c-ras, TGFalpha and TGFbeta1 mRNA were significantly changed. The above findings are consistent with results in human prolactinoma development. In addition, in rats abnormal expression of the prolactin gene was correlated with hypomethylated status of CpG sites in exons 1, 2 and 4 of the prolactin gene, as well as the increase in hypersensitive sites to DNase 1 in the encoding region of the prolactin gene. In E(2)-treated rats, a point mutation with a base substitution from cytidine (C) to adenine (A) was found at the -36-bp site of the proximal promoter of the prolactin gene in eutopic pituitary prolactinomas, but no change was observed in the same sequence of the prolactin gene in ectopic prolactinoma. The association of a base substitution with the hyperexpression of the prolactin gene in eutopic prolactinomas suggests that different mechanisms may mediate the formation of eutopic and ectopic prolactin-secreting tumors. Melatonin decreases the expression of the prolactin gene in vitro suggesting that this pineal hormone may be a potential anticarcinogen in vivo. It has also been shown that MT(2) (Mel(1b)) melatonin receptors are expressed in anterior pituitary cells. The use of melatonin as a preventive or therapeutic drug for prolactinomas should be further investigated. In summary, improved knowledge on tumorigenesis of prolactinomas, especially in the rat model, was noted. These E(2)-induced rat prolactinoma models would facilitate future investigations, and expected results shall be fruitful and exciting for the development of future drug designs for the prevention and/or treatment of prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors."}]}, {"title": "list", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Genetic association studies have identified 215 risk loci for inflammatory bowel disease, thereby uncovering fundamental aspects of its molecular biology.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents a summary of the company's submission (CS), the ERG report and the development of the NICE guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the appraisal committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of T/T based upon the CS. In the CS, pooled evidence of two trials (a phase II trial and RECOURSE) showed that T/T resulted in a significant increase in overall survival [OS; hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78] and progression-free survival (PFS; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.40-0.53). The AC considered the survival benefit of T/T clinically meaningful although relatively small. The ERG highlighted that none of the participants in the phase II trial and approximately half of the RECOURSE participants (394 of 800) were from Europe, which might limit the applicability of the study findings to the NHS. Moreover, the ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns that resulted in 11 adjustments to the company's base-case analysis. The ERG adjustments that had the largest impact were using the RECOURSE trial data only (instead of the pooled evidence), fixing errors and violations and using the utilities from the CORRECT trial (identified in the literature review) only. The ERG preferred to use the RECOURSE trial data only given the suboptimal methodology used by the company to pool the evidence. However, since there were no fundamental arguments to prevent the two trials from being pooled, the ERG also presented its base-case analysis based on the pooled effectiveness estimates. The company base-case resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £44,032 per QALY gained while the ERG base-case resulted in ICERs of £52,695 and £49,392 per QALY gained based on the RECOURSE trial only and pooled evidence, respectively.

Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there was no drug-drug interaction with capecitabine. Adverse events seen at the recommended phase 2 dose regardless of causality, grade, and treatment group included diarrhoea (35 [67%] of 52 patients), nausea (31 [60%] patients), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (23 [44%] patients), fatigue (20 [38%] patients), and vomiting (20 [38%] patients).

To determine tissue-plasma concordance, we compared plasma findings to results of repeat biopsies.Results: At progression, we detected an ALK fusion in plasma from 19 (86%) of 22 patients, and identified ALK resistance mutations in plasma specimens from 11 (50%) patients.

However, clinical outcomes in these patients vary, and the benefit of TKIs is limited as a result of acquired resistance. Emerging data suggest that the ALK fusion variant may affect clinical outcome, but the molecular basis for this association is unknown. Patients and Methods We identified 129 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with known ALK variants. ALK resistance mutations and clinical outcomes on ALK TKIs were retrospectively evaluated according to ALK variant. A Foundation Medicine data set of 577 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC was also examined. Results The most frequent ALK variants were EML4-ALK variant 1 in 55 patients (43%) and variant 3 in 51 patients (40%). We analyzed 77 tumor biopsy specimens from patients with variants 1 and 3 who had progressed on an ALK TKI. ALK resistance mutations were significantly more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (57% v 30%; P = .023). In particular, ALK G1202R was more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (32% v 0%; P < .001).

In vitro, human ABCB1 and mouse Abcg2 modestly transported lorlatinib.

This hypothesis suggests a compromised oral hygiene leads to a dysbiotic oral microbiome whereby Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone periodontal pathogen, with its companion species, orchestrates immune subversion in the host. Brushing and chewing on teeth supported by already injured soft tissues leads to bacteremias. As a result, a persistent systemic inflammatory response develops to periodontal pathogens. The pathogens, and the host's inflammatory response, subsequently lead to the initiation and progression of multiple metabolic and inflammatory co-morbidities, including AD. Insufficient levels of essential micronutrients can lead to microbial dysbiosis through the growth of periodontal pathogens such as demonstrated for P. gingivalis under low hemin bioavailability. An individual's diet also defines the consortium of microbial communities that take up residency in the oral and gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiomes. Their imbalance can lead to behavioral changes. For example, probiotics enriched in Lactobacillus genus of bacteria, when ingested, exert some anti-inflammatory influence through common host/bacterial neurochemicals, both locally, and through sensory signaling back to the brain. Early life dietary behaviors may cause an imbalance in the host/microbial endocrinology through a dietary intake incompatible with a healthy GI tract microbiome later in life. This imbalance in host/microbial endocrinology may have a lasting impact on mental health.

Lurbinectedin starting dose was a 7-mg flat dose and later, 3.5 mg/m2 in arm A. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The translational substudy of resistance mechanisms included exome sequencing (n = 13) and in vivo experiments with patient-derived xenografts (n = 11) from BRCA1/2-mutated tumors.RESULTS: ORR was 41% (95% CI, 28% to 55%) in arm A and 9% (95% CI, 2% to 24%) in arm B.

However, most of the analytical methods are based on the identification of reliable peptides and not the direct identification of intact proteins. Thus, assembling peptides identified from tandem mass spectra into a list of proteins, referred to as protein inference, is a critical step in proteomics research. Currently, different protein inference algorithms and tools are available for the proteomics community. Here, we evaluated five software tools for protein inference (PIA, ProteinProphet, Fido, ProteinLP, MSBayesPro) using three popular database search engines: Mascot, X!Tandem, and MS-GF+. All the algorithms were evaluated using a highly customizable KNIME workflow using four different public datasets with varying complexities (different sample preparation, species and analytical instruments). We defined a set of quality control metrics to evaluate the performance of each combination of search engines, protein inference algorithm, and parameters on each dataset. We show that the results for complex samples vary not only regarding the actual numbers of reported protein groups but also concerning the actual composition of groups. Furthermore, the robustness of reported proteins when using databases of differing complexities is strongly dependant on the applied inference algorithm. Finally, merging the identifications of multiple search engines does not necessarily increase the number of reported proteins, but does increase the number of peptides per protein and thus can generally be recommended.SIGNIFICANCE: Protein inference is one of the major challenges in MS-based proteomics nowadays. Currently, there are a vast number of protein inference algorithms and implementations available for the proteomics community. Protein assembly impacts in the final results of the research, the quantitation values and the final claims in the research manuscript. Even though protein inference is a crucial step in proteomics data analysis, a comprehensive evaluation of the many different inference methods has never been performed. Previously Journal of proteomics has published multiple studies about other benchmark of bioinformatics algorithms (PMID: 26585461; PMID: 22728601) in proteomics studies making clear the importance of those studies for the proteomics community and the journal audience. This manuscript presents a new bioinformatics solution based on the KNIME/OpenMS platform that aims at providing a fair comparison of protein inference algorithms (https://github.com/KNIME-OMICS). Six different algorithms - ProteinProphet, MSBayesPro, ProteinLP, Fido and PIA- were evaluated using the highly customizable workflow on four public datasets with varying complexities. Five popular database search engines Mascot, X!Tandem, MS-GF+ and combinations thereof were evaluated for every protein inference tool. In total >186 proteins lists were analyzed and carefully compare using three metrics for quality assessments of the protein inference results: 1) the numbers of reported proteins, 2) peptides per protein, and the 3) number of uniquely reported proteins per inference method, to address the quality of each inference method. We also examined how many proteins were reported by choosing each combination of search engines, protein inference algorithms and parameters on each dataset. The results show that using 1) PIA or Fido seems to be a good choice when studying the results of the analyzed workflow, regarding not only the reported proteins and the high-quality identifications, but also the required runtime. 2) Merging the identifications of multiple search engines gives almost always more confident results and increases the number of peptides per protein group. 3) The usage of databases containing not only the canonical, but also known isoforms of proteins has a small impact on the number of reported proteins. The detection of specific isoforms could, concerning the question behind the study, compensate for slightly shorter reports using the parsimonious reports. 4) The current workflow can be easily extended to support new algorithms and search engine combinations.Copyright © 2016.

M7824 is a novel first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein comprising a monoclonal antibody against programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, avelumab), fused to the extracellular domain of human transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) receptor 2, which functions as a TGFβ \"trap.\" Advanced urothelial tumors have been shown to express TGFβ, which possesses immunosuppressive properties that promote cancer progression and metastasis. The rationale for a combined molecule is to block the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction between tumor cells and immune cell infiltrate and simultaneously reduce or eliminate TGFβ from the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we explored the effect of M7824 on invasive urothelial carcinoma cell lines.METHODS: Human urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma cell lines HTB-4, HTB-1, and HTB-5 were treated with M7824, M7824mut (M7824 that is mutated in the anti-PD-L1 portion of the molecule and thus does not bind PD-L1), anti-PD-L1 (avelumab), or IgG1 isotype control monoclonal antibody, and were assessed for gene expression, cell-surface phenotype, and sensitivity to lysis by TRAIL, antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells.RESULTS: M7824 retains the ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumor cells, although in some cases to a lesser extent than anti-PD-L1. However, compared to anti-PD-L1, M7824 increases (A) gene expression of molecules involved in T-cell trafficking in the tumor (e.g., CXCL11), (B) TRAIL-mediated tumor cell lysis, and (C) antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell-mediated lysis of tumor cells.CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of M7824 on both tumor cell phenotype and immune-mediated lysis. Compared to anti-PD-L1 or M7824mut, M7824 induces immunogenic modulation of urothelial carcinoma cell lines, rendering them more susceptible to immune-mediated recognition and lysis. These findings show the relevance of the dual blockade of PD-L1 and TGFβ in urothelial carcinoma cell lines and thus support the rationale for future clinical studies of M7824 in patients with urothelial cancer.Published by Elsevier Inc."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Recent prospective and retrospective studies supported the usefulness of platinum agents as a chemotherapeutic at the time of varied TACE therapy. Although balloon-occluded TACE is an effective therapy for localized HCC and drug-eluting microspheres seemed to show a higher response rate in certain HCCs, the definite advantages of those procedures still remain uncertain. Intermediate stage HCC, or Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B, is regarded as a heterogeneous category with a wide spectrum of tumors and patients, and several subclassifications of the stage have been proposed to show different prognoses; there are also different recommended therapies in each subgroup. Authors have subclassified patients based on combinations of tumor size, tumor number, and liver function, with or without performance status. Because of differences of available medical resources and techniques in treatment procedures between countries, the most ideal and useful subgrouping remains inconclusive at present. Recently, a few systemic chemotherapies proved to be effective for advanced stage HCC in phase III studies: lenvatinib as the first line of therapy, and regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab as second-line therapy.

In a prespecified subgroup analysis of HPV-positive participants, motolimod vs placebo resulted in significantly longer PFS (7.8 vs 5.9 months; HR, 0.58; 1-sided 90% CI, 0.00-0.90; P = .046) and OS (15.2 vs 12.6 months; HR, 0.41; 1-sided 90% CI, 0.00-0.77; P = .03). In an exploratory analysis, patients with injection site reactions had longer PFS and OS (median PFS, 7.1 vs 5.9 months; HR, 0.69; 1-sided 90% CI, 0.00-0.93; P = .06; and median OS, 18.7 vs 12.6; HR, 0.56; 1-sided 90% CI, 0.00-0.81; P = .02).Conclusions and Relevance: Adding motolimod to the EXTREME regimen was well tolerated but did not improve PFS or OS in the intent-to-treat population.

We sought to develop a rational combination of motolimod-a novel Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist that stimulates robust innate immune responses in humans but diminished responses in mice-with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), a chemotherapeutic that induces immunogenic cell death.Experimental Design: We followed an integrative pharmacologic approach including healthy human volunteers, non-human primates, NSG-HIS (\"humanized immune system\") mice reconstituted with human CD34+ cells, and patients with cancer to test the effects of motolimod and to assess the combination of motolimod with PLD for the treatment of ovarian cancer.Results: The pharmacodynamic effects of motolimod monotherapy in NSG-HIS mice closely mimicked those in non-human primates and healthy human subjects, whereas the effects of the motolimod/PLD combination in tumor-bearing NSG-HIS mice closely mimicked those in patients with ovarian cancer treated in a phase Ib trial (NCT01294293). The NSG-HIS mouse helped elucidate the mechanism of action of the combination and revealed a positive interaction between the two drugs in vivo The combination produced no dose-limiting toxicities in patients with ovarian cancer. Two subjects (15%) had complete responses and 7 subjects (53%) had disease stabilization. A phase II study was consequently initiated.Conclusions: These results are the first to demonstrate the value of pharmacologic approaches integrating the NSG-HIS mouse, non-human primates, and patients with cancer for the development of novel immunomodulatory anticancer agents with human specificity.

Most patients experienced adverse events of fatigue, anemia, nausea, decreased white blood cells, and constipation. In pre-specified subgroup analyses, motolimod-treated patients who experienced injection site reactions (ISR) had a lower risk of death compared with those who did not experience ISR. Additionally, pre-treatment in vitro responses of immune biomarkers to TLR8 stimulation predicted OS outcomes in patients receiving motolimod on study. Immune score (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes; TIL), TLR8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, mutational status in BRCA and other DNA repair genes, and autoantibody biomarkers did not correlate with OS or PFS.Conclusions: The addition of motolimod to PLD did not improve clinical outcomes compared with placebo. However, subset analyses identified statistically significant differences in the OS of motolimod-treated patients on the basis of ISR and in vitro immune responses.

The gold standard for acute migraine treatment are the triptans, 5-HT1B/1D/(1F) receptor agonists. Their actions are thought to be mediated through activation of: (i) 5-HT1B receptors in cranial blood vessels with subsequent cranial vasoconstriction; (ii) prejunctional 5-HT1D receptors on trigeminal fibers that inhibit trigeminal CGRP release; and (iii) 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptors in central nervous system involved in (anti)nociceptive modulation. Unfortunately, coronary arteries also express 5-HT1B receptors whose activation would produce coronary vasoconstriction; hence, triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease. In addition, since migraineurs have an increased cardiovascular risk, it is important to develop antimigraine drugs devoid of vascular (side) effects. Ditans, here defined as selective 5-HT1F receptor agonists, were developed on the basis that most of the triptans activate trigeminal 5-HT1F receptors, which may explain part of the triptans' antimigraine action. Amongst the ditans, lasmiditan: (i) fails to constrict human coronary arteries; and (ii) is effective for the acute treatment of migraine in preliminary Phase III clinical trials. Admittedly, the exact site of action is still unknown, but lasmiditan possess a high lipophilicity, which suggests a direct action on the central descending antinociceptive pathways. Furthermore, since 5-HT1F receptors are located on trigeminal fibers, they could modulate CGRP release.

The advance in the development of 5-HT1 receptor agonists for migraine, including 5-HT1B/D and 5-HT1F receptor agonists, has meant a major step forward towards the progression of a better treatment for migraine. Triptans have a limited efficacy, and their effect on vasoconstriction makes them unsafe for patients with cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, novel effective antimigraine treatments without cardiovascular effects are required, such as selective 5-HT1F receptor agonists (ditans). Lasmiditan has much higher affinity for the 5-HT1F receptor than for the vasoconstrictor 5-HT1B receptor. This has been confirmed in preclinical studies performed to date, where lasmiditan showed no effect on vasoconstriction, and in clinical trials, where healthy individuals and patients did not report cardiac events due to treatment with lasmiditan, although it should be confirmed in larger cohorts. Lasmiditan crosses the blood-brain barrier and may act both centrally and peripherally on 5-HT1F receptors expressed on trigeminal neurons. It is a well-tolerated compound that does not induce major adverse events.

The cornerstone of pharmacological treatment is represented by the acute therapy. The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptor subtype 1B/1D agonists, called triptans, are nowadays the first-line acute therapy for patients who experience moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. Unfortunately, a high percentage of patients are not satisfied with this acute treatment, either for lack of response or side effects. Moreover, their mechanism of action based on vasoconstriction makes them unsuitable for patients with previous cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases and for those with uncontrolled hypertension. Since the introduction of triptans, no other acute drug class has passed all developmental stages. The research for a new drug lacking vasoconstrictive effects led to the development of lasmiditan, a highly selective 5-HT1F receptor agonist with minimized interactions with other 5-HT receptor subtypes.

Given these changes, patients are more likely to adhere to treatment, achieve better clinical outcomes, and experience both fewer side effects and drug-drug interactions. Newer STRs include dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC)/abacavir (ABC) (Triumeq; Viiv Healthcare, Research Triangle Park, NC), rilpivirine (RPV)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) (Odefsey; Gilead, Foster City, CA), RPV/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (Complera; Gilead), elvitegravir (EVG)/cobicistat (COBI)/FTC/TDF (Stribild; Gilead), and EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF (Genvoya; Gilead).

The Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines for HIV recommend many of these integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) STRs as a preferred choice for initiation of treatment in both ART-naive and -experienced patients because they offer comparably faster rates of virologic suppression, reduced rates of resistance development (especially with DTG), and overall better adherence than protease inhibitors or NNRTIs. Numerous phase 3 clinical trials support these recommendations including several switch or simplification clinical trials. Notably, the novel pharmacokinetic booster COBI, with its water soluble properties, has enabled the development and coformulation of a few of these STRs and FDCs. Also, a newer tenofovir salt formulation, TAF, has an advantageous pharmacokinetic profile, contributing to better overall renal and bone tolerability compared with TDF. Further simplification regimens comprising dual ART therapies are currently being explored. This review provides an overview of the clinical efficacy and safety data for these coformulated agents, highlighting the relative impact on comparative adverse events, assessing the potential for experiencing fewer drug-drug interactions, and discussing the clinical implications regarding adherence to treatment."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Triumeq is a single-tablet regimen for patients with HIV infection comprising dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine.

Subjects randomly received whole-tablet TRI with fasting (reference), crushed and suspended TRI with fasting or crushed and suspended TRI with oral intake of enteral nutrition. Bioequivalence criteria (80%-125% acceptance range) of AUC0-∞ and Cmax were used. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02569346.Results: Crushing TRI leads to higher dolutegravir exposure (AUC0-∞: +26% and Cmax: +30%) and, if crushed TRI is combined with enteral nutrition, to a decrease in abacavir Cmax (-17%). Lamivudine concentrations were not affected as geometric mean ratios with 90% CIs fell within the 80%-125% range.Conclusions: Bioequivalence could not be demonstrated for a crushed and suspended tablet or a crushed and suspended tablet with oral intake of enteral nutrition compared with whole-tablet TRI with fasting. Both scenarios led to higher dolutegravir exposure, but this did not exceed exposure after intake with food or in twice-daily dosing. In our opinion, TRI can be crushed for patients with swallowing difficulties and can be simultaneously administered with enteral nutrition."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "On running short of medication, he admitted to sharing his partner's treatment (Triumeq; abacavir, lamivudine and dolutegravir).

Concerns about tofacitinib have been raised by analyses of the Federal Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERs). These show some evidence of increased risks of pulmonary thrombosis, though not pulmonary embolism or venous thrombosis.

In RA, thromboembolic risks increase to three to seven per 1000 patient years. The impact of biologics and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on disease risk appears minimal, and the number of thromboembolic events is between four and eight per 1000 patient years.

As the numbers of thromboembolic events will be small and patients enrolled in trials are not representative of all RA patients who may receive JAK inhibitors, this information is unlikely to provide definitive answers.

Previous reports suggested a dynamic modulation of the chromatin landscape during adipocyte differentiation. We thus hypothesized that PARP1 plays an important transcriptional role in adipogenesis and metabolism and therefore used adipocyte development and function as a model to elucidate the molecular action of PARP1 in obesity-related diseases. Our results show that PARP1-dependent ADP-ribose polymer (PAR) formation increases during adipocyte development and, at late time points of adipogenesis, is involved in the sustained expression of PPARγ2 and of PPARγ2 target genes. During adipogenesis, PARP1 was recruited to PPARγ2 target genes such as CD36 or aP2 in a PAR-dependent manner.

On the one hand, we uncovered a cooperative interplay between PARP1 and UHRF1 in the accumulation of the heterochromatin repressive mark H4K20me3. The absence of PARP1 led to reduced accumulation of H4K20me3 onto pericentric heterochromatin that coincided with abnormally enhanced transcription. The loss of H4K20me3 was rescued by the additional depletion of UHRF1. In contrast, although PARP1 also seemed to facilitate the association of UHRF1 with DNMT1, its absence did not impair the loading of DNMT1 onto heterochromatin or the methylation of pericentric regions, possibly owing to a compensating interaction of DNMT1 with PCNA. On the other hand, we showed that PARP1 controls the UHRF1-mediated ubiquitination of DNMT1 to timely regulate its abundance during S and G2 phase.

Our data show that expression of PARP1 and protein PARylation were increased by >2-fold and >16-fold, respectively, in the cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial fractions of the human cardiac myocytes and the myocardium of wildtype (WT) mice chronically infected with T. cruzi. The nuclear and cytosolic PARP1/PAR did not interfere with the transcription and translation of the components of the mtDNA replisome machinery in infected cardiomyocytes and chagasic murine myocardium. However, PARP1 binding to Polymerase γ and mtDNA in mitochondria were increased, and associated with a loss in mtDNA content, mtDNA-encoded gene expression, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity, and an increase in mitochondrial ROS production in cells and heart of WT mice infected with T. cruzi. Subsequently, an increase in oxidative stress, and cardiac collagen deposition, and a decline in LV function was noted in chagasic mice. Genetic deletion of PARP1 or treatment with selective inhibitor of PARP1 (PJ34) improved the mtDNA content, mitochondrial function, and oxidant/antioxidant balance in human cardiomyocytes and chronically infected mice. Further, PARP1 inhibition was beneficial in preserving the cardiac structure and left ventricular function in chagasic mice. We conclude that PARP1 overexpression is associated with a decline in Pol γ-dependent maintenance of mtDNA content, mtDNA-encoded gene expression, and mitochondrial respiratory function, and subsequently contributes to an increase in mtROS and oxidative stress in chagasic myocardium.

A preliminary report described improvements of hepatic microcirculation in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) following treatment with LOLA. Mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of LOLA in NAFLD/NASH involve, in addition to its established ammonia-lowering effect, metabolic transformations of the LOLA-constituent amino acids L-ornithine and L-aspartate into L-glutamine, L-arginine, and glutathione. These metabolites have well-established actions implicated in the prevention of lipid peroxidation, improvement of hepatic microcirculation in addition to anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. Key Messages: (1) LOLA is effective for the treatment of key indices in NAFLD/NASH. (2) Mechanisms other than LOLA's ammonia-lowering action have been postulated.

GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitors, which are currently approved for use in diabetes, have shown early efficacy in NASH, and also have beneficial cardiovascular or renal effects. Innovative NASH therapies include four main pathways. The first approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation. Medications in this approach include modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (e.g., pemafibrate, elafibranor), medications targeting farnesoid X receptor axis [obeticholic acid; OCA)], inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, ACC inhibitor), and fibroblast growth factor-21 analogues. A second target is oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This class of drug includes apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor and emricasan (an irreversible caspase inhibitor). A third target is intestinal microbiomes and metabolic endotoxemia. Several agents are in ongoing trials, including IMMe124, TLR4 antagonist, and solithromycin (macrolide antibiotics). The final target is hepatic fibrosis, which is strongly associated with all-cause or liver-related mortality in NASH. Antifibrotic agents are a cysteine-cysteine motif chemokine receptor-2/5 antagonist (cenicriviroc; CVC) and galectin 3 antagonist. Among a variety of medications in development, four agents such as OCA, elafibranor, ASK1 inhibitor, and CVC are currently being evaluated in an international phase 3 trial for the treatment of NASH.

We aimed to assess the activity and safety of pazopanib in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease.METHODS: In this non-randomised, single-centre, open-label, phase 2 trial, adult patients with clinical manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease were recruited from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) and were treated with pazopanib (800 mg orally daily) for 24 weeks, with an option to continue treatment if desired by the patient and treating physician. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response and safety in the per-protocol population. The objective response was measured for each patient and each lesion type. Radiographic assessments were done at baseline and every 12 weeks throughout the study. Activity and safety were assessed with continuous monitoring and a Bayesian design.

The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 42% (13 of 31 patients). By lesion sites responses were observed in 31 (52%) of 59 renal cell carcinomas, nine (53%) of 17 pancreatic lesions, and two (4%) of 49 CNS haemangioblastomas. Seven (23%) of 31 patients chose to stay on the treatment after 24 weeks. Four (13%) of 31 patients withdrew from the study because of grade 3 or 4 transaminitis, and three (10%) discontinued study treatment because of treatment intolerance with multiple intercurrent grade 1-2 toxicities.

A few broad perspectives are presented regarding how continued work on these elements could provide important insights into the aging process, regardless of whether their mobility is ultimately found to significantly contribute to reduced lifespan and healthspan."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "These observations indicate that the protective effect of taraxasterol against rheumatoid arthritis is mediated via the modulation of inflammatory responses in mice", "answer_start": 1126}], "question": "What is the function of Taraxasterol  in rheumatoid arthritis?", "id": "5c85171875a4a5d219000004_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Taraxasterol is an effective component of dandelion that has anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro.

Netrin-4 is a novel member of netrin family recently identified in the vertebrate with neuritis elongation promoting activity; however, the receptors for netrin-4 are still unknown. To better understand the function and signal transduction pathway of netrin-4, the potential receptors for netrin-4 were studied in this paper. The netrin-4 protein was prepared by introducing a eukaryotic expression vector with a secretable alkaline phosphatase tag (AP4) into COS7 cells to allow the expression of AP4-netrin4 fusion protein. Axon guidance activity of netrin-4 was confirmed by using the cortical explants. After incubation with cultured primary cortical neurons, the neurons were distinctly labeled by the AP4-coupled netrin-4 ligands. In contrast, the binding activity of AP4-netrin4 to neurons could be completely competed by the exogenously expressed netrin-4 protein without AP4 tag, indicating specificity of netrin-4 binding to the potential receptors. Moreover, netrin-4 could also bind to CHO cells transfected with the plasmids expressing two known receptors for netrin-1, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and UNC5 homolog 1 (UNC5H1) respectively. As there are three domains in netrin-4, we further tried to narrow down the region containing binding sites with the receptors. Interestingly, only the N-terminal domain (LNT) could bind to DCC and UNC5H1. A further ligand-receptor binding analysis showed that both the N- and the C-terminal domain (NCT) but not the EGF-like (EGFL) domain of netrin-4 could bind to the surface of cultured primary neurons, indicating the existence of novel receptors for netrin-4. After competed by netrin-4, we confirmed that the binding of AP tagged netrin-4 domains to neurons were also netrin-4 dependent. The binding activity of the N-terminal domain of netrin-4 is about 3-fold higher than that for the C-terminal domain. In summary, our data here indicated that the two known receptors for netrin-1, DCC and UNC5H1, are also receptors for netrin-4, while only LNT but not EGFL and NCT is the key domain for specific binding.

In infants, poor weight gain, massive hepatosplenomegaly, calcified adrenal glands (present about 2/3 of the time), vomiting, diarrhea and failure to thrive are indicative of Wolman disease. The clinical picture is more variable in CESD. Hepatomegaly and/or elevation of liver transaminases are almost always present. Hepatic steatosis often leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Other signs often include splenomegaly, high total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL-cholesterol. The diagnosis of LAL deficiency requires clinical experience and specialized laboratory tests. The diagnosis is based on finding deficient activity of acid lipase and/or molecular tests. Pilot screening projects using dried blood spot testing in 1) children with atypical fatty liver disease in the absence of overweight, 2) patients with dyslipidaemia and presence of hepatomegaly and/or elevated transaminases, 3) newborns/neonates with hepatomegaly and abdominal distension/failure to thrive/elevated transaminases are currently underway. Early diagnosis is particularly important for the enzyme replacement therapy. Human trials with recombinant LAL are currently ongoing, raising the prospect for specific correction of LAL deficiency in this progressive and often debilitating disorder."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In order to elucidate the underlying molecular defects in Wolman disease, we have characterized the hLAL gene in two female Wolman patients of German and Turkish origin by SSCP and DNA sequence analysis.", "answer_start": 700}], "question": "Which enzyme is deficient in Wolman disease?", "id": "5c72f6b17c78d6947100007f_020", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Human lysosomal acid lipase/cholesteryl ester hydrolase (hLAL) is essential for the intralysosomal metabolism of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles. The key role of the enzyme in intracellular lipid homeostasis is illustrated by two lysosomal storage diseases inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Wolman disease, associated with deficient hLAL activity, leads to massive intracellular substrate accumulation and is always fatal in early infancy. Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), in contrast, is characterized by very low levels of enzymic activity sufficient to allow survival of the affected patients into adulthood. In order to elucidate the underlying molecular defects in Wolman disease, we have characterized the hLAL gene in two female Wolman patients of German and Turkish origin by SSCP and DNA sequence analysis. Our results demonstrate that the German proband was compound heterozygous for an 8-bp deletion in exon 3 and a 2-bp deletion in exon 4 of the hLAL gene. These frameshift mutations lead to protein truncation at amino acid positions 24 and 116 and to complete loss of hydrolytic activity. The Turkish proband, in contrast, was homozygous for a G(1064)-->T substitution in exon 10 of the hLAL gene which converts the completely conserved glycine (GGG) residue at position 321 of the mature enzyme to tryptophan (TGG). In vitro expression of the hLAL(Gly(321)-->Trp) cDNA construct revealed that the amino acid replacement results in a more than 99% reduction of neutral lipid hydrolysis. The mutations provide new insights into the molecular basis of Wolman disease which is apparently more heterogeneous at the genetic level than cholesteryl ester storage disease.-Lohse, P., S.

We examined the role of Mov10 in Xenopus laevis development and show a critical role for Mov10 in gastrulation and in the development of the central nervous system (CNS).RESULTS: Knockdown of maternal Mov10 in Xenopus embryos using a translation blocking morpholino led to defects in gastrulation and the development of notochord and paraxial mesoderm, and a failure to neurulate. RNA sequencing of the Mov10 knockdown embryos showed significant upregulation of many mRNAs when compared with controls at stage 10.5 (including those related to the cytoskeleton, adhesion, and extracellular matrix, which are involved in those morphogenetic processes). Additionally, the degradation of the miR-427 target mRNA, cyclin A1, was delayed in the Mov10 knockdowns. These defects suggest that Mov10's role in miRNA-mediated regulation of the maternal to zygotic transition could lead to pleiotropic effects that cause the gastrulation defects. Additionally, the knockdown of zygotic Mov10 showed that it was necessary for normal head, eye, and brain development in Xenopus consistent with a recent study in the mouse.CONCLUSIONS: Mov10 is essential for gastrulation and normal CNS development.

Treatments for hepatitis C virus infection have reduced non-cancer events among patients receiving liver transplants, so reducing HCC-related death might be an actionable end point. We performed a competing-risk analysis to evaluate factors associated with survival of patients with HCC and developed a prognostic model based on features of HCC patients before liver transplantation.METHODS: We performed multivariable competing-risk regression analysis to identify factors associated with HCC-specific death of patients who underwent liver transplantation. The training set comprised 1018 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC from January 2000 through December 2013 at 3 tertiary centers in Italy. The validation set comprised 341 consecutive patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC during the same period at the Liver Cancer Institute in Shanghai, China. We collected pretransplantation data on etiology of liver disease, number and size of tumors, patient level of α-fetoprotein (AFP), model for end-stage liver disease score, tumor stage, numbers and types of treatment, response to treatments, tumor grade, microvascular invasion, dates, and causes of death. Death was defined as HCC-specific when related to HCC recurrence after transplantation, disseminated extra- and/or intrahepatic tumor relapse and worsened liver function in presence of tumor spread. The cumulative incidence of death was segregated for hepatitis C virus status.RESULTS: In the competing-risk regression, the sum of tumor number and size and of log10 level of AFP were significantly associated with HCC-specific death (P < .001), returning an average c-statistic of 0.780 (95% confidence interval, 0.763-0.798). Five-year cumulative incidence of non-HCC-related death was 8.6% in HCV-negative patients and 18.1% in HCV-positive patients. For patients with HCC to have a 70% chance of HCC-specific survival 5 years after transplantation, their level of AFP should be <200 ng/mL and the sum of number and size of tumors (in centimeters) should not exceed 7; if the level of AFP was 200-400 ng/mL, the sum of the number and size of tumors should be ≤5; if their level of AFP was 400-1000 ng/mL, the sum of the number and size of tumors should be ≤4. In the validation set, the model identified patients who survived 5 years after liver transplantation with 0.721 accuracy (95% confidence interval, 0.648%-0.793%). Our model, based on patients' level of AFP and HCC number and size, outperformed the Milan; University of California, San Francisco; Shanghai-Fudan; Up-to-7 criteria (P < .001); and AFP French model (P = .044) to predict which patients will survive for 5 years after liver transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a model based on level of AFP, tumor size, and tumor number, to determine risk of death from HCC-related factors after liver transplantation.

In contrast to microdeletions in 17p13.3, recent studies have attracted considerable attention to a condition known as a 17p13.3 microduplication syndrome. Depending on the genes involved in their microduplication, patients with 17p13.3 microduplication syndrome may be categorized into either class I or class II. Individuals in class I have microduplications of the YWHAE gene encoding 14-3-3ε, as well as other genes in the region. However, the PAFAH1B1 gene encoding LIS1 is never duplicated in these patients. Class I microduplications generally result in learning disabilities, autism, and developmental delays, among other disorders. Individuals in class II always have microduplications of the PAFAH1B1 gene, which may include YWHAE and other genetic microduplications. Class II microduplications generally result in smaller body size, developmental delays, microcephaly, and other brain malformations. Here, we review the phenotypes associated with copy number variations (CNVs) of chromosome 17p13.3 and detail their developmental connection to particular microdeletions or microduplications. We also focus on existing single and double knockout mouse models that have been used to study human phenotypes, since the highly limited number of patients makes a study of these conditions difficult in humans. These models are also crucial for the study of brain development at a mechanistic level since this cannot be accomplished in humans. Finally, we emphasize the usefulness of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and next generation sequencing in the study of neurodevelopmental diseases."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We report a fetus with lissencephaly diagnosed as Miller-Dieker Syndrome postnatally.

One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was impossible to establish.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of TAS. Our cases share many clinical features of TAS and underline the variability in this syndrome, as well as the need for thorough investigation following a multidisciplinary approach. What is known: • Triple A syndrome is characterised by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, neurological impairment, and dermatological abnormalities. • A precise genotype-phenotype correlation has proved impossible to establish. What is new: • These cases add to a large number of similar case reports with limited novel information. • The newly identified AAAS gene mutation was reported."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Background Triple A syndrome is characterized by achalasia, alacrima and adrenal insufficiency with neurological manifestations occurring later in the course of the disease.

It occurs due to biallelic mutations in the AAAS gene which codes for the nuclear pore protein ALADIN. A number of other features have been reported over time in this heterogeneous and multisystemic disorder. Unlike other autosomal recessive disorders, triple A syndrome patients show a wide phenotypic variability both among different patients and family members harboring the same mutation(s). A gene-environment interaction has been thought to be a plausible cause. Methods A retrospective analysis of six families and seven patients presenting with triple A syndrome was carried out. The clinical, biochemical and molecular testing data were collected and correlated. The results of treatment and follow-up and genetic counseling of the families were obtained wherever feasible. Results Our cohort consisted mostly of children and displayed a wide phenotypic variability in the presenting symptoms ranging from hypoglycemic seizures at the severe end of the spectrum to insidious hyperpigmentation and delayed development. Neurological and autonomic features were present in a few patients, suggesting requirement of prolonged follow-up for these patients. A significant gap between the onset of symptoms and confirmatory diagnosis was noted, suggesting that a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing this disorder. Sudden unexplained death was observed in siblings, and early diagnosis and treatment could help in preventing early mortality and improving the quality of life for these patients.

Initially, we showed that autophosphorylated PKD1 and PKD2 (activated PKD1/2) are significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer and that PKD1/2 are expressed in multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines. Using Panc-1 as a model system, we showed that CRT0066101 reduced bromodeoxyuridine incorporation; increased apoptosis; blocked neurotensin-induced PKD1/2 activation; reduced neurotensin-induced, PKD-mediated Hsp27 phosphorylation; attenuated PKD1-mediated NF-kappaB activation; and abrogated the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent proliferative and prosurvival proteins. We showed that CRT0066101 given orally (80 mg/kg/d) for 24 days significantly abrogated pancreatic cancer growth in Panc-1 subcutaneous xenograft model. Activated PKD1/2 expression in the treated tumor explants was significantly inhibited with peak tumor concentration (12 micromol/L) of CRT0066101 achieved within 2 hours after oral administration. Further, we showed that CRT0066101 given orally (80 mg/kg/d) for 21 days in Panc-1 orthotopic model potently blocked tumor growth in vivo. CRT0066101 significantly reduced Ki-67-positive proliferation index (P < 0.01), increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive apoptotic cells (P < 0.05), and abrogated the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent proteins including cyclin D1, survivin, and cIAP-1.

Using progression tissue microarrays, we here demonstrate that the serine/threonine kinase protein kinase D3 (PKD3) is highly upregulated in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (ER(-)) tumors. We identify direct binding of the ER to the PRKD3 gene promoter as a mechanism of inhibition of PKD3 expression. Loss of ER results in upregulation of PKD3, leading to all hallmarks of aggressive IDC, including increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This identifies ER(-) breast cancers as ideal for treatment with the PKD inhibitor CRT0066101. We show that similar to a knockdown of PKD3, treatment with this inhibitor targets all tumorigenic processes in vitro and decreases growth of primary tumors and metastasis in vivo.

Inhibition of PKD resulted in significantly attenuation of NF-κB activation in both in vitro and in vivo models of experimental pancreatitis.

Furthermore, PKD inhibitor CID755673, given after the initiation of pancreatitis in experimental rat model, significantly attenuated the severity of acute pancreatitis.

Diacylglycerol (DAG), which is also increased in muscle exposed to high glucose, activates a number of signaling molecules including protein kinase (PK)C and PKD1. We sought to determine whether PKC or PKD1 is involved in inhibition of AMPK by causing Ser(485/491) phosphorylation in skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 myotubes were treated with the PKC/D1 activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which acts as a DAG mimetic. This caused dose- and time-dependent increases in AMPK Ser(485/491) phosphorylation, which was associated with a ∼60% decrease in AMPKα2 activity. Expression of a phosphodefective AMPKα2 mutant (S491A) prevented the PMA-induced reduction in AMPK activity. Serine phosphorylation and inhibition of AMPK activity were partially prevented by the broad PKC inhibitor Gö6983 and fully prevented by the specific PKD1 inhibitor CRT0066101. Genetic knockdown of PKD1 also prevented Ser(485/491) phosphorylation of AMPK. Inhibition of previously identified kinases that phosphorylate AMPK at this site (Akt, S6K, and ERK) did not prevent these events. PMA treatment also caused impairments in insulin-signaling through Akt, which were prevented by PKD1 inhibition. Finally, recombinant PKD1 phosphorylated AMPKα2 at Ser(491) in cell-free conditions.

Using these cells, we found that CL was not required for either tBID-induced BAX activation, or for apoptosis in response to treatment with TRAIL.

Primary endpoint was change in monthly migraine days. Secondary endpoints were ≥50% reduction in monthly migraine days, change in acute migraine-specific medication treatment days, and ≥5-point reduction in Physical Impairment and Impact on Everyday Activities domain scores measured by the Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary. All endpoints assessed change from baseline at month 3. Results Patients receiving erenumab experienced -2.9 days change in monthly migraine days, compared with -1.8 days for placebo, least-squares mean (95% CI) treatment difference of -1.0 (-1.6, -0.5) ( p < 0.001).

The mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function through regulating the mitochondrial acetylome. It is interesting to note that unique cardiac and systemic microRNAs have been shown to play an important role in cardiac remodeling by modulating key signaling elements in the myocardium.METHODS: Cellular signaling was analyzed in human cardiomyocyte-like AC16 cells, and acetylation levels in rodent models of SIRT3-/-and transgenic microRNA-195 (miR-195) overexpression were compared with wild type. Luciferase assays, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation assays, and echocardiographic analysis were performed. Enzymatic activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP synthase were measured.RESULTS: In failing human myocardium, we observed induction of miR-195 along with decreased expression of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 that was associated with increased global protein acetylation. We further investigated the role of miR-195 in SIRT3-mediated metabolic processes and its impact on regulating enzymes involved in deacetylation. Proteomic analysis of the total acetylome showed increased overall acetylation, and specific lysine acetylation of 2 central mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, PDH and ATP synthase, as well. miR-195 downregulates SIRT3 expression through direct 3'-untranslated region targeting. Treatments with either sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, small interfering RNA-mediated SIRT3 knockdown or miR-195 overexpression enhanced acetylation of PDH complex and ATP synthase. This effect diminished PDH and ATP synthase activity and impaired mitochondrial respiration.SIRT3-/- and miR-195 transgenic mice consistently showed enhanced global protein acetylation, including PDH complex and ATP synthase, associated with decreased enzymatic activity.CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data suggest that increased levels of miR-195 in failing myocardium regulate a novel pathway that involves direct SIRT3 suppression and enzymatic inhibition via increased acetylation of PDH and ATP synthase that are essential for cardiac energy metabolism.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " pan-sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM)", "answer_start": 352}], "question": "List sirtuin inhibitors.", "id": "5c8d00980101eac870000006_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The evolutionarily-conserved sirtuin family of histone deacetylases regulates a multitude of DNA-associated processes. A recent genome-wide screen conducted in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified Yku70/80, which regulate nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and telomere structure, as being essential for cell proliferation in the presence of the pan-sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM). Here, we show that sirtuin-dependent deacetylation of both histone H3 lysine 56 and H4 lysine 16 promotes growth of yku70Δ and yku80Δ cells, and that the NAM sensitivity of these mutants is not caused by defects in DNA double-strand break repair by NHEJ, but rather by their inability to maintain normal telomere length. Indeed, our results indicate that in the absence of sirtuin activity, cells with abnormally short telomeres, e.g., yku70/80Δ or est1/2Δ mutants, present striking defects in S phase progression. Our data further suggest that early firing of replication origins at short telomeres compromises the cellular response to NAM- and genotoxin-induced replicative stress. Finally, we show that reducing H4K16ac in yku70Δ cells limits activation of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Rad53 in response to replicative stress, which promotes usage of translesion synthesis and S phase progression.

Accurate measurement of acetylation stoichiometry on a proteome-wide scale remains challenging. Most methods employ a comparison of chemically acetylated peptides to native acetylated peptides, however, the potentially large differences in abundance between these peptides presents a challenge for accurate quantification. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the most widely used quantitative proteomic methods. Here we show that serial dilution of SILAC-labeled peptides (SD-SILAC) can be used to identify accurately quantified peptides and to estimate the quantification error rate. We applied SD-SILAC to determine absolute acetylation stoichiometry in exponentially-growing and stationary-phase wild-type and Sirtuin deacetylase CobB-deficient cells. To further analyze CobB-regulated sites under conditions of globally increased or decreased acetylation, we measured stoichiometry in phophotransacetylase (ptaΔ) and acetate kinase (ackAΔ) mutant strains in the presence and absence of the Sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide. We measured acetylation stoichiometry at 3,669 unique sites and found that the vast majority of acetylation occurred at a low stoichiometry. Manipulations that cause increased nonenzymatic acetylation by acetyl-phosphate (AcP), such as stationary-phase arrest and deletion of ackA, resulted in globally increased acetylation stoichiometry. Comparison to relative quantification under the same conditions validated our stoichiometry estimates at hundreds of sites, demonstrating the accuracy of our method. Similar to Sirtuin deacetylase 3 (SIRT3) in mitochondria, CobB suppressed acetylation to lower than median stoichiometry in WT, ptaΔ, and ackAΔ cells. Together, our results provide a detailed view of acetylation stoichiometry in E. coli and suggest an evolutionarily conserved function of Sirtuin deacetylases in suppressing low stoichiometry acetylation."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Facing a growing workload and dwindling resources, the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) created the Indexing Initiative project in 1996.

To address the potential challenges highlighted above, data will be collected by a single investigator site at Ospedale San Raffaele (OSR), Milan, Italy, and entered into the registry via a central electronic platform.

This paper describes the development and initial reliability and validity of data obtained using the CHISPA instrument.METHODS: In 2015, 99 high school-aged SBHC users in Albuquerque, New Mexico, completed the CRAFFT and CHISPA twice over 2 weeks using standard test-retest methods. Using the CHISPA, students reported for the prior 3 months substances used, frequency of use, and signs of addiction or acute danger (adverse events).RESULTS: Retest reliability for the CRAFFT score was 0.82. CHISPA retest reliabilities were 0.75 for alcohol use; 0.91 for having used any substances; 0.92 for number of substances used; 0.81 for frequency of substance use; and 0.79 for number of adverse events. CRAFFT scores correlated with CHISPA measures of number of substances used at 0.62; with frequency of substance use at 0.58; and with number of adverse events at 0.64.CONCLUSIONS: CHISPA measures show preliminary evidence of reliability and validity. SBHC providers and other providers in primary care settings who use the CRAFFT screen may benefit from using the CHISPA to define recent substance use experience to guide brief interventions for adolescents with substance use concerns. The CHISPA instrument is currently being tested in electronic form in selected SBHCs in the state of New Mexico."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We present the results of the reliability and concurrent validity of the CRAFFT (acronym for Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, and Trouble) substance abuse screening instrument among residents of youth correctional facilities in Lagos, Nigeria.

An affirmative answer was scored as 1, and a negative answer, as 0. An individual was considered to have an increased risk of problematic use, abuse and dependence if he/she scored >2 in the CRAFFTa and POSITsua tests.RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-six adolescents were included; 52% were female; mean age: 16.6 years old. The CRAFFTa score was >2 for 29%, while the POSIT score was >2 for 37%. CRAFFTa sensitivity: 59%; specificity: 88%. CRAFFTa positive predictive value: 0.74; negative predictive value: 0.78.

The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), its short form AUDIT-C, the Substance Module of the Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT), and CRAFFT (acronym for car, relax, alone, forget, family, and friends).METHODS: The questionnaires were filled in by 9th and 10th graders from two comprehensive schools. All students received an interview using the alcohol section of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence according to DSM-IV as well as episodic heavy drinking served as criteria to validate the screening instruments.RESULTS: All 9th and 10th graders (n=225) of both schools participated. No significant differences were found for areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranging from 0.810 to 0.872. Cronbach's alpha was satisfactory (0.77-0.80) but poor for CRAFFT (0.64).

Alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera®) is the first gene therapy to receive Marketing Authorization in the European Union; GENIALL (GENetherapy In the MAnagement of Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency), a 15-year registry focusing on LPLD was launched in 2014 as part of its Risk Management Plan. The aim of this publication is to introduce the GENIALL Registry within a structured literature review of registries in rare genetic lipid disorders. A total of 11 relevant initiatives/registries were identified (homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) [n = 5]; LPLD [n = 1]; Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency [LALD, n = 1], detection of mutations in genetic lipid disorders [n = 4]). Besides one product registry in hoFH and the LALD registry, all other initiatives are local or country-specific. GENIALL is the first global prospective registry in LPLD that will collect physician and patient generated data on the natural course of LPLD, as well as long-term outcomes of gene therapy.CONCLUSION: There is a limited number of international initiatives focusing on the natural course of specific rare genetic lipid disorders.

We compared AQUIOS CL to a dual-platform analysis and evaluated analytical performance.METHODS: We evaluated precision, sample stability, inter-sample carryover, linearity and interpanel consistency. AQUIOS CL was compared to a dual-platform method (Sysmex XE-5000 and BD FACSCanto-II). A total of 113 patient samples were included: 45 from posttransplant patients, 44 from children and 24 random routine samples. The degree of automation was scored through the need of manual revisions triggered by AQUIOS CL run notifications and run flags.RESULTS: Intrarun and interrun variability was <9.1% with dedicated control material and <32.1% with patient samples. Relative values of lymphocyte subsets could be determined up to 48 h after venipuncture when the sample was kept at room temperature. There was no carryover and good linearity. Interpanel consistency was 3.3% for relative values and 9.4% for absolute values. Method comparison showed good analytical correlation between AQUIOS CL and a dual-platform method. Thirty-five percent of the samples triggered a run notification.

The frequency of Th17 cells increased from 3.98% ± 2.40% before treatment to 5.53% ±3.27% 24 h after treatment. Eight of 30 patients had a tumor recurrence. The results of logistic regression suggested that among 11 candidates, only the level of Th17 cells was the risk factor of tumor recurrence.

Intracellular Ca2+ signaling is triggered by activation of diverse emetic receptors (including tachykininergic NK1, serotonergic 5-HT3, dopaminergic D2, cholinergic M1, or histaminergic H1), whose activation in vomit-competent species can evoke emesis. Other emetogens such as cisplatin, rotavirus NSP4 protein and bacterial toxins can also induce intracellular Ca2+ elevation. Netupitant is a highly selective neurokinin NK1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist and palonosetron is a selective second-generation serotonin 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R) antagonist with a distinct pharmacological profile.

Cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonists possess broad-spectrum antiemetic activity since they prevent vomiting caused by a variety of emetic stimuli including the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, 5-HT3R agonists, and D2R agonists. Our findings demonstrate that application of the L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) agonist FPL 64176 and the intracellular Ca2+ mobilizing agent thapsigargin (a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor) cause vomiting in the least shrew. On the other hand, blockade of LTCCs by corresponding antagonists (nifedipine or amlodipine) not only provide broad-spectrum antiemetic efficacy against diverse agents that specifically activate emetogenic receptors such as 5-HT3, NK1, D2, and M1 receptors, but can also potentiate the antiemetic efficacy of palonosetron against the non-specific emetogen, cisplatin. In this review, we will provide an overview of Ca2+ involvement in the emetic process; discuss the relationship between Ca2+ signaling and the prevailing therapeutics in control of vomiting; highlight the evidence for Ca2+-signaling blockers/inhibitors in suppressing emetic behavior in the least shrew model of emesis as well as in the clinical setting; and also draw attention to the clinical benefits of Ca2+-signaling blockers/inhibitors in the treatment of nausea and vomiting."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "An oral fixed combination of netupitant/palonosetron (NEPA; Akynzeo(®)) is available for use in the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "List two drugs that are included in the Akynzeo pill?", "id": "5c73ad057c78d6947100008f_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "An oral fixed combination of netupitant/palonosetron (NEPA; Akynzeo(®)) is available for use in the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).

Therefore, inhibiting Bcl-2 function may enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells. Tetrocarcin A (TC-A) and bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides exhibit antitumor activity by inhibiting Bcl-2 function and transcription, respectively. We investigated whether these antitumor agents would enhance the cytotoxic effects of radiation in tumor cells overexpressing Bcl-2.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used HeLa/bcl-2 cells, a stable Bcl-2-expressing cell line derived from wild-type HeLa (HeLa/wt) cells. Cells were incubated with TC-A and bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides for 24 h after irradiation, and cell viability was then determined. Apoptotic cells were quantified by flow cytometric assay.RESULTS: The HeLa/bcl-2 cells were more resistant to radiation than HeLa/wt cells. At concentrations that are not inherently cytotoxic, both TC-A and bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides increased the cytotoxic effects of radiation in HeLa/bcl-2 cells, but not in HeLa/wt cells. However, in HeLa/bcl-2 cells, additional treatment with TC-A in combination with radiation did not significantly increase apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that TC-A and bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides reduce radioresistance of tumor cells overexpressing Bcl-2.

Studies in animals lacking specific complement proteins have confirmed that MAC formation is required to induce experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG) and NMJ damage. Complement inhibition in EAMG models can prevent disease induction and reverse its progression. Patients with anti-AChR+ MG have autoantibodies and MACs present at NMJs. Damaged NMJs are associated with more severe disease, fewer AChRs, and MACs in synaptic debris. Current MG therapies do not target complement directly. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits cleavage of complement protein C5, preventing MAC formation. Eculizumab treatment improved symptoms compared with placebo in a phase II study in patients with refractory gMG. Direct complement inhibition could preserve NMJ physiology and muscle function in patients with anti-AChR+ gMG."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The humanized monoclonal antibody eculizumab (Soliris®) is a complement inhibitor indicated for use in anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in the USA, refractory gMG in the EU, or gMG with symptoms that are difficult to control with high-dose IVIg therapy or PLEX in Japan.

Diff) induced disease, including when such tests should be done in children and how they should be interpreted.RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple tests are available for detecting disease due to C. diff. These include colonoscopy and stool analysis. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the most sensitive test for detecting the presence of colitis. The toxins produced by the C. diff. (toxin A, toxin B, and binary toxin) are the agents that cause injury and disease. Only toxin producing C. diff. Strains will cause disease. Binary toxin by itself is not thought to produce disease. Binary toxin causes disease in humans when present with toxin A and B producing bacteria, and has been implicated with fulminant life threatening disease. Stool analyses vary in sensitivity and specificity depending on the assay used. The presence of toxin producing strains of C diff. in the stool does not equate with disease. The presence of a toxin-producing bacteria or toxins (A or B) only equates with disease if diarrhea or a diseased colon (toxic megacolon, ileus, and sepsis) is present. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), when used in the stool from patients with diarrhea, appears to be the most efficient study to detect the gene that encodes for toxin A and B and thus to diagnose C. diff.-induced disease.

Diff) induced disease, including when such tests should be done in children and how they should be interpreted.RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple tests are available for detecting disease due to C. diff. These include colonoscopy and stool analysis. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the most sensitive test for detecting the presence of colitis. The toxins produced by the C. diff. (toxin A, toxin B, and binary toxin) are the agents that cause injury and disease. Only toxin producing C. diff. Strains will cause disease. Binary toxin by itself is not thought to produce disease. Binary toxin causes disease in humans when present with toxin A and B producing bacteria, and has been implicated with fulminant life threatening disease. Stool analyses vary in sensitivity and specificity depending on the assay used. The presence of toxin producing strains of C diff. in the stool does not equate with disease. The presence of a toxin-producing bacteria or toxins (A or B) only equates with disease if diarrhea or a diseased colon (toxic megacolon, ileus, and sepsis) is present. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), when used in the stool from patients with diarrhea, appears to be the most efficient study to detect the gene that encodes for toxin A and B and thus to diagnose C. diff.-induced disease.

We have previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain, preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques, we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189 and 2410-2437. Actoxumab binding caused the aggregation of TcdA especially at higher antibody:toxin concentration ratios. Actoxumab prevented the association of TcdA with target cells demonstrating that actoxumab neutralizes toxin activity by inhibiting the first step of the intoxication cascade. This mechanism of neutralization is similar to that observed with bezlotoxumab and TcdB. Comparisons of the putative TcdA epitope sequences across several C. difficile ribotypes and homologous repeat sequences within TcdA suggest a structural basis for observed differences in actoxumab binding and/or neutralization potency.

Our stably transfected cells secreted significant amounts of vaspin which was in the physiological range of ∼0.5 ng/ml in cell supernatants. Adipocyte differentiation was not affected by vaspin as expression of adipogenic marker genes as well as lipid accumulation after full differentiation was similar to control cells.

Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with exogenous vaspin resulted in reduced cytokine-induced activation of the intracellular and pro-inflammatory NFκB signaling cascades (IKKα/β, IκB and NFκB). Moreover, endogenous vaspin positively affected insulin signaling by increasing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the key mediator protein kinase B (AKT).

H9C2 cells were treated with TNF-α with or without vaspin in vitro. Tumor necrosis factor-α treatment inhibited autophagy and promoted apoptosis in H9C2 cells after stimulating for 24 hours. Pretreatment with vaspin significantly mitigated apoptosis induced by TNF-α partly because of augment effects of vaspin on autophagy as demonstrated by a higher ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, higher expression of Beclin-1, and increased autophagosomes formation. Furthermore, the AKT agonist IGF-1 significantly reversed the effect of vaspin on autophagy.

In DCM rats, upregulation of vaspin reversed cardiac dysfunction, as identified by increased left ventricular ejection fractions and fractional shortening levels, a higher Em/Am ratio, and lower levels of TNF-α, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase-myocardial isoenzyme.

Areas covered: This review covers drug chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of solriamfetol. Results of three Phase 3 trials, Treatment of OSA and Narcolepsy Excessive Sleepiness (TONES 3, 4, 5), relevant to OSA patients are summarized.

Expert commentary: Solriamfetol shows promise as adjunctive therapy in OSA. It is well tolerated and effective in reducing sleepiness and is an alternative to modafinil or armodafinil. Unlike stimulants like methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine, it does not have cardiac effects, rebound hypersomnia, or withdrawal effects."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Moreover, the wake-promoting effects of solriamfetol are probably owing to activity at DA and NE transporters rather than other neurotransmitter systems, such as histamine or orexin.", "answer_start": 1179}], "question": "What is the mechanism of action of Solriamfetol?", "id": "5c73ad097c78d69471000092_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Excessive sleepiness (ES) is associated with several sleep disorders, including narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Panx1 and Panx2 intermixing can regulate channel properties, and both pannexins have been implicated in neuronal cell death after ischemia. Our objectives were to validate the predicted N-glycosylation site of Panx2 and to study the effects of Panx2 glycosylation on localization and its capacity to interact with Panx1. We used site-directed mutagenesis, enzymatic de-glycosylation, cell-surface biotinylation, co-immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy. Our results showed that N86 is the only N-glycosylation site of Panx2. Panx2 and the N86Q mutant are predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cis-Golgi matrix with limited cell surface localization was seen only in the presence of Panx1. The Panx2 N86Q mutant is glycosylation-deficient and tends to aggregate in the ER reducing its cell surface trafficking but it can still interact with Panx1. Our study indicates that N-glycosylation may be important for folding and trafficking of Panx2.

We therefore determine the subcellular localization of Panx1 channels in cultured cells and aim at the identification of channel morphology in vitro. Using freeze-fracture replica immunolabeling on EYFP-Panx1-overexpressing HEK 293 cells, large particles were identified in plasma membranes, which were immunogold-labeled using either GFP or Panx1 antibodies. There was no labeling or particles in the nuclear membranes of these cells, pointing to plasma membrane localization of Panx1-EYFP channels. The assembly of particles was irregular, this being in contrast to the regular pattern of gap junctions. The fact that no counterparts were identified on apposing cells, which would have been indicative of intercellular signaling, supported the idea of Panx1 channels within one membrane. Control cells (transfected with EYFP only, non-transfected) were devoid of both particles and immunogold labeling. Altogether, this study provides the first demonstration of Panx1 channel morphology and assembly in intact cells. The identification of Panx1 channels as large particles within the plasma membrane provides the knowledge required to enable recognition of Panx1 channels in tissues in future studies.

In this study, we characterized novel commercial monoclonal antibodies and surveyed Panx2 expression and distribution at the mRNA and protein level by real-time qPCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Panx2 protein levels were readily detected in every tissue examined, even when transcriptional analysis predicted very low Panx2 protein expression. Furthermore, our results indicate that Panx2 transcriptional activity is a poor predictor of Panx2 protein abundance and does not correlate with Panx2 protein levels. Despite showing disproportionately high transcript levels, the CNS expressed less Panx2 protein than any other tissues analyzed. Additionally, we showed that Panx2 protein does not localize at the plasma membrane like other gap junction proteins but remains confined within cytoplasmic compartments.

This study used two rodent paradigms to investigate the action of the dopamine D3-preferring D3/D2 receptor partial agonist cariprazine. In adult male rats, cariprazine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg i.p.), and the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole (1-3 mg/kg i.p.) caused dose-dependent reversal of a delay-induced impairment in novel object recognition (NOR). Treating neonatal rat pups with phencyclidine (PCP) and subsequent social isolation produced a syndrome of behavioural alterations in adulthood including hyperactivity in a novel arena, deficits in NOR and fear motivated learning and memory, and a reduction and change in pattern of social interaction accompanied by increased ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs). Acute administration of cariprazine (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and aripiprazole (3 mg/kg) to resultant adult rats reduced neonatal PCP-social isolation induced locomotor hyperactivity and reversed NOR deficits. Cariprazine (0.3 mg/kg) caused a limited reversal of the social interaction deficit but neither drug affected the change in USVs or the deficit in fear motivated learning and memory. Results suggest that in the behavioural tests investigated cariprazine is at least as effective as aripiprazole and in some paradigms it showed additional beneficial features further supporting the advantage of combined dopamine D3/D2 receptor targeting.

The study objective was to determine whether cariprazine leads to functional alterations of monoamine systems in vivo via electrophysiological recordings from anesthetized rats. Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), locus coeruleus (LC), and hippocampus pyramidal neurons were recorded, and cariprazine was administered systemically or locally through iontophoresis. In the DRN, cariprazine completely inhibited the firing activity of 5-HT neurons, which was fully reversed by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY100635. In the LC, cariprazine reversed the inhibitory effect of the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, on norepinephrine (NE) neurons (ED50 = 66 µg/kg) but did not block the inhibitory effect of the α 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, clonidine. Cariprazine, iontophorized into the hippocampus, diminished pyramidal neuronal firing through activation of 5-HT1A receptors, while its concomitant administration did not dampen the suppressant effect of 5-HT. These results indicate that, in vivo, cariprazine acted as a 5-HT1A autoreceptor agonist in the DRN, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist in modulating the firing activity of LC NE neurons, and a full agonist at 5-HT1A receptors mediating the electrophysiological effect of 5-HT on pyramidal neurons.

At the D3 receptor, aripiprazole exhibits a slow monophasic dissociation, while cariprazine displays a rapid biphasic behaviour. Functional ß-arrestin assays and molecular dynamics simulations at the D3 receptor confirm a biphasic binding behaviour of cariprazine. This may influence its in vivo action, as the partial agonist could react rapidly to variations in the dopamine levels of schizophrenic patients and the ligand will not quantitatively dissociate from the receptor in one single step.

A similar trend in LTF protein expression was observed by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway intermediates p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun were highly expressed in GC tissue samples, and indicated that LTF downregulation may be associated with the dysregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway in GC tissues. In addition, the present study indicated that LTF overexpression reduced the expression of p38, JNK2 and c-Jun in the GC cell line, SGC7901. The present study demonstrates that LTF expression is downregulated in GC tissues and that LTF may serve an important role in the dysregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Lactotransferrin (LTF) is a pleiotropic protein, expressed in various body tissues and fluids, which modulates the host immune-inflammatory response and bone metabolism, and might be involved in dental implant osseointegration", "answer_start": 224}], "question": "List the functions of the protein lactotransferrin.", "id": "5c8bfe25d558e5f23200000f_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Dental implants have been widely used to replace missing teeth, accomplishing aesthetics and function. Due to its large use worldwide, the small percentage of implant loss becomes significant in number of cases. Lactotransferrin (LTF) is a pleiotropic protein, expressed in various body tissues and fluids, which modulates the host immune-inflammatory response and bone metabolism, and might be involved in dental implant osseointegration. Recently, a few studies have been investigating genetic aspects underlying dental implant failure.PURPOSE: This case-control study aimed to investigate the association of genetic markers (tag SNPs) in LTF gene and clinical parameters with dental implant loss.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 278 patients, both sexes, mean age 51 years old, divided into 184 without and 94 with implant loss, were genotyped for sixteen tag SNPs, representative of the whole LTF gene. Also, clinical oral and systemic parameters were analyzed. Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression model were used to analyze the results (p < .05).RESULTS: No association was found between the tag SNPs and implant loss in the study population. Clinical association was found with medical treatment, hormonal reposition, edentulism, number of placed implants, plaque, calculus, and mobility.CONCLUSION: Clinical variables, but not LTF gene polymorphisms, were associated with implant loss.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "CONCLUSIONS: Axitinib/gemcitabine, while tolerated, did not provide survival benefit over gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer from Japan or other regions.", "answer_start": 1673}], "question": "Does Axitinib prolong survival of Pancreatic Cancer patients?", "id": "5c73ad347c78d69471000098_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "OBJECTIVE: Axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3.

However, whether ASD independently increases the risk of attempted suicide regardless of depression has not been determined.METHODS: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 5,618 adolescents aged 12-17 years and young adults aged 18-29 years with ASD (ICD-9-CM code: 299) and 22,472 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled between 2001 and 2009 and followed to the end of 2011. Any suicide attempt was identified during the follow-up period.RESULTS: Patients with ASD had a higher incidence of suicide attempts (3.9% vs 0.7%, P < .001) than did those without ASD. Both adolescents (HR = 5.79; 95% CI, 3.98-8.41) and young adults (HR = 5.38; 95% CI, 3.58-8.06) with ASD were more likely to attempt suicide in later life after adjusting for demographic data and psychiatric comorbidities.

The present study aims to assess the rate of suicidality (suicidal ideation, behaviors and attempts) and associated risk factors for suicidality in high functioning ASD.METHODS: Medical records of 55 adolescents (six girls, 49 boys), aged between 7-20 years, with diagnosis of ASD were reviewed. The participants were all able to speak fluently and had no significant limitations in intellectual functioning. Clinical assessment of participants was carried out on the basis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition, Text Revision criteria and Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version. Eskin's Suicide Screening Questionnaire and sociodemographic data form including detailed history of suicidal behaviors were used. The study group was also divided into suicidal and non-suicidal groups for the purpose of comparing the results.RESULTS: The rate of suicidal behaviors was 29% and suicide attempt was 12.7%. Types of suicidality were behaviors (43.7%), thoughts (37.5%), and verbal declarations (18.7%). A number of bizarre acts were recorded. Rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders and disruptive behaviors were 23.6%, 43.6% and 65.4% respectively.

And the correlation between LTF expression and OSCC metastasis was assessed. MS-PCR was performed to reveal the methylation status in promoter regions of LTF both in OSCC tissue samples and cells. The influences of 5-Aza-Cdc treatment to the methylation status and expression levels of LTF were also analyzed. At last, the functions of LTF in OSCC progression were demonstrated by MTT analysis, clone formation assay, and cell cycle analysis in TCA8113 cells with forced ectopic expression of LTF.RESULTS: LTF showed a low or null expression pattern in OSCC tissues and cells, at least partially, due to the hypermethylated status in promoter regions for 5-Aza-Cdc, a methyltransferase inhibitor, could restore the expression of LTF in TCA8113 cells. And the expression level of LTF exhibited a negative correlation with OSCC metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: Re-expression of LTF inhibited the growth, proliferation, as well as cell cycle progression of TCA8113 cells. In conclusion, hypermethylation contributes much to LTF inactivation in OSCC.

However, little is known about the role of LTF in regulating the development of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The aim of our study was to investigate whether LTF could regulate the development of NPC by characterizing the pattern of LTF expression in human NPC tissues using cDNA and tissue microarrays. Loss of LTF expression was observed in a significantly higher frequency of NPC tissues compared to that in nontumor nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues. While 61.25% of NPC tissues at the T1/T2 stage were positive for LTF expression, only 40.82% of NPC at the T3/T4 stage were stained by anti-LTF. Similarly, 41.58% of NPC with local lymph node metastasis displayed LTF expression, a value significantly lower than the 46.36% in primary tumors (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that LTF may negatively regulate the development and metastasis of NPC in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of or treatment with LTF inhibited the proliferation of NPC cells and promoted cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase in vitro. While LTF treatment downregulated expression of cyclin D1 and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), expression of p21 and p27 in 5-8F NPC cells was enhanced. Moreover, LTF treatment modulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, but did not affect p53 and STAT3 expression in 5-8F NPC cells. Thus LTF is likely to be a candidate tumor suppressor and downregulates the development of NPC by inhibiting NPC proliferation through induction of cell cycle arrest and modulation of the MAPK signaling pathway.

Follow-up studies were conducted for 6 patients.RESULTS: All patients had abnormal MR imaging findings. The most common abnormalities were a small pituitary gland (76.9%), pronounced basal ganglia iron deposition (73%), and white matter lesions in 69.2%. White matter lesions showed frontoparietal and periventricular predominance. All white matter lesions spared subcortical U-fibers and were nonenhanced. Prominent perivascular spaces (15.3%) and restricted diffusion in the splenium of the corpus callosum (7.6%) were less frequent findings. Follow-up studies showed expansion of white matter lesions with iron deposition further involving the red nucleus and substantia nigra. Older age was associated with a more severe degree of white matter lesions (P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Small pituitary gland, accentuated iron deposition in the globus pallidus, and nonenhancing frontoparietal/periventricular white matter lesions were the most noted abnormalities seen in our cohort. The pattern and extent of these findings were observed to correlate with older age, reflecting a possible progressive myelin destruction and/or axonal loss.

Epilepsy describes a group of brain disorders whose symptoms and causes are diverse and complicated, but all share a common behavioural manifestation: the seizure. Seizures result from the abnormal discharge of groups of neurons within the brain, usually within a focal point, that can result in the recruitment of large brain regions into epileptiform activity. Although the range of explanations for the development of seizures can be as varied as genetic composition to acute head trauma, the net result is often similar. The excitability of neurons is governed by the input they receive from their neighbours and the intrinsic excitability of the neuron. In this review we focus on elements that are crucial to determining the intrinsic excitability of neurons in the CNS, the voltage gated ion channels (VGICs). VGICs as well as being important for physiological function are critical in producing hyperexcitability such as that associated with seizure discharges. Many drugs routinely used in the clinical setting, as well as several novel experimental drugs, have shown interactions with VGICs that underpin, at least in part, their anticonvulsant action. We review the physiological roles of voltage gated ion channels that are selective for sodium, potassium and calcium conductance and attempt to highlight their role in the pathology of epilepsy. This is supplemented by the mechanisms of drug action at these important anticonvulsant targets for classical and clinically relevant compounds (e.g. phenytoin, ethosuximide) as well as some important second generation drugs (e.g. gabapentin, levetiracetam) and novel experimental agents (e.g. retigabine, losigamone, safinamide).

All subjects received a single dose of 200 mg losigamone (1 tablet) in period 1 (on day 14) as well as multiple doses of losigamone (3 tablets = 600 mg per day) or placebo for 15 days in periods 2 and 3.

Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic investigations were performed on day 15 of periods 2 and 3. The samples were assayed to derive pharmacokinetic data of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. In addition, the concentrations of losigamone racemate (AO-33) and its enantiomers AO-242 and AO-294 were determined in these samples.RESULTS: The mean values of the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC and Cmax of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel after multiple-dose treatment with losigamone or placebo were quite similar and met the criteria for bioequivalence. The 90% confidence intervals of the log-transformed ratios of the geometric means of the primary pharmacokinetic variables were included in the respective acceptance ranges of 80% to 125% (AUC) and 70% to 143% (Cmax).CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that multiple doses of losigamone did not influence the multiple dose kinetics of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. The single- and multiple-dose kinetics of 200 mg losigamone and its enantiomeres did not differ from each other in a significant way.

The experimental data can be helpful for predicting effective drug combinations in patients with refractory epilepsy. Losigamone is a new antiepileptic drug with an unknown mechanism of action. The drug belongs to the group of beta-methoxy-butenolides, and exists as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (AO-242 and AO-294). The drug is eliminated by oxidation. Cytochrome CYP2A6 appears to be the main isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism of losigamone. In vitro, losigamone exerts anticonvulsant activity in the picrotoxin model in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas, the low Ca(2+) model in CA1 area and the low Mg(2+) model in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In vivo, the drug exhibits significant efficacy against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in rodents and pentetrazole-induced clonic convulsions in mice. Potency of losigamone varies with the respective seizure test, animal species used in experiments and route of drug administration. Toxicity studies do not indicate any teratogenic risk of the drug, at least in animals.

The effects of inclisiran on other lipids are less well described.METHODS: ORION-1 was a phase 2 trial assessing 6 different inclisiran dosing regimens versus placebo. Participants with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol despite receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy received a single-dose (200, 300, or 500 mg) or 2-dose starting regimen (100, 200, or 300 mg on days 1 and 90) of inclisiran or placebo. This prespecified analysis reports the percentage reductions in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein (apo) B, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), triglycerides, HDL-C, and apo A1 at the primary efficacy time point (day 180) with mixed-effect models for repeated measures. Additional prespecified analyses report time course of changes from baseline at each visit to day 210, interindividual variation in response, and lipid goal attainment.RESULTS: The mean age of the 501 participants was 63 years, 65% were male, 69% had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 73% used statins, and mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 128 mg/dL. A single dose of inclisiran reduced apo B, non-HDL-C, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol over 210 days. A second dose of inclisiran provided additional lowering of these lipids. At day 180, non-HDL-C was lowered dose-dependently: by 25% from 148±43 to 110±45 mg/dL in the 200-mg single-dose group and by 46% from 161±58 to 91±58 mg/dL in the 2-dose 300-mg group. For the same dosing regimens, apo B was reduced by 23% from 101±23 to 78±29 mg/dL and by 41% from 106±31 to 65±33 mg/dL ( P<0.001 for all groups versus placebo). In the 300-mg 2-dose group, all individuals experienced apo B and non-HDL-C reductions. There was larger interindividual variation in very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a) reductions. In the 300-mg 2-dose group, the percentages of patients achieving guideline-recommended apo B goals for high- and very-high-risk patients at day 180 were 78% and 90%; 68% and 83% of participants achieved non-HDL-C <100 and <130 mg/dL.CONCLUSIONS: Inclisiran produces significant and prolonged reductions in atherogenic lipoproteins, suggesting that inhibiting the synthesis of protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 through siRNA may be a viable alternative to other approaches that target protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

The present study investigates the potential effect of hesperidin, a flavanone group member, on 3-NP-induced behavioral, neurochemical, histopathological and cellular changes. Systemic administration of 3-NP to rats for 5 days (20 mg/kg) caused reduction of locomotor activity by days 2 and 5, 55% deficit of PPI response, elevation of cortical, striatal and hippocampal malondialdehyde (MDA) levels by 63%, 41% and 56%, reduction of respective catalase activity by 50%. Immunohistochemical staining of cortices, striata and hippocampi showed patches of iNOS positive cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells. Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%, 20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by 3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against 3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Hesperidin, a flavanoglycone abundantly present in citrus fruits, is reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?", "id": "5c674eac7c78d6947100001b_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Hesperidin, a flavanoglycone abundantly present in citrus fruits, is reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates the involvement of asporin in OA pathogenesis. Many human studies have been conducted to explore the association between the D-repeat polymorphisms and OA susceptibility, but these yield inconsistent results. Possible mechanisms for the involvement of asporin in OA pathology include its influence on TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β) signaling pathways and collagen mineralization. To date, no studies were found to use an asporin-deficient animal model that would help to understand disease mechanisms. Many issues must be addressed to clarify the link between asporin and OA to provide a novel therapeutic strategy for OA, perhaps through controlling and modifying the TGF-β-ECM system.CONCLUSIONS: Studies examined demonstrate the involvement of asporin in OA pathogenesis, and possible mechanisms by which asporin may be involved in this process have been proposed.

We used immunohistochemistry and H scoring to document stromal localisation of ASPN in a tissue microarray and mouse prostate cancer model, and correlated expression with reactive stroma, defined using Masson Trichrome staining. We used cell cultures of primary prostate cancer fibroblasts treated with serum-free conditioned media from prostate cancer cell lines to examine regulation of ASPN mRNA in tumour stromal cells.RESULTS: We observed increased expression of ASPN mRNA in a data set derived from benign vs tumour microdissected tissue, and a correlation with biochemical recurrence using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analysis. ASPN protein localised to tumour stroma and elevated expression of ASPN was correlated with decreased time to biochemical recurrence, in a cohort of 326 patients with a median follow up of 9.6 years. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that ASPN was correlated with progression, as were Gleason score, and clinical stage. Additionally, ASPN expression correlated with the presence of reactive stroma, suggesting that it may be a stromal marker expressed in response to the presence of tumour cells and particularly with aggressive tumour subtypes. We observed expression of ASPN in the stroma of tumours induced by p53 inhibition in a mouse model of prostate cancer, and correlation with neuroendocrine marker expression.

L-4F inhibited inflammation by reducing the accumulation of inflammatory cells, such as IL-17A-, IL-4-, GM-CSF-, IL-1β-, and IL-6-producing cells and Th1 and Th17.

Compared to the effect of the positive control, the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacine (4 mg/kg), which produced a 50 % decrease in inflammation, diethyl ether and N-butanol extracts exhibited about the same effect in doses of 200 and 100 mg/kg (53.6 and 48.7 %; 48.4 and 49.9 %, respectively). All investigated extracts produced dose-dependent gastroprotective activity with the efficacy comparable to that of the reference drug ranitidine. The diethyl ether extract showed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity on B16 cells and HL-60 cells, decreasing cell growth to 51.3 % and 77.5 % of control, respectively, when used at 100 µg/mL. It seems that phenolic compounds (apigenin, luteolin, and their corresponding glycosides) are responsible for the diethyl ether extract cytotoxic effect. It also appears that induction of oxidative stress might be involved in its cytotoxicity, since B16 and HL-60 cells increased their ROS production in response to treatment with diethyl ether extract. Neither of the tested extracts nor any phenolic compounds showed significant cytotoxic effect to human PBMC. These results demonstrated the potent anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective activities, as well as the promising cytotoxicity."}]}, {"title": "summary", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Gas vesicles (GVs)-a unique class of gas-filled protein nanostructures-have recently been introduced as a promising new class of ultrasound contrast agents that can potentially access the extravascular space and be modified for molecular targeting.

Here, we investigated the dynamics of the mitosomes, the simplest forms of mitochondria, in the anaerobic protist parasite Giardia intestinalis, a member of the Excavata supergroup of eukaryotes. The mitosomes have abandoned typical mitochondrial traits such as the mitochondrial genome and aerobic respiration and their single role known to date is the formation of iron-sulfur clusters.RESULTS: In live experiments, no fusion events were observed between the mitosomes in G. intestinalis. Moreover, the organelles were highly prone to becoming heterogeneous. This suggests that fusion is either much less frequent or even absent in mitosome dynamics. Unlike in mitochondria, division of the mitosomes was absolutely synchronized and limited to mitosis. The association of the nuclear and the mitosomal division persisted during the encystation of the parasite. During the segregation of the divided mitosomes, the subset of the organelles between two G. intestinalis nuclei had a prominent role. Surprisingly, the sole dynamin-related protein of the parasite seemed not to be involved in mitosomal division. However, throughout the cell cycle, mitosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), although none of the known ER-tethering complexes was present. Instead, the ER-mitosome interface was occupied by the lipid metabolism enzyme long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first report on the dynamics of mitosomes. We show that together with the loss of metabolic complexity of mitochondria, mitosomes of G. intestinalis have uniquely streamlined their dynamics by harmonizing their division with mitosis. We propose that this might be a strategy of G. intestinalis to maintain a stable number of organelles during cell propagation. The lack of mitosomal fusion may also be related to the secondary reduction of the organelles.

Simultaneous targeting of MOP and DOP can be accomplished by: (i) co-administering two selective drugs, (ii) administering one non-selective drug, or (iii) designing a single drug that specifically targets both receptors; a bivalent ligand. Bivalent ligands generally contain two active centres or pharmacophores that are variably separated by a chemical spacer and there are several interesting examples in the literature.

Here we analyze selective constraints and post-copulatory sexual selection acting on protamine 2 (Prm2) gene sequences of 53 species of primates and rodents. We focused on possible differences in selective constraints between these two clades and on the two functional domains of PRM2 (cleaved- and mature-PRM2). We also assessed if and how changes in Prm2 coding sequence may affect sperm head dimensions.RESULTS: The domain of Prm2 that is cleaved off during binding to DNA (cleaved-Prm2) was found to be under purifying selection in both clades, whereas the domain that remains bound to DNA (mature-Prm2) was found to be positively selected in primates and under relaxed constraint in rodents. Changes in cleaved-Prm2 coding sequence are significantly correlated to sperm head width and elongation in rodents. Contrary to expectations, a significant effect of sexual selection was not found on either domain or clade.CONCLUSIONS: Mature-PRM2 may be free to evolve under less constraint due to the existence of PRM1 as a more conserved and functionally redundant copy.

MiR-122 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis, which is achieved by directly targeting RUNX2. Overexpression of RUNX2 can partially abrogate the effect of miR-122 on glioma cells.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a crucial role of miR-122 in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Data were analyzed with the Student's t and Mann-Whitney tests. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: We showed that the A8 peptide aptamer binds to the extracellular domain of membrane HSP70 and used the aptamer to capture HSP70 exosomes from cancer patient samples. The number of HSP70 exosomes was higher in cancer patients than in healthy donors (mean, ng/mL ± SD = 3.5 ± 1.7 vs 0.17 ± 0.11, respectively, P = .004). Accordingly, all cancer cell lines examined abundantly released HSP70 exosomes, whereas \"normal\" cells did not. HSP70 had higher affinity for A8 than for TLR2; thus, A8 blocked HSP70/TLR2 association and the ability of tumor-derived exosomes to activate MDSCs. Treatment of tumor-bearing C57Bl/6 mice with A8 induced a decrease in the number of MDSCs in the spleen and inhibited tumor progression (n = 6 mice per group). Chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin or 5FU increase the amount of HSP70 exosomes, favoring the activation of MDSCs and hampering the development of an antitumor immune response. In contrast, this MDSC activation was not observed if cisplatin or 5FU was combined with A8. As a result, the antitumor effect of the drugs was strongly potentiated.CONCLUSIONS: A8 might be useful for quantifying tumor-derived exosomes and for cancer therapy through MDSC inhibition.© The Author 2015.

Melanoma is highly influenced in its aggressive phenotype by the changes it determinates in its microenvironment, such as pH decrease, in turn influencing cancer cell invasiveness, progression and tissue remodelling through an abundant secretion of exosomes, dictating cancer strategy to the whole host. A role of exosomes in driving melanoma progression under microenvironmental acidity was never described.METHODS: We studied four differently staged human melanoma lines, reflecting melanoma progression, under microenvironmental acidic pHs pressure ranging between pH 6.0-6.7. To estimate exosome secretion as a function of tumor stage and environmental pH, we applied a technique to generate native fluorescent exosomes characterized by vesicles integrity, size, density, markers expression, and quantifiable by direct FACS analysis. Functional roles of exosomes were tested in migration and invasion tests. Then we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of acid versus control exosomes to elucidate a specific signature involved in melanoma progression.RESULTS: We found that metastatic melanoma secretes a higher exosome amount than primary melanoma, and that acidic pH increases exosome secretion when melanoma is in an intermediate stage, i.e. metastatic non-invasive. We were thus able to show that acidic pH influences the intercellular cross-talk mediated by exosomes. In fact when exposed to exosomes produced in an acidic medium, pH naïve melanoma cells acquire migratory and invasive capacities likely due to transfer of metastatic exosomal proteins, favoring cell motility and angiogenesis. A Prognoscan-based meta-analysis study of proteins enriched in acidic exosomes, identified 11 genes (HRAS, GANAB, CFL2, HSP90B1, HSP90AB1, GSN, HSPA1L, NRAS, HSPA5, TIMP3, HYOU1), significantly correlating with poor prognosis, whose high expression was in part confirmed in bioptic samples of lymph node metastases.CONCLUSIONS: A crucial step of melanoma progression does occur at melanoma intermediate -stage, when extracellular acidic pH induces an abundant release and intra-tumoral uptake of exosomes.

This study investigated rheumatological care on a population basis, using claims data from a nationwide statutory health insurance fund (BARMER GEK) in combination with patient-reported outcomes from a questionnaire survey of insured persons with RA.METHODS: Data from insurants aged 18-79 years with M05 (seropositive RA) or M06 (other RA, ICD-10) diagnoses were analyzed concerning diagnostics, medication and prescribing physician. A 31-item questionnaire covering patient reported diagnosis, healthcare utilization and burden of illness was sent to a stratified random sample of 6193 insured persons. Data from the respondents regarding rheumatological care and disease status were evaluated.RESULTS: In 2013 and 2014, a total of 96,921 adults with M05 or M06 diagnosis were insured. The questionnaire was answered by 51% of the sample and of these 81% confirmed the RA diagnosis. RA had been diagnosed by a rheumatologist in 59% of the cases, 70% reported moderate to severe pain and 46% had functional disability. Between at least 40% (claims data) and up to 68% (respondents) were in specialized rheumatological care.

This mitochondria transfer protocol is adapted here for GSCs that present the specific particularity of growing as neurospheres in vitro. The transfer of the isolated mitochondria can be followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal imaging using mitochondria vital dyes. The use of mitochondria donor and target cells with distinct haplotypes (SNPs) also allows detection of the transferred mitochondria based on the concentration of their circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the target cells.

A de novo model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SEC and CZP compared with the other relevant comparators. The model was specified for three subpopulations, in accordance with the NICE scope (patients who have taken one prior DMARD, patients who have taken two or more prior DMARDs and biologic-experienced patients). The models were further classified according to the level of concomitant psoriasis.RESULTS: Nineteen eligible RCTs were included in the systematic review of short-term efficacy. Most studies were well conducted and were rated as being at low risk of bias. Trials of SEC and CZP demonstrated clinically important efficacy in all key clinical outcomes. At 3 months, patients taking 150 mg of SEC [relative risk (RR) 6.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.55 to 15.43] or CZP (RR 3.29, 95% CI 1.94 to 5.56) were more likely to be responders than patients taking placebo. The NMA results for the biologic-naive subpopulations indicated that the effectiveness of SEC and CZP relative to other biologics and each other was uncertain. Limited data were available for the biologic-experienced subpopulation. Longer-term evidence suggested that these newer biologics reduced disease progression, with the benefits being similar to those seen for older biologics. The de novo model generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for three subpopulations and three psoriasis subgroups. In subpopulation 1 (biologic-naive patients who had taken one prior DMARD), CZP was the optimal treatment in the moderate-severe psoriasis subgroup and 150 mg of SEC was optimal in the subgroups of patients with mild-moderate psoriasis or no concomitant psoriasis. In subpopulation 2 (biologic-naive patients who had taken two or more prior DMARDs), etanercept (ETN; ENBREL®, Pfizer Inc., New York City, NY, USA) is likely to be the optimal treatment in all subgroups. The ICERs for SEC and CZP versus best supportive care are in the region of £20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In subpopulation 3 (biologic-experienced patients or patients in whom biologics are contraindicated), UST is likely to be the optimal treatment (ICERs are in the region of £21,000-27,000 per QALY). The optimal treatment in subpopulation 2 was sensitive to the choice of evidence synthesis model. In subpopulations 2 and 3, results were sensitive to the algorithm for Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index costs. The optimal treatment is not sensitive to the use of biosimilar prices for ETN and infliximab (REMICADE®, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Kenilworth, NJ, USA).CONCLUSIONS: SEC and CZP may be an effective use of NHS resources, depending on the subpopulation and subgroup of psoriasis severity.

The 22 patients who received RIX treatment were analyzed. At the start of treatment, the following active manifestations were present: myositis (n = 18), lung involvement (mainly interstitial lung disease; n = 10), arthritis (n = 10), skin manifestation (n = 9), and Raynaud syndrome (n = 5). Nine of the patients were Jo-1-antibody positive. All patients had previous treatments with multiple conventional immunosuppressive drugs.

Chironomids (Diptera; Chironomidae), which occur worldwide and are frequently the insect found most abundantly in fresh water bodies, are natural reservoirs of V. cholerae. Quorum-sensing signals in V. cholerae up-regulate the production of an extracellular enzyme, haemagglutinin protease (HAP), which degrades chironomid egg masses and prevents the eggs from hatching. HAP, therefore, is a virulence factor against chironomids. Indeed, in a survey carried out over the course of a year, V. cholerae and chironomids showed a pattern that mirrored the dynamics of predator-prey populations. Globally, the numbers of chironomids are much larger than those of humans, so quorum-sensing signals of V. cholerae and HAP gene regulation should be understood with regard to their role in chironomids rather than humans.

Patients with the infantile form of Krabbe disease can be treated at a presymptomatic stage with human stem cell transplantation which improves survival and clinical outcomes. However, without a family history, most cases of infantile Krabbe disease present after onset of symptoms and are ineligible for transplantation. In 2006, New York began screening newborns for Krabbe disease to identify presymptomatic cases. To ensure that those identified with infantile disease received timely treatment, New York public health and medical systems took steps to accurately diagnose and rapidly refer infants for human stem cell transplantation within the first few weeks of life. After 11 years of active screening in New York and the introduction of Krabbe disease newborn screening in other states, new information has been gained which can inform the design of newborn screening programs to improve infantile Krabbe disease outcomes.FINDINGS: Recent information relevant to Krabbe disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment were assessed by a diverse group of public health, medical, and advocacy professionals. Outcomes after newborn screening may improve if treatment for infantile disease is initiated before 30 days of life. Newer laboratory screening and diagnostic tools can improve the speed and specificity of diagnosis and help facilitate this early referral. Given the rarity of Krabbe disease, most recommendations were based on case series or expert opinion.CONCLUSION: This report updates recommendations for Krabbe disease newborn screening to improve the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment of infantile Krabbe disease. In the United States, several states have begun or are considering Krabbe disease newborn screening. These recommendations can guide public health laboratories on methodologies for screening and inform clinicians about the need to promptly diagnose and treat infantile Krabbe disease. The timing of the initial referral after newborn screening, the speed of diagnostic confirmation of infantile disease, and the transplantation center's experience and ability to rapidly respond to a suspected patient with newly diagnosed infantile Krabbe disease are critical for optimal outcomes."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Because a mutation in CFL2 was identified in a family with nemaline myopathy, we performed sequence analysis of the gene and a novel homozygous missense mutation in exon 2 (c.19G>A, p.Val7Met) of CFL2 was identified in both siblings.

In the present study, a model of PD was generated by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the substantia nigra (SN) of rats in order to investigate the effects of SST on LPS-induced degeneration of DA in vivo. Intramural injection of LPS resulted in a significant loss of DA neurons, while reduction of neuronal death by SST pretreatment was confirmed using immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and Nissl. In parallel, immunohistochemical detection of OX-42 and hydroethidine staining were employed to determine the activation of microglia and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. It was found that SST inhibited the LPS-induced microglial activity and ROS production. ELISA revealed a decreased production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and prostaglandin E2 when SST was administered prior to LPS treatment. Western blot analysis showed that LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p-p65 was attenuated by administration of SST prior to LPS application. The results indicated that LPS-induced loss of nigral DA neurons was inhibited by SST and the observed effects of SST on neuroprotection were associated with suppression of microglial activation and the NF-κB pathway, ensuing decreases of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.

In the diabetic retina, a downregulation of SST production does exist. In this article, we give an overview of the mechanisms by which this deficit of SST participates in the main pathogenic mechanisms involved in diabetic retinopathy (DR): neurodegeneration, neovascularization, and vascular leakage. In view of the relevant SST functions in the retina and the reduction of SST production in the diabetic eye, SST replacement has been proposed as a new target for treatment of DR. This could be implemented by intravitreous injections of SST analogs or gene therapy, but this is an aggressive route for the early stages of DR. Since topical administration of SST has been effective in preventing retinal neurodegeneration in STZ-induced diabetic rats, it seems reasonable to test this new approach in humans. In this regard, the results of the ongoing clinical trial EUROCONDOR will provide useful information. In conclusion, SST is a natural neuroprotective and antiangiogenic factor synthesized by the retina which is downregulated in the diabetic eye and, therefore, its replacement seems a rational approach for treating DR.

Existing primary immunodeficiency registries are tailored to transplantation outcomes and do not capture the breadth of safety and efficacy endpoints required by the EMA for the long-term monitoring of gene therapies. Furthermore, for extended monitoring of Strimvelis, the young age of children treated, small patient numbers, and broad geographic distribution of patients all increase the risk of loss to follow-up before sufficient data have been collected. Establishing individual investigator sites would be impractical and uneconomical owing to the small number of patients from each location receiving Strimvelis.RESULTS: An observational registry has been established to monitor the safety and effectiveness of Strimvelis in up to 50 patients over a minimum of 15 years. To address the potential challenges highlighted above, data will be collected by a single investigator site at Ospedale San Raffaele (OSR), Milan, Italy, and entered into the registry via a central electronic platform. Patients/families and the patient's local physician will also be able to submit healthcare information directly to the registry using a uniquely designed electronic platform.

Endochondral bone development is mildly advanced due to accelerated hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes in Mir140-null mice. Comparison of profiles of RNA associated with Argonaute 2 (Ago2) between wild-type and Mir140-null chondrocytes identified Dnpep as a Mir140 target. As expected, Dnpep expression was increased in Mir140-null chondrocytes. Dnpep overexpression showed a mild antagonistic effect on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling at a position downstream of Smad activation. Mir140-null chondrocytes showed lower-than-normal basal BMP signaling, which was reversed by Dnpep knockdown.

Axin2 deficiency unexpectedly exacerbated calvarial components of the CCD phenotype in the Runx2(+/-) mice; the endocranial layer of the frontal suture, which develops by endochondral bone formation, failed to mineralize in Axin2(-/-):Runx2(+/-) mice, resulting in a cartilaginous, fibrotic and larger fontanel than observed in Runx2(+/-) mice.

The genetic dominance of Runx2 was also reflected during endochondral fracture repair, as both Runx2(+/-) and double mutant Axin2(-/-):Runx2(+/-) mice had enlarged fracture calluses at early stages of healing. However, by the end stages of fracture healing, double mutant animals diverged from the Runx2(+/-) mice, showing smaller calluses and increased torsional strength indicative of more rapid end stage bone formation as seen in the Axin2(-/-) mice.

In an analysis framed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, data extracted from 31 studies revealed six categories of psychosocial influences on acceptability and feasibility: uncertainty and misconceptions, cultural and ethnic values, family rules and values, difficulty following protocols and procedures, burden of multiple samples, and child refusal or resistance. Further research is required to fully understand the factors that influence acceptability and feasibility of salivary cortisol collection in community samples of children.

Salivary cortisol is a measure of active free cortisol and follows the diurnal rhythm of serum or plasma cortisol. The saliva sample may be collected by drooling or through the use of absorbent swabs which are placed into the mouth until saturated. Salivary cortisol is therefore convenient for patients and research participants to collect noninvasively on an outpatient basis. Several assay techniques have been used to measure salivary cortisol, including radioimmunoassay and more recently liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The analytical sensitivity varies between these assay methods, as does the potential for cross-reactivity with other steroids. The interpretation of salivary cortisol levels relies on rigorous standardization of sampling equipment, sampling protocols and assay technology with establishment of a local reference range. Clinically, the commonest use for salivary cortisol is measuring late-night salivary cortisol as a screening test for Cushing's syndrome. Several studies have shown diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of over 90%, which compares very favourably with other screening tests for Cushing's syndrome such as the 24-h urinary-free cortisol and the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test. There are emerging roles for the use of salivary cortisol in diagnosing adrenal insufficiency, particularly in conditions associated with low cortisol-binding globulin levels, and in the monitoring of glucocorticoid replacement.

By pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing, we demonstrated that PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling was induced in TGEV-infected ST cells, and ouabain imparted a degree of anti-TGEV activity via further augmentation of this existing PI3K_PDK1 axis signaling, in a manner dependent upon its association with the Na+/K+-ATPase. Finally, inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 or PDK1 by BX795 antagonized the anti-viral activity of ouabain and restored the TGEV virus titer and yields.

We tested hypotheses about the mode of action and macroevolution of toxicity in this group. We further hypothesized that while monarch butterflies are highly resistant to cardenolide toxins (a type of cardiac glycoside) from American Asclepias, they may be negatively affected by Pachypodium defenses, which evolved independently.METHODS: We grew 16 of 21 known Pachypodium spp. and quantified putative cardenolides by HPLC and also by inhibition of animal Na+ /K+ -ATPase (the physiological target of cardiac glycosides) using an in vitro assay. Pachypodium extracts were tested against monarch caterpillars in a feeding bioassay. We also tested four Asclepias spp. and five Pachypodium spp. extracts, contrasting inhibition of the cardenolide-sensitive porcine Na+ /K+ -ATPase to the monarch's resistant form.KEY RESULTS: We found evidence for low cardenolides by HPLC, but substantial toxicity when extracts were assayed on Na+ /K+ -ATPases. Toxicity showed phylogenetic signal, and taller species showed greater toxicity (this was marginal after phylogenetic correction). Application of Pachypodium extracts to milkweed leaves reduced monarch growth, and this was predicted by inhibition of the sensitive Na+ /K+ -ATPase in phylogenetic analyses. Asclepias extracts were 100-fold less potent against the monarch compared to the porcine Na+ /K+ -ATPase, but this difference was absent for Pachypodium extracts.CONCLUSIONS: Pachypodium contains potent toxicity capable of inhibiting sensitive and cardenolide-adapted Na+ /K+ -ATPases.

Most antineoplastic agents cause severe toxic effects and some types of cancer do not respond or are resistant to the existing pharmacotherapy, necessitating the research and development of new therapeutic strategies. Cardenolides have shown significant antitumor activity due to their ability to inhibit the Na+K+ATPase enzyme, and the expression of this enzyme is increased in tumor cells. Glucoevatromonoside containing peracetylated glucose hydroxyl groups (GEVPG) is a cardenolide derivative that has low solubility in aqueous media, which constitutes a barrier to its potential biological applications. In this context, the use of liposomes represents a promising strategy to deliver GEVPG, thus allowing its intravenous administration. In this study, long-circulating and fusogenic liposomes containing GEVPG (SpHL-GEVPG) were developed, and their chemical and physicochemical properties were evaluated. SpHL-GEVPG presented adequate properties, including a mean diameter of 182.2 ± 2.7 nm, a polydispersity index equal to 0.36 ± 0.03, a zeta potential of -2.37 ± 0.31 mV, and a GEVPG entrapment of 0.38 ± 0.04 mg/mL. Moreover, this formulation showed a good stability after having been stored for 30 days at 4 °C. The cytotoxic studies against breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and SKBR-3) and lung (A549) cancer cell lines demonstrated that SpHL-GEVPG treatment significantly reduced the cell viability. In addition, the SpHL-GEVPG formulation presented a good selectivity toward these cancer cells. The evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment with SpHL-GEVPG showed a potent anticancer effect in an A549 human lung cancer xenograft model. SpHL-GEVPG administered at doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg (i.v.) induced antitumor effect comparable to paclitaxel given at dose of 10 mg/kg (i.v.) to mice.

However, how chronic alcohol consumption causes hepatic lipid accumulation remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a causal role in alcoholic steatosis, inflammation, and liver injury. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding led to hyperactivation of mTORC1, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream kinase S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in hepatocytes. Aberrant activation of mTORC1 was likely attributed to the defects of the DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the liver of chronic-plus-binge ethanol-fed mice and in the liver of patients with ALD. Conversely, adenoviral overexpression of hepatic DEPTOR suppressed mTORC1 signaling and ameliorated alcoholic hepatosteatosis, inflammation, and acute-on-chronic liver injury. Mechanistically, the lipid-lowering effect of hepatic DEPTOR was attributable to decreased proteolytic processing, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). DEPTOR-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 also attenuated alcohol-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of the lipogenic regulator lipin 1 and prevented alcohol-mediated inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. Pharmacological intervention with rapamycin alleviated the ability of alcohol to up-regulate lipogenesis, to down-regulate fatty acid oxidation, and to induce steatogenic phenotypes. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding led to activation of SREBP-1 and lipin 1 through S6K1-dependent and independent mechanisms. Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific deletion of SIRT1 disrupted DEPTOR function, enhanced mTORC1 activity, and exacerbated alcoholic fatty liver, inflammation, and liver injury in mice.CONCLUSION: The dysregulation of SIRT1-DEPTOR-mTORC1 signaling is a critical determinant of ALD pathology; targeting SIRT1 and DEPTOR and selectively inhibiting mTORC1-S6K1 signaling may have therapeutic potential for treating ALD in humans.

Here, we approach these issues by investigating the role of the apical determinant protein Crumbs (Crb) during the morphogenesis of the embryonic Drosophila tracheal system. Crb accumulates differentially throughout tracheal development and is required for different tracheal events. The earliest requirement for Crb is for tracheal invagination, which is preceded by an enhanced accumulation of Crb in the invagination domain. There, Crb, acting in parallel with the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) pathway, is required for tracheal cell apical constriction and for organising an actomyosin complex, which we propose is mediated by Crb recruitment of moesin (Moe). The ability of a Crb isoform unable to rescue polarity in crb mutants to otherwise rescue their invagination phenotype, and the converse inability of a FERM-binding domain mutant Crb to rescue faulty invagination, support our hypothesis that it is the absence of Crb-dependent Moe enrichment, and not the polarity defect, that mainly underlies the crb invagination phenotype. This hypothesis is supported by the phenotype of lethal giant larvae (lgl); crb double mutants.

In vitro, the lead mAb (33A) displayed specific binding to acyl-ghrelin, with an estimated K(d) value < 100 pM. In recombinant receptor cell-based assays, 33A dose-dependently inhibited the ghrelin-mediated calcium signal, with an IC(50) of approximately 3.5 nM. In vivo, ghrelin dose-dependently stimulated food intake in mice, and this effect was fully blocked by a single injection of 33A. In a 4-week chronic study, 33A was shown to effectively bind to endogenous acyl-ghrelin; however, long-term administration of 33A did not affect food intake or body weight gain in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Our results indicate that peripheral neutralization of ghrelin can suppress appetite stimulated by a transient surge in ghrelin levels. The lack of long-term effects on body weight control by 33A suggests that compensatory mechanisms may contribute to the regulation of energy balance."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Ghrelin is primarily secreted from the stomach and has been implicated in the coordination of eating behavior and weight regulation.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Where in the body, is ghrelin secreted?", "id": "5caa06d0ecadf2e73f000056_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Ghrelin is primarily secreted from the stomach and has been implicated in the coordination of eating behavior and weight regulation. Ghrelin also plays an essential role in the mechanism of gastric mucosal defense. Thus, it is important to clarify which diseases primarily influence changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations. Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection is involved in the pathogenesis of gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer, gastric carcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H pylori eradication is related to body weight change. Compared, H pylori infected and negative subjects with normal body mass index, plasma ghrelin concentration, gastric ghrelin mRNA, and the number of ghrelin producing cells in gastric mucosa are significantly lower in H pylori infected subjects than in H pylori-negative controls. Plasma ghrelin concentration decreases with the progression of gastric atrophy. Impaired gastric ghrelin production in association with atrophic gastritis induced by H pylori infection accounts for the decrease in plasma ghrelin concentration. However, the ratio of plasma acylated ghrelin to total ghrelin levels is higher in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis than in healthy subjects. This may result from the compensatory increase in plasma active ghrelin concentration in response to gastric atrophy. After H pylori eradication, gastric preproghrelin mRNA expression is increased nearly 4-fold in most cases. However, changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations before and after H pylori cure are not associated with the gastric ghrelin production.

Most of the ghrelin produced in the body is secreted in the stomach, but it is also expressed in the hypothalamus, pituitary, pancreas, intestine, kidney, heart and gonads. Ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretion via growth hormone secretagogue receptors. Ghrelin secretion in the stomach depends on both acute and chronic changes in nutritional status and energy balance. Current data support the hypothesis that the stomach, in addition to its important role in digestion, not only influences pituitary hormone secretion but, via ghrelin production, it also sends orexigenic (appetite increasing) signals to hypothalamic nuclei involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. In addition to these main effects, ghrelin influences insulin secretion and glucose metabolism and it may exert potentially important effects on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal functions. Because of its effects on a large number of physiological functions, ghrelin may be involved in the pathomechanism of several human disorders, including disturbances of appetite, energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism.

Furthermore, OVX increased food intake and body weight in wild-type mice, but not in Ghsr(-/-) mice, suggesting that OVX increases food intake by releasing ghrelin from a tonic inhibitory effect of estradiol. In addition, following OVX, there was an increase in plasma ghrelin that was temporally associated with increased food intake, body weight, and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y and Agouti-related protein mRNA expression.

Ghrelin also stimulates pituitary gland secretion of growth hormone (GH) via the afferent vagus nerve. GH inhibits stomach ghrelin secretion. These findings indicate that the vagal circuit between the central nervous system and stomach has a crucial role in regulating plasma ghrelin levels. Moreover, body mass index modulates plasma ghrelin levels. In a lean state and anorexia nervosa, plasma ghrelin levels are increased, whereas in obesity, except in Prader-Willi syndrome, plasma ghrelin levels are decreased and the feeding- and sleeping-induced decline in plasma ghrelin levels is disrupted. There are two forms of ghrelin: active n-octanoyl-modified ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin. Fasting increases both ghrelin types compared with the fed state. Hyperphagia and obesity are likely to decrease plasma des-acyl ghrelin, but not n-octanoyl-modified ghrelin levels. Hypothalamic serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 and serotonin 5-HT2C/1B receptor gene expression levels are likely to be proportional to plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels during fasting, whereas they are likely to be inversely proportional to plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in an increased energy storage state such as obesity.

Ghrelin, the endogenous ligand for the GH secretagogue receptor, is the only peripheral orexigenic hormone that activates the receptors to be found especially in the appetite center (hypothalamus and pituitary gland). Ghrelin is present in human plasma in two forms: an inactive form known as deacylated ghrelin, and an active form called acylated ghrelin synthesized under the action of ghrelin O-acyltransferase enzyme (GOAT). The literature even mentions an extremely complex ghrelin/GOAT/GHSR system involved in the regulation of human energy, metabolism and adaptation of energy homeostasis to environmental changes. In humans, there is a preprandial rise and a postprandial fall in plasma ghrelin levels, which strongly suggest that the peptide plays a physiological role in meal initiation and may be employed in determining the amount and quality of ingested food. Besides the stimulation of food intake, ghrelin determines a decrease in energy expenditure and promotes the storage of fatty acids in adipocytes. Thus, in the human body ghrelin induces a positive energy balance, an increased adiposity gain, as well as an increase in caloric storage, seen as an adaptive mechanism to caloric restriction conditions. In the current world context, when we are witnessing an increasing availability of food and a reduction of energy expenditure to a minimum level, these mechanisms have become pathogenic.

Reactivation of ERM proteins within transmigrated pseudopods re-establishes their binding to targets, such as L-selectin. Knockdown of ezrin, but not moesin, severely impaired the recruitment of monocytes to activated endothelial monolayers under flow, suggesting that this protein plays a unique role in the early recruitment process. Ezrin binds preferentially to L-selectin in resting cells and during early TEM. The moesin-L-selectin interaction increases within transmigrated pseudopods as TEM proceeds, facilitating localised L-selectin ectodomain shedding. In contrast, a non-cleavable L-selectin mutant binds selectively to ezrin, driving multi-pseudopodial extensions.

Similarly, NFATc increased resistin expression in myocytes cultured in low glucose while the NFATc inhibitor VIVIT blocked glucose-induced resistin expression, suggesting that hyperglycemia/diabetes induces resistin expression possibly through NFATc activation. Interestingly, overexpression of Serca2a or VIVIT mitigated glucose-stimulated resistin and NFATc expression and enhanced AMPK activity, a downstream target of resistin signaling. NFATc direct activation of resistin was verified by resistin promoter luciferase activity and chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis. Interestingly, activation of Serca2a by a novel agonist, CDN1163, mirrored the effects of AAV9-Serca2a gene transfer on resistin expression and its promoter activity and AMPK signaling in diabetic mice. These findings parse a role for Ca2+ in resistin transactivation and provide support that manipulation of Serca2a-NFATc-Resistin axis might be useful in hyper-resistinemic conditions."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Resistin is a circulating mediator of insulin resistance mainly expressed in human monocytes and responsive to inflammatory stimuli.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is resistin?", "id": "5c840782617e120c34000006_012", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Resistin is a circulating mediator of insulin resistance mainly expressed in human monocytes and responsive to inflammatory stimuli. Recent clinical studies have connected elevated resistin levels with the development and severity of heart failure. To further our understanding of the role of human resistin in heart failure, we studied a humanized mouse model lacking murine resistin but transgenic for the human Retn gene (Hum-Retn mice), which exhibits basal and inflammation-stimulated resistin levels similar to humans. Specifically, we explored whether resistin underlies acute anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Remarkably, doxorubicin (25mg/kg ip) led to a 4-fold induction of serum resistin levels in Hum-Retn mice. Moreover, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was greater in the Hum-Retn mice than in littermate controls not expressing human resistin (Retn(-/-)). Hum-Retn mice showed increased cardiac mRNA levels of inflammatory and cell adhesion genes compared with Retn(-/-) mice. Macrophages, but not cardiomyocytes, from Hum-Retn mice treated with doxorubicin in vitro showed dramatic induction of hRetn (human resistin) mRNA and protein expression. We also examined resistin levels in anthracycline-treated breast cancer patients with and without cardiotoxicity. Intriguingly, serum resistin levels in women undergoing anthracycline-containing chemotherapy increased significantly at 3 months and remained elevated at 6 months in those with subsequent cardiotoxicity. Further, elevation in resistin correlated with decline in ejection fraction in these women. These results suggest that elevated resistin is a biomarker of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and may contribute in the development of heart failure via its direct effects on macrophages.

In this study, we further evaluated direct contact with fungal elements, synapse formation, and the response of macrophage-like THP-1 cells to C. albicans hyphae to determine the role of AIRE upon Dectin receptors function and signaling. We examined the fungal synapse (FS) formation in wild-type and AIRE-knockdown THP-1 cells differentiated to macrophages, as well as monocyte-derived macrophages from APECED patients. We evaluated Dectin-2 receptor signaling, phagocytosis, and cytokine secretion upon hyphal stimulation. AIRE co-localized with Dectin-2 and Syk at the FS upon hyphal stimulation of macrophage-like THP-1 cells. AIRE-knockdown macrophage-like THP-1 cells exhibited less Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 receptors accumulation, decreased signaling pathway activity at the FS, lower C. albicans phagocytosis, and less lysosome formation. Furthermore, IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α secretion by AIRE-knockdown macrophage-like THP-1 cells and AIRE-deficient patient macrophages was decreased compared to control cells.

Subdural empyema is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication following paranasal sinusitis and should be considered as a neurological emergency. The location where subdural empyema may appear is a challenge in diagnosis and treatment. We report the case of a 17-year-old boy who presented in a state of somnolence due to interhemispheric and infratentorial subdural empyema with preseptal cellulitis secondary to pansinusitis. Early diagnosis and aggressive antibiotic treatment combined with neurosurgical operation were mandatorily implemented. The case was managed using a multidisciplinary approach including the ENT, eye, and nutrition departments. The boy achieved clinical improvement, with impairment of eye movement as the only persistent symptom before discharge. Daily supervision at the primary health care center with continuous antibiotic treatment was recommended to the patient.

The empyema may develop intracranially or in the spinal canal. Intracranial subdural empyema is most frequently a complication of sinusitis or, less frequently, otitis or neurosurgical procedures. Spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. The most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in particular those of the Streptococcus milleri group (S. milleri and Streptococcus anginosus). Staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including Gram-negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides, may be present. Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and Salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced AIDS; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. Spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by S. aureus. Subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical and neurosurgical emergency. The diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial and spinal subdural empyema is MRI with gadolinium enhancement. Computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by MRI. Conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by CT myelography where MRI is negative. Treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. Pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. Because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against S. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and Gram-negative organisms. Antibiotics should include 1) nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin; plus 2) a third generation cephalosporin; plus 3) metronidazole. Provisional antibiotic therapy of spinal subdural empyemas should be directed against S. aureus and streptococci, and should include nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin.

This mechanism termed 'quorum sensing' is involved in the regulation of physiological functions as well as multiple virulence determinants. It becomes more and more evident, that bacteria communicate not only with each other but also with their host. Up to now, little is known about this interkingdom communication. The AHL quorum sensing molecule N-3-(oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to influence the immune system of the host. The role and potential influence of other AHL molecules from other bacteria have so far not been determined. In this paper, we investigated the role of 7 different AHLs on apoptosis of human Jurkat T lymphocytes. We found, that among all homoserine lactones tested, only OdDHL rapidly induced apoptosis which was accompanied by the breakdown of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). Since overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 completely abrogated the apoptotic effect, we presume that OdDHL induces apoptosis by activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The reason that bacteria induce apoptosis is largely unknown. We suspect that through apoptosis an anti-inflammatory response is triggered."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The genomes of many bacteria that participate in nitrogen cycling through the process of nitrification contain putative genes associated with acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS).", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the role of Acyl-Homoserine Lactone  in bacteria?", "id": "5c979383ecadf2e73f000027_006", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The genomes of many bacteria that participate in nitrogen cycling through the process of nitrification contain putative genes associated with acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS). AHL QS or bacterial cell-cell signaling is a method of bacterial communication and gene regulation and may be involved in nitrogen oxide fluxes or other important phenotypes in nitrifying bacteria. Here, we carried out a broad survey of AHL production in nitrifying bacteria in three steps. First, we analyzed the evolutionary history of AHL synthase and AHL receptor homologs in sequenced genomes and metagenomes of nitrifying bacteria to identify AHL synthase homologs in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) of the genus Nitrosospira and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) of the genera Nitrococcus, Nitrobacter, and Nitrospira Next, we screened cultures of both AOB and NOB with uncharacterized AHL synthase genes and AHL synthase-negative nitrifiers by a bioassay. Our results suggest that an AHL synthase gene is required for, but does not guarantee, cell density-dependent AHL production under the conditions tested. Finally, we utilized mass spectrometry to identify the AHLs produced by the AOB Nitrosospira multiformis and Nitrosospira briensis and the NOB Nitrobacter vulgaris and Nitrospira moscoviensis as N-decanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C10-HSL), N-3-hydroxy-tetradecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3-OH-C14-HSL), a monounsaturated AHL (C10:1-HSL), and N-octanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL), respectively. Our survey expands the list of AHL-producing nitrifiers to include a representative of Nitrospira lineage II and suggests that AHL production is widespread in nitrifying bacteria.IMPORTANCE Nitrification, the aerobic oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite by nitrifying microorganisms, plays an important role in environmental nitrogen cycling from agricultural fertilization to wastewater treatment. The genomes of many nitrifying bacteria contain genes associated with bacterial cell-cell signaling or quorum sensing (QS). QS is a method of bacterial communication and gene regulation that is well studied in bacterial pathogens, but less is known about QS in environmental systems. Our previous work suggested that QS might be involved in the regulation of nitrogen oxide gas production during nitrite metabolism. This study characterized putative QS signals produced by different genera and species of nitrifiers. Our work lays the foundation for future experiments investigating communication between nitrifying bacteria, the purpose of QS in these microorganisms, and the manipulation of QS during nitrification."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Many proteobacteria use acyl-homoserine lactones as quorum-sensing signals.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the role of Acyl-Homoserine Lactone  in bacteria?", "id": "5c979383ecadf2e73f000027_007", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Many proteobacteria use acyl-homoserine lactones as quorum-sensing signals.

The 22 patients who received RIX treatment were analyzed. At the start of treatment, the following active manifestations were present: myositis (n = 18), lung involvement (mainly interstitial lung disease; n = 10), arthritis (n = 10), skin manifestation (n = 9), and Raynaud syndrome (n = 5). Nine of the patients were Jo-1-antibody positive. All patients had previous treatments with multiple conventional immunosuppressive drugs. Treatment with RIX was given as infusions of 1 g i. v., which were repeated after 2 weeks. Patients received a mean of 3.09 ± 2.27 infusions (equivalent to 1.5 cycles of 2 × 1 g, max. 5 cycles).

In all, 27 adverse events were documented, with the majority being infections, whereby 2 severe infections occurred (6.59 per 100 patient-years). Eighty six percent of the patients showed complete remission of their myositis and 79% of their arthritis.

While the apo Pim1 structure is nearly identical with that reported recently, the structure of AMPPNP bound to Pim1 is significantly different. Pim1 is unique among protein kinases due to the presence of a proline residue at position 123 that precludes the formation of the canonical second hydrogen bond between the hinge backbone and the adenine moiety of ATP. One crystal structure reported here shows that changing P123 to methionine, a common residue that offers the backbone hydrogen bond to ATP, does not restore the ATP binding pocket of Pim1 to that of a typical kinase.

Increasing evidence suggests that tumour-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs) facilitate tumour progression by acquiring a M2-like phenotype. Our objective was to investigate the prognostic value of TAMs in gliomas using automated quantitative double immunofluorescence.METHODS: Samples from 240 patients with primary glioma were stained with antibodies against ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA-1) and cluster of differentiation 204 (CD204) to detect TAMs and M2-like TAMs. The expression levels were quantified by software-based classifiers. The associations between TAMs, gemistocytic cells and glioblastoma subtype were examined with immuno- and haematoxylin-eosin stainings. Three tissue arrays containing glioblastoma specimens were included to study IBA-1/CD204 levels in central tumour and tumour periphery and to characterize CD204+ cells.RESULTS: Our data revealed that the amount of especially CD204+ TAMs increases with malignancy grade. In grade III-IV, high CD204 expression was associated with shorter survival, while high IBA-1 intensity correlated with a longer survival. In grade IV, CD204 showed independent prognostic value when adjusting for clinical data and the methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. Our findings were confirmed in two bioinformatics databases. TAMs were more abundant in central tumour tissue, mesenchymal glioblastomas and gliomas with many gemistocytic cells. CD204+ TAMs co-expressed proteins related to tumour aggressiveness including matrix metallopeptidase-14 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to use automated quantitative immunofluorescence to determine the prognostic impact of TAMs. Our results suggest that M2-like TAMs hold an unfavourable prognostic value in high-grade gliomas and may contribute to a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment.© 2017 The Authors.

This study was aimed at investigating molecular changes at the level of the proteome that are associated with the activation of pancreatic stellate cells by proinflammatory factors, namely TNF-α, FGF2, IL6, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4). They were added individually to cells growing in serum-free medium next to controls in medium supplemented with serum, thus containing a mixture of them all, or in serum-free medium alone. Variations were detected by means of a microarray of 810 antibodies targeting relevant proteins. All tested factors triggered increased proliferation and migration. Further analysis showed that TNF-α is the prime factor responsible for the activation of pancreatic stellate cells. CCL4 is associated with cellular neovascularization, whereas FGF2 and IL6 induction led to better cellular survival and decreased apoptotic activity of the stellate cells. The identified direct effects of individual cytokines on human pancreatic stellate cells provide new insights about their contribution to pancreatic cancer promotion."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Activated PSCs expressed IL-33 in the nucleus, and the expression was increased by IL-1β, TNF-α, PDGF-BB, and IFN-γ, but not TGF-β1.

Recent studies have suggested a role of IL-33, a newly identified IL-1 family member, in fibrosis. We here examined the expression of IL-33 and the IL-33-mediated regulation of cell functions in PSCs. PSCs were isolated from human and rat pancreas tissues. The expression of IL-33 was examined by Western blotting, PCR, ELISA, and immunostaining. The roles of IL-33 in the regulation of PSC functions were examined by using recombinant IL-33 and small interfering RNA. Activated PSCs expressed IL-33 in the nucleus, and the expression was increased by IL-1β, TNF-α, PDGF-BB, and IFN-γ, but not TGF-β1. Nuclear IL-33 expression was also observed in the pancreatic acinar and ductal cells. IL-1β induced IL-33 expression mainly through the activation of NF-κB and ERK pathways and partially through that of p38 MAP kinase, whereas PDGF-BB induced IL-33 expression mainly through the activation of ERK pathway. PSCs expressed soluble ST2, ST2L, and IL-1RAcP, but the expression level of ST2L was relatively low. Recombinant IL-33 did not stimulate key cell functions of PSCs. Decreased IL-33 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased proliferation in response to PDGF-BB. In conclusion, activated PSCs expressed IL-33 in the nucleus. IL-33 might regulate the PDGF-induced proliferation in PSCs."}]}, {"title": "yesno", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Interest in the recently discovered phenomenon of mitochondrial transfer between mammalian cells has gained momentum since it was first described in cell culture systems more than a decade ago.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Can mitochondria transfer from cell to cell?", "id": "5c9e738decadf2e73f000037_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Interest in the recently discovered phenomenon of mitochondrial transfer between mammalian cells has gained momentum since it was first described in cell culture systems more than a decade ago.

Genetic approaches that use mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms have also been used in some in vitro studies and in tumor models and are particularly useful where mtDNA is damaged or deleted. These approaches can also be used to study the long-term consequences of mitochondrial transfer such as in bone marrow and organ transplantation and in tumour biology where inherent mitochondrial damage is often a key feature.
