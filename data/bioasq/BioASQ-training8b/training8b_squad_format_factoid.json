As HDAC inhibitors may counteract these tumorigenic effects several of these compounds are currently tested in clinical trials. HDAC inhibitors are also considered for urothelial carcinoma, where novel therapeutic drugs are urgently required. However, only modest antineoplastic activity has been observed with isoenzyme-unspecific pan-HDAC inhibitors. Therefore, inhibition of specific HDAC isoenzymes might be more efficacious and tumor-specific. Here, we systematically review knowledge on the expression, function and suitability as therapeutic targets of the 11 classical HDACs in UC. Overall, the class I HDACs HDAC1 and HDAC2 are the most promising targets for antineoplastic treatment. In contrast, targeting HDAC8 and HDAC6 is likely to be of minor relevance in urothelial carcinoma.

However, although HDAC proteins have shown to be expressed in the developing vertebrate neural tube, their specific role in CNS neural progenitor fate specification remains unclear. Prior work from our lab showed that the Tcf7l2/Tcf4 transcription factor plays a key role in ventral progenitor lineage segregation by differential repression of two key specification factors, Nkx2.2 and Olig2. In this study, we found that administration of HDAC inhibitors (Valproic Acid (VPA), Trichostatin-A (TSA), or sodium butyrate) in chick embryos in ovo disrupted normal progenitor gene segregation in the developing neural tube, indicating that HDAC activity is required for this process. Further, using functional and pharmacological approaches in vivo, we found that HDAC activity is required for the differential repression of Nkx2.2 and Olig2 by Tcf7l2/Tcf4. Finally, using dominant-negative functional assays, we provide evidence that Tcf7l2/Tcf4 repression also requires Gro/TLE/Grg co-repressor factors.

These class II HDAC proteins have differential mRNA expression in human tissues and possess in vitro HDAC activity that is inhibited by trichostatin A. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that these HDAC proteins are not components of the previously identified HDAC1 and HDAC2 NRD and mSin3A complexes.

Thus far, 11 members of the HDAC family have been identified in humans, but few have been characterized in detail. To better define the biological function of these proteins, make maximal use of studies performed in other systems, and assist in drug development efforts, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of all HDAC-related proteins in all fully sequenced free-living organisms. Previous analyses have divided non-sirtuin HDACs into two groups, classes 1 and 2. We find that HDACs can be divided into three equally distinct groups: class 1, class 2, and a third class consisting of proteins related to the recently identified human HDAC11 gene. We term this novel group \"class 4\" to distinguish it from the unrelated \"class 3\" sirtuin deacetylases. Analysis of gene duplication events indicates that the common ancestor of metazoan organisms contained two class 1, two class 2, and a single class 4 HDAC. Examination of HDAC characteristics in light of these evolutionary relationships leads to functional predictions, among them that self-association is common among HDAC proteins. All three HDAC classes (including class 4) exist in eubacteria.

In oncology patients, the safety cannot yet be guaranteed, since current tumor detection methods can only exclude the presence of malignant cells in ovarian fragments that are not transplanted. We determined the need for a novel detection method by studying the distribution of tumor cells in ovaries from patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, we examined which cell-surface proteins are suitable as a target for non-invasive tumor-specific imaging of ovarian metastases from invasive breast cancer.METHODS: Using the nationwide database of the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA), we identified a cohort of 46 women with primary invasive breast cancer and ovarian metastases. The localization and morphology of ovarian metastases were determined on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections. The following cell-surface markers were immunohistochemically analyzed: E-cadherin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), human epidermal growth receptor type 2 (Her2/neu), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), αvβ6 integrin and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM).RESULTS: The majority of ovarian metastases (71%) consisted of a solitary metastasis or multiple distinct nodules separated by uninvolved ovarian tissue, suggesting that ovarian metastases might be overlooked by the current detection approach. Combining the targets E-cadherin, EMA and Her2/neu resulted in nearly 100% detection of ductal ovarian metastases, whereas the combination of EMA, Her2/neu and EpCAM was most suitable to detect lobular ovarian metastases.CONCLUSIONS: Examination of the actual ovarian transplants is recommended.

Recent research pointed to a close interaction of EpCAM with other cell-cell contact molecules like E-cadherin and claudins and an intimate crosstalk with Wnt and TGF-beta signaling in the regulation of cell growth. Moreover, EpCAM has been shown to modulate trans-epithelial migration processes of white blood cells. Mutations of the EpCAM gene lead to disturbances of epithelial homeostasis and cellular differentiation from the stem cell compartment. In the intestinal tract EpCAM mutations contribute to congenital tufting enteropathy. Regarding tumorigenesis EpCAM can act as an oncogene still depending on additional driver mutations and epithelial phenotype of tumor cells. Tumor cells display increased EpCAM expression that often correlates with the loss of strict basolateral localization. Many tumors show enhanced regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of EpCAM and loose EpCAM expression under conditions of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The resulting extracellular EpEX and intracellular EpICD fragments mediate proliferative signals to the cell.

Twenty-four cases of papillary hyperplasia of thyroid were used as controls.RESULTS: In all of the 24 cases of papillary hyperplasia, EpCAM was located on the cell membrane, while in the 91 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma studied, EpCAM was located within the cytoplasm, with 36.3% (33/91) showing nuclear localization as well. In all the papillary hyperplasia cases studied, E-cadherin showed membranous expression. E-cadherin expression was reduced in 84.6% (77/91) of papillary thyroid carcinoma, as compared with the surrounding native thyroid parenchyma. Amongst the 33 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma which showed nuclear localization of EpCAM, 30 cases also showed reduced E-cadherin expression. There was a positive correlation between nuclear expression of EpCAM and loss of E-cadherin expression (P = 0.000; Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.857). Nuclear expression of EpCAM correlated with follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma and presence of extrathyroidal extension ( P = 0.037 and 0.033, respectively).

Knockdown of EpCAM in T84 and Caco-2 cells using shRNAs led to changes in morphology and adhesiveness. TJ formed readily after EpCAM knockdown; the acquisition of trans-epithelial electroresistance was enhanced, and TJ showed increased resistance to disruption by calcium chelation. Preparative immunoprecipitation demonstrated that EpCAM bound tightly to claudin-7. Co-immunoprecipitation documented associations of EpCAM with claudin-7 and claudin-1 but not claudin-2 or claudin-4. Claudin-1 associated with claudin-7 in co-transfection experiments, and claudin-7 was required for association of claudin-1 with EpCAM. EpCAM knockdown resulted in decreases in claudin-7 and claudin-1 proteins that were reversed with lysosome inhibitors. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that claudin-7 and claudin-1 continually trafficked into lysosomes. Although EpCAM knockdown decreased claudin-1 and claudin-7 protein levels overall, accumulations of claudin-1 and claudin-7 in TJ increased.

Liver regeneration is associated with a population of EpCAM-positive cells within ductular reactions, which gradually lose the expression of EpCAM along with maturation into hepatocytes. EpCAM can be switched on and off through a wide panel of strategies to fine-tune EpCAM-dependent functional and differentiative traits. EpCAM-associated functions relate to cell-cell adhesion, proliferation, maintenance of a pluripotent state, regulation of differentiation, migration, and invasion. These functions can be conferred by the full-length protein and/or EpCAM-derived fragments, which are generated upon regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Control by EpCAM therefore not only depends on the presence of full-length EpCAM at cellular membranes but also on varying rates of the formation of EpCAM-derived fragments that have their own regulatory properties and on changes in the association of EpCAM with interaction partners. Thus spatiotemporal localization of EpCAM in immature liver progenitors, transit-amplifying cells, and mature liver cells will decisively impact the regulation of EpCAM functions and might be one of the triggers that contributes to the adaptive processes in stem/progenitor cell lineages.

In addition to the pain generated by formalin itself, the classical formalin test for nociception comprises a number of additional strong stressful events such as restraint and injury caused by needle insertion. These events have hampered its use as a model of stress employing continuous pain as a stress stimulus. We describe here a new, simple method of a subcutaneous application of formalin in conscious rats without restraint and needle insertion. Formalin or physiological saline (controls) was injected subcutaneously through a chronically implanted catheter in the region of the lower leg. In most animals, the cardiovascular and behavioural responses to subcutaneously injected formalin were biphasic. The early phase was quantitatively characterized. Formalin (2.5%, 50 microL) induced a marked increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Maximal increases occurred during the first 3 min after formalin injection and were followed by a gradual decline of both cardiovascular parameters to levels higher than the preinjection baseline. Subcutaneous saline injection did not induce any changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The behavioural response to formalin featured intensive licking and biting of the injection site. The behavioural response to subcutaneous saline did not differ from the spontaneous behavioural activity recorded in noninjected rats. Subcutaneously injected formalin induced an immediate increase in plasma corticotrophin (ACTH), corticosterone, noradrenaline, and adrenaline levels, and all hormones remained increased during the whole observation period (60 min). Adrenaline and noradrenaline levels in plasma were slightly, but significantly, elevated during the initial 5 min after subcutaneous saline application but returned to basal values after 15 min. The magnitude of the hormonal responses characterizes the described formalin test as a moderate stress stimulus. The complex response pattern to formalin injected through the subcutaneous catheter is brought about exclusively by pain generated by formalin-induced tissue injury. The described technique of subcutaneous formalin injection represents a new tool to study mechanisms activating brain neuronal circuits that generate the cardiovascular, endocrine, and behavioural responses of the reaction to pain."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The formalin test is used as a primary behavioural screen for assaying the antinociceptive activity of compounds in laboratory rodents.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the Formalin test used for?", "id": "5abbfd97fcf456587200001d_010", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The formalin test is used as a primary behavioural screen for assaying the antinociceptive activity of compounds in laboratory rodents.

The anti-epileptic drugs gabapentin (50-200 mg/kg) and lamotrigine (10-60 mg/kg) were antinociceptive only during second phase in both 1% and 5% tests. Notably, they were 2-4 times more potent in 1% vs 5% formalin-injected rats. The dual monoamine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine (3-60 mg/kg) consistently attenuated nociceptive behaviours during first phase and interphase in both tests.

Administration of naloxone (1mg/kg) decreased nociception in phase 2A; but had no effect on delayed termination of formalin test.DISCUSSION: The results of this study suggest the existence of an active inhibitory mechanism, other than the endogenous opioids, that is responsible for termination of nociceptive behaviour at the end of formalin test."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The rat paw formalin test is a model of prolonged pain due to mild tissue injury.

There is some evidence suggesting that morphine does not produce antinociception in the formalin test via the brain-stem and spinal cord circuitry normally associated with antinociception. Furthermore, morphine appears to require an intact forebrain in order to function as an analgesic for formalin pain. In the 2 experiments reported here, we investigated the possibility that the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) contributes to the production of morphine antinociception (MA) in the formalin test. Nociception in this test occurs in 2 phases, with the 1st phase occurring 0-5 min after formalin injection and the 2nd phase beginning 10-15 min after injection and continuing for approximately 1 h. In Exp. 1, bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the Ce, but not lesions of the adjacent basolateral nucleus (BL), reliably attenuated MA (7 mg/kg morphine sulfate) during the 2nd phase of the formalin test without affecting baseline nociception. These results were obtained regardless of whether the rating scale method or flinch-frequency method of nociceptive scoring was used. During the 1st phase, Ce lesions reliably attenuated MA as measured by the flinch-frequency method, but not as measured by the rating scale method. In Exp. 2, Ce lesions also reliably attenuated the antinociception produced by 12 mg/kg morphine sulfate during the 2nd phase of the formalin test. Antinociception appeared to be almost completely re-instated, however, if the dose of morphine was raised to 20 mg/kg. The results indicate that neurons originating from the Ce contribute to the production of MA during the 2nd phase, and possibly the 1st phase, of the formalin test, especially at relatively lower doses of morphine. This suggests that in addition to coordinating conditioned antinociceptive responses, the amygdala may be a component of endogenous antinociceptive circuitry. These and other issues are discussed with reference to the spino-ponto-amygdaloid nociceptive pathway, and the proposed role of the amygdala in the mediation of defense reactions."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The formalin test is increasingly applied as a model of inflammatory pain using high formalin concentrations (5-15%).

Neurological examination revealed flaccid paralysis of both lower extremities with negative Babinski's reflex, and sensory disturbance below the level of L1.

Metrizamide myelography disclosed an incomplete blockage caused by an epidural mass at the level of T11. Post-myelographic CT scan demonstrated a sharply demarcated extradural filling defect at the level of T11. Seventeen hours after the onset of symptoms, an emergency laminectomy was performed extending from T12 to L3, and the epidural clot was totally evacuated.

Patients known to have thrombophilia or on anticoagulant drugs are the most affected. It is generally caused by a rupture of the postero-internal vertebral venous plexus secondary to minor barotrauma such as cough, peridural catheter insertion... Early diagnosis and treatment showed to have the best outcome.CASES REPORT: We report 3 cases of spontaneous epidural hematoma in patients treated by acenocoumarol, which occurred without any provocative factor. All 3 patients were treated with decompressive laminectomy.DISCUSSION: We described the MRI findings and discussed the spontaneity of the entity. Our present case studies and the review of the literature showed that early diagnosis and management of SEHS can lead to improvement of the neurological state and avoid definitive motor and sensitive deficit.CONCLUSION: This rare entity should be suspected in every acute medullary syndrome with spinal pain, motor and/or sensory deficit.

It is a rare and usually severe neurological disorder that, without adequate treatment, often leads to death or permanent neurological deficit. Epidural as well as subdural and subarachnoid hematomas have been investigated. Some cases of subarachnoid spinal hematoma may present with symptoms similar to those of cerebral hemorrhage. The literature offers no reliable estimates of the incidence of spinal hematoma, perhaps due to the rarity of this disorder. In the present work, 613 case studies published between 1826 and 1996 have been evaluated, which represents the largest review on this topic to date. Most cases of spinal hematoma have a multifactorial etiology whose individual components are not all understood in detail. In up to a third of cases (29.7%) of spinal hematoma, no etiological factor can be identified as the cause of the bleeding. Following idiopathic spinal hematoma, cases related to anticoagulant therapy and vascular malformations represent the second and third most common categories. Spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures in combination with anticoagulant therapy represent the fifth most common etiological group and spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures alone represent the tenth most common cause of spinal hematoma. Anticoagulant therapy alone probably does not trigger spinal hemorrhage. It is likely that there must additionally be a \"locus minoris resistentiae\" together with increased pressure in the interior vertebral venous plexus in order to cause spinal hemorrhage. The latter two factors are thought to be sufficient to cause spontaneous spinal hematoma. Physicians should require strict indications for the use of spinal anesthetic procedures in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy, even if the incidence of spinal hematoma following this combination is low. If spinal anesthetic procedures are performed before, during, or after anticoagulant treatment, close monitoring of the neurological status of the patient is warranted. Time limits regarding the use of anticoagulant therapy before or after spinal anesthetic procedures have been proposed and are thought to be safe for patients. Investigation of the coagulation status alone does not necessarily provide an accurate estimate of the risk of hemorrhage. The most important measure for recognizing patients at high risk is a thorough clinical history. Most spinal hematomas are localized dorsally to the spinal cord at the level of the cervicothoracic and thoracolumbar regions. Subarachnoid hematomas can extend along the entire length of the subarachnoid space. Epidural and subdural spinal hematoma present with intense, knife-like pain at the location of the hemorrhage (\"coup de poignard\") that may be followed in some cases by a pain-free interval of minutes to days, after which there is progressive paralysis below the affected spinal level. Subarachnoid hematoma can be associated with meningitis symptoms, disturbances of consciousness, and epileptic seizures and is often misdiagnosed as cerebral hemorrhage based on these symptoms. Most patients are between 55 and 70 years old. Of all patients with spinal hemorrhage, 63.9% are men. The examination of first choice is magnetic resonance imaging. The treatment of choice is surgical decompression. Of the patients investigated in the present work, 39.6% experienced complete recovery. The less severe the preoperative symptoms are and the more quickly surgical decompression can be performed, the better are the chances for complete recovery. It is therefore essential to recognize the relatively typical clinical presentation of spinal hematoma in a timely manner to allow correct diagnostic and therapeutic measures to be taken to maximize the patient's chance of complete recovery."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We report the case of a man of 65 who, at 20 and 37 days from surgery of C6 corpectomy, experienced two epidural hematomas at C7-D1.

As a result, the rate at which signaling molecules traverse the endocytic pathway makes a significant contribution to downstream output. Modulation of the core endocytic machinery facilitates differential uptake of individual cargoes. Clathrin-coated pits are a major entry portal where assembled clathrin forms a lattice around invaginating buds that have captured endocytic cargo. Clathrin assembles into triskelia composed of three clathrin heavy chains and associated clathrin light chains (CLCs). Despite the identification of clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface over 30 years ago, the functions of CLCs in endocytosis have been elusive.RESULTS: In this work, we identify a novel role for CLCs in the regulated endocytosis of specific cargoes. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either CLCa or CLCb inhibits the uptake of GPCRs. Moreover, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser204 in CLCb is required for efficient endocytosis of a subset of GPCRs and identify G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a kinase that can phosphorylate CLCb on Ser204. Overexpression of CLCb(S204A) specifically inhibits the endocytosis of those GPCRs whose endocytosis is GRK2-dependent.CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results indicate that CLCb phosphorylation acts as a discriminator for the endocytosis of specific GPCRs.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We extend the earlier solution studies by performing small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments on isolated triskelia, allowing us to examine a higher q range than that probed by static light scattering. Results of the SANS measurements are consistent with the light scattering measurements, but show a shoulder in the scattering function at intermediate q values (0.016 A(-1)), just beyond the Guinier regime. This feature can be accounted for by Brownian dynamics simulations based on flexible bead-spring models of a triskelion, which generate time-averaged scattering functions.

In order to test/reject ancient admixture from genome-wide data, we incorporate the model of genetic introgression into a statistical hypothesis-testing framework.

In the present study, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity among a worldwide collection of contemporary human populations with respect to the genetic constitution of these two archaic hominins and Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee). We partitioned SNPs into subsets, including those that are derived in both archaic lineages, those that are ancestral in both archaic lineages and those that are only derived in one archaic lineage. By doing this, we have conducted separate examinations of subsets of mutations with higher probabilities of divergent phylogenetic origins. While previous investigations have excluded SNPs from common ancestors in principal component analyses, we included common ancestral SNPs in our analyses to visualize the relative placement of the Neanderthal and Denisova among human populations.

However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans.

Comparing protein-DNA binding maps allows us, for the first time, to attempt to identify regulatory differences and infer global patterns of change in gene expression across species. Here, we review studies that used genome-wide ChIP to study the evolution of enhancers. The trend is one of high divergence of cis-regulatory elements between species, possibly compensated by extensive creation and loss of regulatory elements and rewiring of their target genes. We speculate on the meaning of the differences observed and discuss that although ChIP experiments identify the biochemical event of protein-DNA interaction, it cannot determine whether the event results in a biological function, and therefore more studies are required to establish the effect of divergence of binding events on species-specific gene expression."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "However, existing models specifically designed for regulatory sequences consider the independent evolution of individual transcription factor (TF)-binding sites, ignoring that the function and evolution of a binding site depends on its context, typically the cis-regulatory module (CRM) in which the site is located", "answer_start": 70}], "question": "Are human enhancers or promoters evolving faster?", "id": "5ac3699f0340b9f058000001_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "There is growing interest in models of regulatory sequence evolution. However, existing models specifically designed for regulatory sequences consider the independent evolution of individual transcription factor (TF)-binding sites, ignoring that the function and evolution of a binding site depends on its context, typically the cis-regulatory module (CRM) in which the site is located. Moreover, existing models do not account for the gene-specific roles of TF-binding sites, primarily because their roles often are not well understood. We introduce two models of regulatory sequence evolution that address some of the shortcomings of existing models and implement simulation frameworks based on them. One model simulates the evolution of an individual binding site in the context of a CRM, while the other evolves an entire CRM. Both models use a state-of-the art sequence-to-expression model to predict the effects of mutations on the regulatory output of the CRM and determine the strength of selection. We use the new framework to simulate the evolution of TF-binding sites in 37 well-studied CRMs belonging to the anterior-posterior patterning system in Drosophila embryos. We show that these simulations provide accurate fits to evolutionary data from 12 Drosophila genomes, which includes statistics of binding site conservation on relatively short evolutionary scales and site loss across larger divergence times. The new framework allows us, for the first time, to test hypotheses regarding the underlying cis-regulatory code by directly comparing the evolutionary implications of the hypothesis with the observed evolutionary dynamics of binding sites. Using this capability, we find that explicitly modeling self-cooperative DNA binding by the TF Caudal (CAD) provides significantly better fits than an otherwise identical evolutionary simulation that lacks this mechanistic aspect. This hypothesis is further supported by a statistical analysis of the distribution of intersite spacing between adjacent CAD sites. Experimental tests confirm direct homodimeric interaction between CAD molecules as well as self-cooperative DNA binding by CAD. We note that computational modeling of the D. melanogaster CRMs alone did not yield significant evidence to support CAD self-cooperativity. We thus demonstrate how specific mechanistic details encoded in CRMs can be revealed by modeling their evolution and fitting such models to multispecies data."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We summarize recent case studies and genome-wide investigations that have uncovered diverse mechanisms though which new enhancers arise", "answer_start": 325}], "question": "Are human enhancers or promoters evolving faster?", "id": "5ac3699f0340b9f058000001_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "A central goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the genetic origin of morphological novelties-i.e. anatomical structures unique to a taxonomic group.

Herein, tryptase-positive MCs were quantified in the intima and media of both unstable and stable atherosclerotic plaques in infarct-related and non-infarct-related coronary arteries.RESULTS: In the media of both acute and chronic MI patients, the number of MCs was significantly higher than in controls. This was also found when evaluating unstable and stable plaques separately. In patients with chronic MI, the number of MCs in unstable lesions was significantly higher than in stable lesions. This coincided with a significant increase in the relative number of unstable plaques in patients with chronic MI compared with control and acute MI. No differences in MC density were found between infarct-related and non-infarct-related coronary arteries in patients with MI.CONCLUSION: The presence of MCs in the media of both stable and unstable atherosclerotic coronary lesions after MI suggests that MCs may be involved in the onset of MI and, on the other hand, that MI triggers intra-plaque infiltration of MCs especially in unstable plaques, possibly increasing the risk of re-infarction.Copyright © 2016 Japanese College of Cardiology.

Moreover, we observed that the transglutaminase coagulation factor XIIIA (FXIIIA) was one of the most abundant proteins contained in the BMCMC releasates. Mast cell-deficient mice exhibited increased FXIIIA plasma and activity levels as well as reduced bleeding times, indicating that mast cells are more efficient in their ability to downregulate FXIIIA than in contributing to its amounts and functions in homeostatic conditions. We found that human chymase and mouse mast cell protease-4 (the mouse homologue of human chymase) had the ability to reduce FXIIIA levels and function via proteolytic degradation.

Moreover, MC reactivity to gliadin and its peptides was characterized by using in vitro assays.RESULTS: Infiltrating MCs were associated with the severity of mucosal damage, and their numbers were increased in patients with higher Marsh scores. MCs were found to directly respond to nonimmunodominant gliadin fragments by releasing proinflammatory mediators.

This heterogeneity can express itself as differences in histochemical, biochemical, and functional characteristics. In vitro systems provided a powerful tool for the investigation of the basic mechanisms for mast cell development and differentiation and helped to demonstrate that mast cell heterogeneity can be traced back to certain cytokine patterns that are present in different microenvironments. In this context it has also been shown that the growth factors required for human mast cell differentiation are somewhat different than those for rodents. In rodents, the atypical, T cell-dependent mucosal type mast cell can be distinguished from the T cell-independent connective tissue-type mast cell. In humans, the strict classification into mucosal and connective tissue-type mast cells is not possible and the content of mast cell-specific proteases chymase and tryptase is the main criterion for mast cell subtypes in humans.

The functional roles of mast cell in vivo have been principally characterized by comparing the biological responses in mast cell-deficient mice (WBB6F(1)-W/W(v)), their normal wild-type littermates (WBB6F(1)-+/+) and mast cell deficient mice reconstituted locally or systemically with mast cells cultured from the bone marrow cells of WBB6F(1)-+/+ mice (WBB6F(1)-W/W(v)+MC). Recently investigators have demonstrated that mast cell-deficient mice (WBB6F(1)-W/W(v)) can be reconstituted with mast cells derived in vitro from the bone marrow cells of certain gene knock-out mice or genetically-manipulated embryonic stem cells. This novel approach of analyzing the biological consequences of gene mutations in mast cells will help us to better understand the role of individual gene products in mast cell responses.

It has previously been suggested that after IgE-mediated degranulation mast cells can undergo regranulation. Such a process is probably of great importance with respect to the severity and perpetuation of the allergic response.OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate whether mast cells recover from degranulation and whether they still have the potential to release a granule-associated mediator and upregulate certain cytokine genes.METHODS: Mouse mast cells were repeatedly activated by IgE and specific antigen with a 24-hour or 48-hour interval. During each of the 2 activation stages, release of beta-hexosaminidase was measured by means of enzymatic colorimetric analysis, and IL-13 and IL-6 mRNA was detected by ribonuclease protection assay. Both scanning electron microscopy and time-lapse photography were used to reveal the process of mast cell recovery.RESULTS: We found that re-activation of degranulated mast cells in response to high-affinity IgE-receptor cross-linkage triggers beta-hexosaminidase release and upregulation of IL-13 and IL-6 gene expression levels similar to what is seen in the initial activation. Scanning electron microscopy documented cells at various stages during the recovery process 30 minutes after the activation. With time-lapse photography, a single cell that had undergone degranulation could be visualized consecutively during its recovery process.CONCLUSION: Mast cells can recover after an IgE-mediated activation and can repeatedly release beta-hexosaminidase and express IL-6 and IL-13 mRNA after re-activation."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Several chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with increased mast cell numbers and upregulation of the TNF receptor family member CD30, but the role of elevated CD30 expression is poorly understood.", "answer_start": 149}], "question": "What biologic process in the body is associated with Mast cells?", "id": "5aac543bfcf4565872000004_018", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Mast cells are involved in many disorders where the triggering mechanism that leads to degranulation and/or cytokine secretion has not been defined.

Here we report what we believe to be a novel way to activate mast cells with CD30 that leads to degranulation-independent secretion of chemokines. CD30 induced a de novo synthesis and secretion of the chemokines IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-1beta, a process involving the MAPK/ERK pathway. Mast cells were found to be the predominant CD30 ligand-positive (CD30L-positive) cell in the chronic inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and both CD30 and CD30L expression were upregulated in lesional skin in these conditions. Furthermore, the number of IL-8-positive mast cells was elevated both in psoriatic and atopic dermatitis lesional skin as well as in ex vivo CD30-treated healthy skin organ cultures. In summary, characterization of CD30 activation of mast cells has uncovered an IgE-independent pathway that is of importance in understanding the entirety of the role of mast cells in diseases associated with mast cells and CD30 expression.

The study of genetic variation in parasites is important for a better understanding of the biology, population genetics, and ultimately the evolution and epidemiology of these organisms. Very few attempts have been made to characterize genetic polymorphisms of parasites isolated from Panamanian patients of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Here we present data on the genetic variability of local isolates of Leishmania, as well as specimens from several other species, by means of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP), a technique seldom used to study genetic makeup of parasites. We demonstrate that this technique allows detection of very high levels of genetic variability in local isolates of Leishmania panamensis in a highly reproducible manner. The analysis of AFLP fingerprints generated by unique selective primer combinations in L. panamensis suggests a predominant clonal mode of reproduction. Using fluorescently labeled primers, many taxon-specific fragments were identified which may show potential as species diagnostic fragments. The AFLP permitted a high resolution genetic analysis of the Leishmania genus, clearly separating certain groups among L. panamensis specimens and highly related species such as L. panamensis and L. guyanensis.

Together with previous studies on resistance of L. donovani against pentavalent antimonials, these data suggest that the infectivity of the parasite, or related phenotypes, might be a more determinant factor for treatment failure in visceral leishmaniasis than drug susceptibility, warranting a reassessment of our current view on treatment failure and drug resistance in leishmaniasis and beyond.IMPORTANCE: The high miltefosine relapse rate poses a major challenge for the current Kala-Azar Elimination Program in the Indian subcontinent and other leishmaniasis control programs worldwide. This relapse rate could not be related to reinfection, drug-resistant parasites, or reduced treatment quality.

These results supplement those obtained with antimonial-resistant L. donovani where an increased infectivity was also observed. This challenges the current view of Leishmania drug susceptibility being the biggest parasitic factor that contributes to treatment failure in leishmaniasis.

Early identification of the species that causes the initial cutaneous infection would greatly help to prevent mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, because it would allow more aggressive treatment and follow-up. However, because of the close genetic similarity of L. braziliensis and L. peruviana, there currently exists no simple assay to distinguish between these species.METHODS: We cloned the mannose phosphate isomerase gene from both L. braziliensis and L. peruviana. It is the only known isoenzyme capable of differentiating between L. braziliensis and L. peruviana in multilocus enzyme electrophoresis.

Brilliance 2 demonstrated growth at 1.5 × 10(1)cfu/mL for mecC MRSA but at a higher density (1.5 × 10(4)cfu/mL) for the three mecA MRSA strains. All four media demonstrated excellent sensitivity for MRSA detection (≥99%), but reduced levels of specificity (85-73%) when challenged with a range of meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates.

Therefore, we compared the in vivo efficacy of the combination of ampicillin plus sulbactam with that of vancomycin against ORSA strains. Also, the moderate resistance of BORSA strains appears to be attributable mainly to the hyperproduction of beta-lactamase. Therefore, we also studied the in vivo efficacy of ampicillin plus sulbactam against such organisms. Experimental aortic endocarditis was induced in rabbits by the following three strains: beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strain VP-986, beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain 67-0, and its beta-lactamase-negative clone. In animals with BORSA endocarditis, ampicillin plus sulbactam and oxacillin were highly effective in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities, with each being significantly better than either ampicillin alone or no therapy. In animals with endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain, ampicillin plus sulbactam was significantly better at reducing mean vegetation bacterial densities than the other regimens. For endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-negative ORSA clone, ampicillin was better than vancomycin in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities. These data show that infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strains respond therapeutically in a manner similar to that of infections caused by oxacillin-susceptible strains, with both oxacillin and ampicillin plus sulbactam being highly efficacious.

However, the approval of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has shifted the treatment paradigm and provides hope for improved survival. The ability of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to evade the host immune system can be overcome by agents such as pembrolizumab (MK-3475/lambrolizumab), which is a monoclonal antibody targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. In early studies, treatment with pembrolizumab led to dramatic and durable responses in select patients (PD-L1+ tumors). This remarkable efficacy lead to approval of pembrolizumab in the second-line setting as response rates were almost doubled compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. Most recently, data in the first-line setting from the KEYNOTE-024 study have redefined the SOC therapy for a selected subset of patients. In patients with ≥50% PD-L1+ tumors, pembrolizumab had a clear progression-free survival and overall survival benefit. Toxicity was mostly immune related and similar to checkpoint blockade toxicities observed in previous studies. The initial approval and subsequent studies of pembrolizumab required and utilized a companion diagnostic test, Dako's IHC 22C3, to assess PD-L1 status of patients. The evaluation and scoring system of this assay has been used by other companies as a reference to develop their own assays, which may complicate selection of patients. Finally, the impact of pembrolizumab in NSCLC is growing as evidenced by the numerous, ongoing trials open for combinations with chemotherapy, chemoradiation, other immunotherapeutics, immunomodulators, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Further studies are also evaluating pembrolizumab in small-cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma.

In an effort to identify other likely sites for transposon integration, a hidden Markov model of the consensus target insertion site was derived from the Tn916-H. influenzae junction fragments and searched against the entire genome. Eighty percent of the 30 highest-scoring predicted Tn916 target sites were from intergenic, nonprotein-coding regions of the genome.

Duplication mechanisms include small-scale, or \"local\", events such as unequal crossing over and retroposition, together with global events, such as chromosomal or whole genome duplication (WGD). In particular, different studies confirmed that the yeast S. cerevisiae arose from a 100-150 million-year old whole-genome duplication. Detection and study of duplications are usually based on sequence alignment, synteny and phylogenetic techniques, but protein domains are also useful in assessing protein homology. We develop a simple and computationally efficient protein domain architecture comparison method based on the domain assignments available from public databases. We test the accuracy and the reliability of this method in detecting instances of gene duplication in the yeast S. cerevisiae. In particular, we analyze the evolution of WGD and non-WGD paralogs from the domain viewpoint, in comparison with a more standard functional analysis of the genes. A large number of domains is shared by genes that underwent local and global duplications, indicating the existence of a common set of \"duplicable\" domains. On the other hand, WGD and non-WGD paralogs tend to have different functions. We find evidence that this comes from functional migration within similar domain superfamilies, but also from the existence of small sets of WGD and non-WGD specific domain superfamilies with largely different functions. This observation gives a novel perspective on the finding that WGD paralogs tend to be functionally different from small-scale paralogs. WGD and non-WGD superfamilies carry distinct functions. Finally, the Gene Ontology similarity of paralogs tends to decrease with duplication age, while this tendency is weaker or not observable by the comparison of the domain architectures of paralogs. This suggests that the set of domains composing a protein tends to be maintained, while its function, cellular process or localization diversifies. Overall, the gathered evidence gives a different viewpoint on the biological specificity of the WGD and at the same time points out the validity of domain architecture comparison as a tool for detecting homology."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "The two genomes are related by a 1:2 mapping, with each region of K. waltii corresponding to two regions of S. cerevisiae, as expected for whole-genome duplication.", "answer_start": 487}], "question": "How many genes in S. cerevisiae are the result of an ancient whole genome duplication?", "id": "5c2f669e133db5eb78000031_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Whole-genome duplication followed by massive gene loss and specialization has long been postulated as a powerful mechanism of evolutionary innovation.

The first patient presented with anemia and abdominal pain. The lead level was 74μg/dL and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin was 163μg/dL. She was treated with intravenous calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaNa2EDTA) and later with oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) with a good evolution.

We performed haploid genetic screens to identify factors regulating GPI-inositol deacylation, identifying seven genes. In particular, calnexin cycle impairment caused inefficient GPI-inositol deacylation. Calnexin was specifically associated with GPI-APs, dependent on N-glycan and GPI moieties, and assisted efficient GPI-inositol deacylation by PGAP1. Under chronic ER stress caused by misfolded GPI-APs, inositol-acylated GPI-APs were exposed on the cell surface.

Epigenetic alteration can be the net result of preceding infections, medication, diet, and/or other environmental influences.

Several thermodynamic parameters for the reaction were determined or calculated, including the overall equilibrium constant (K(eq) = 84) and the apparent equilibrium constant of the internal step (K(int) = 4) which involves the rate-determining interconversion of central complexes. A large (100-fold) difference in Vmax accounts for nucleotide specificity (ATP vs CTP), despite an only 3-fold difference in Km. Comparison of the sulfur elemental effect on Vmax for ATP and CTP suggests that the chemical step is rate-determining for both reactions. Comparison of the sulfur elemental effect on Vmax/Km revealed differences in the mechanism by which either nucleotide is incorporated. Consistent with these data, an induced fit mechanism for nucleotide specificity is proposed whereby PAP couples a uniform binding mechanism, which selects for ATP, with a ground-state destabilization mechanism, which serves to accelerate the velocity for the correct substrate."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "As a potent and selective drug, brigatinib exhibits high efficacy against wild-type and mutant anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) proteins to treat non-small cell lung cancer.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time-of-flight / time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were used for analyzing peptide mass signals and amino acid sequences of digested TFF peptides.RESULTS: MALDI-TOF/TOF analyses demonstrated that Kgp, RgpB, and trypsin were able to cleave TFF1 and TFF2 peptides, resulting in different patterns of digested fragments.

Purified gingipains and P. gingivalis whole cells were used to digest selected substrates including human hemoglobin in the presence or absence of peptide acceptors. Mass spectrometric analysis of the substrates digested with gingipains in the presence of GlyGly showed that transpeptidation outcompeted hydrolysis, whereas the trypsin-digested controls exhibited predominantly hydrolysis activity. The transpeptidation levels increased with increasing concentration of GlyGly. Purified gingipains and whole cells exhibited extensive transpeptidation activities on human hemoglobin. All hemoglobin cleavage sites were found to be suitable for GlyGly transpeptidation, and this transpeptidation enhanced hemoglobin digestion. The transpeptidation products were often more abundant than the corresponding hydrolysis products. In the absence of GlyGly, hemoglobin peptides produced during digestion were utilized as acceptors leading to the detection of up to 116 different transpeptidation products in a single reaction. P. gingivalis cells were able to digest hemoglobin faster when acceptor peptides derived from human serum albumin were included in the reaction, suggesting that gingipain-catalyzed transpeptidation may be relevant for substrates encountered in vivo.

Porphyromonas gingivalis expresses several proteinaceous hemin-binding sites, which are important in the binding/transport of heme/hemin from the host.

The NeuroBlate® System (Monteris Medical, MN, USA) was used to conform the thermal burn to the corpus callosum along the trajectory of the probe. The distance of the ideal entry site from either the coronal suture and the torcula or nasion and the midline was calculated. The distance of the probe tip from the dorsal and ventral limits of the callosotomy in the sagittal plane were also calculated.RESULTS: Anterior two-thirds callosotomy was possible in all patients using a posterior parieto-occipital paramedian trajectory through the non-dominant lobe. The average entry point was 3.64 cm from the midline, 10.6 cm behind the coronal suture, and 9.2 cm above the torcula. The probe tip was an average of 1.4 cm from the anterior commissure. For a total callosotomy, an additional contralaterally placed frontal probe was used to target the posterior one-third of the corpus callosum.

Volumetric analysis was performed to determine the extent-of-coverage of tumor volume by TDT lines. Patient outcomes were evaluated statistically. LITT was delivered as upfront in 19 and delivered as salvage in 16 cases. After 7.2 months of follow-up, 71% of cases demonstrated progression and 34% died. The median overall survival (OS) for the cohort was not reached; however, the 1-year estimate of OS was 68 ± 9%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.1 months. Thirteen cases who met the following two criteria-(1) <0.05 cm(3) tumor volume not covered by the yellow TDT line and (2) <1.5 cm(3) additional tumor volume not covered by the blue TDT line-had better PFS than the other 21 cases (9.7 vs. 4.6 months; P = 0.02).

The NeuroBlate System incorporates several technological advances to overcome these drawbacks. The authors report a Phase I, thermal dose-escalation trial assessing the safety and efficacy of NeuroBlate in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (rGBM).METHODS: Adults with suspected supratentorial rGBM of 15- to 40-mm dimension and a Karnofsky Performance Status score of ≥ 60 were eligible. After confirmatory biopsy, treatment was delivered using a rigid, gas-cooled, side-firing laser probe. Treatment was monitored using real-time MRI thermometry, and proprietary software providing predictive thermal damage feedback was used by the surgeon, along with control of probe rotation and depth, to tailor tissue coagulation. An external data safety monitoring board determined if toxicity at lower levels justified dose escalation.RESULTS: Ten patients were treated at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals-Case Medical Center). Their average age was 55 years (range 34-69 years) and the median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status score was 80 (range 70-90). The mean tumor volume was 6.8 ± 5 cm(3) (range 2.6-19 cm(3)), the percentage of tumor treated was 78% ± 12% (range 57%-90%), and the conformality index was 1.21 ± 0.33 (range 1.00-2.04). Treatment-related necrosis was evident on MRI studies at 24 and 48 hours. The median survival was 316 days (range 62-767 days). Three patients improved neurologically, 6 remained stable, and 1 worsened. Steroid-responsive treatment-related edema occurred in all patients but one. Three had Grade 3 adverse events at the highest dose.CONCLUSIONS: NeuroBlate represents new technology for delivering laser interstitial thermal therapy, allowing controlled thermal ablation of deep hemispheric rGBM.

Caplacizumab's effect on major thromboembolic (TE) events, exacerbations and death was studied. Fewer caplacizumab-treated patients had a major TE event, an exacerbation, or died versus placebo. Caplacizumab has the potential to reduce the acute morbidity and mortality associated with aTTP.SUMMARY: Background Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is a life-threatening autoimmune thrombotic microangiopathy. In spite of treatment with plasma exchange and immunosuppression, patients remain at risk for thrombotic complications, exacerbations, and death. In the phase II TITAN study, treatment with caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody® was shown to reduce the time to confirmed platelet count normalization and exacerbations during treatment. Objective The clinical benefit of caplacizumab was further investigated in a post hoc analysis of the incidence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations during the study drug treatment period and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-related death during the study. Methods The Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query (SMQ) for 'embolic and thrombotic events' was run to investigate the occurrence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations in the safety population of the TITAN study, which consisted of 72 patients, of whom 35 received caplacizumab and 37 received placebo. Results Four events (one pulmonary embolism and three aTTP exacerbations) were reported in four patients in the caplacizumab group, and 20 such events were reported in 14 patients in the placebo group (two acute myocardial infarctions, one ischemic stroke, one hemorrhagic stroke, one pulmonary embolism, one deep vein thrombosis, one venous thrombosis, and 13 aTTP exacerbations). Two of the placebo-treated patients died from aTTP during the study. Conclusion In total, 11.4% of caplacizumab-treated patients and 43.2% of placebo-treated patients experienced one or more major thromboembolic events, experienced an exacerbation, or died. This analysis shows the potential for caplacizumab to reduce the risk of major thromboembolic morbidities and mortality associated with aTTP.© 2017 The Authors.

Commercialization of camelid sdAbs exploded in 2001 with a flurry of patents issued to the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and later taken on by the Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) and, after 2002, the VIB-founded spin-off company, Ablynx.

Several pathologic processes can produce this syndrome, but neurodegeneration accompanied by neuronal inclusions composed of α-synuclein (Lewy bodies) is considered the typical pathologic correlate of PD.METHODS: The neuropathologic features of PD are reviewed based upon personal experience and review of the literature. Molecular pathology of PD is summarized from cell biological and animal studies.RESULTS: The pathologic feature that correlates with signs and symptoms of PD is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra with dopaminergic denervation of the striatum. Neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra preferentially affects the ventrolateral cell group that projects to posterolateral putamen and is accompanied by formation of Lewy bodies composed of aggregated α-synuclein. Some patients with PD are found at autopsy to have other pathologic processes, such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and cerebrovascular disease (vascular Parkinsonism). The peripheral autonomic nervous system is also affected. The triggering event in PD is unknown, but recent studies suggest a role for loss of nuclear membrane integrity. Once α-synuclein aggregates forms, evidence supports cell-to-cell propagation.CONCLUSION: PD is a multisystem synucleinopathy caused by poorly characterized genetic and environmental factors that produces degeneration in selectively vulnerable neuronal populations.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The Lewy body was described in 1912, and the substantia nigra was found to be depigmented with neuronal loss and gliosis in 1919. The link between dopamine and PD began in 1957, 140 years after Parkinson's Essay. Arvid Carlsson and Oleh Hornykiewicz were the major pioneers. The revolutionary therapeutic breakthrough was the introduction of high dosage levodopa therapy by George Cotzias in 1967. Following 40 years of the dopa/dopamine era, we have entered the era of alpha-synuclein, the protein present in Lewy bodies. Heiko Braak found that alpha-synuclein accumulates initially in the olfactory system and lower brainstem and then travels in an anatomic pattern to involve other regions of the brain and thereby cause progressive symptoms. Alpha-synuclein was somehow converted to a rogue protein. Where this originates and how it is propagated are under intense investigation. At the same time that the alpha-synuclein era was developing, clinical advances took place by recognizing PD as hosting a wide variety of nonmotor features with eventual cognitive impairment in many. Therapeutics has also evolved. Although the most effective therapy for the motor features remains levodopa, surgical approaches and drugs for nonmotor problems continue to expand our ability to treat people with PD. We can expect therapeutic advances in neuroprotection as the basic science discoveries uncovered in the alpha-synuclein era are translated into effective treatments."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Lewy bodies comprise of aggregated intracellular vesicles and proteins and α-synuclein is reported to be a major protein component.

We have shown microtubule regression and mitochondrial and nuclear degradation in neurons with developing Lewy bodies. In PD, multiple Lewy bodies were often observed with α-synuclein interacting with DNA to cause marked nuclear degradation. In DLB, the mitochondria are drawn into the Lewy body and the mitochondrial integrity is lost. This work suggests that Lewy bodies are cytotoxic. In DLB, we suggest that microtubule regression and mitochondrial loss results in decreased cellular energy and axonal transport that leads to cell death.

Towards this end, the present study examined the effects of intracranial rotenone treatment on TH and α-synuclein immunohistochemistry in addition to forelimb motor function. Mice were unilaterally infused with either vehicle or rotenone (2μg/site) in both the medial forebrain bundle and the substantia nigra. The forelimb asymmetry (cylinder) test indicated a significant decrease in use of the contralateral forelimb in lesioned animals as compared to the sham group. Densitometric analysis revealed a significant depletion of TH immunofluorescence within the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra of lesioned animals.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to differentiate into endothelial lineage cells, which makes them attractive candidates for therapeutic angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate efficient differentiation of MSCs into ECs by inducing medium in vitro.METHODS: MSCs were isolated from bone marrow by density gradient centrifugation. The characterisation of the MSCs was determined by their cluster of differentiation (CD) marker profile. Inducing medium containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), ascorbic acid, and heparin was applied to differentiate the MSCs into ECs. Endothelial differentiation was quantitatively evaluated using flow cytometry. Real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyse mRNA expression of endothelial markers. Tube formation assay was further performed to examine the functional status of the differentiated MSCs.RESULTS: Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that CD31+ and CD34+ cells increased steadily from 12% at 3 days, to 40% at 7 days, and to 60% at 14 days. Immunofluorescence staining further confirmed the expression of CD31 and CD34. qRT-PCR showed that expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF), vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) were significantly higher in the induced MSCs group compared with the uninduced MSCs group. The functional behavior of the differentiated cells was tested by tube formation assay in vitro on matrigel. Induced MSCs were capable of developing capillary networks, and progressive formation of vessel like structures was associated with increased EC population.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a method to efficiently promote differentiation of MSCs into ECs in vitro for potential application in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease.Copyright © 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery.

IL-17A may enhance neuroinflammation via its IL-17A receptor, i.e. IL-17RA expressed in immune cells (such as monocytes) of autistic children. Increased oxidative stress has been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. However, whether IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling contributes to oxidative inflammation in monocytes of autistic children has not been explored previously. With this background, we performed this study in peripheral monocytes of ASD patients and age-matched typically developing children. Our study shows that ASD individuals have increased IL-17RA expression in monocytes which is associated with increased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) pathway and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitrotyrosine expression as compared to typically developing children. Moreover, in vitro activation of IL-17 receptor by IL-17A in monocytes isolated from ASD individuals leads to enhanced iNOS expression via NFκB pathway. IL-17RA antibody treatment in vitro reversed IL-17A-induced increase in NFκB and iNOS/nitrotyrosine expression in monocytes isolated from ASD subjects. These data connect increased IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling in ASD patients with enhanced oxidative inflammation in monocytes. Therefore, IL-17 receptor signaling in monocytes may potentiate the effects of IL-17A released by other immune cells and may aggravate neuroinflammation in ASD.

We demonstrate that donor T cell-derived IL-22 significantly exacerbates cutaneous chronic GVHD and that IL-22 is produced by highly inflammatory donor CD4+ T cells posttransplantation. IL-22 and IL-17A derive from both independent and overlapping lineages, defined as T helper (Th)22 and IL-22+ Th17 cells.

In the clinic, high levels of both IL-17A and IL-22 expression are present in the skin of patients with GVHD after allo-SCT.

Furthermore, depletion of Esco2 causes a severely impaired spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, accompanied by the remarkably elevated incidence of defective kinetochore-microtubule attachments which consequently lead to the generation of aneuploid eggs. Notably, we find that the involvement of Esco2 in SAC and kinetochore functions is mediated by its binding to histone H4 and acetylation of H4K16 both in vivo and in vitro.

We previously reported that mTORC1 signaling was depressed and overall translation was reduced in RBS cells and zebrafish models for RBS. Treatment of RBS cells and zebrafish RBS models with L-leucine partially rescued mTOR function and protein synthesis, correlating with increased cell division and improved development.RESULTS: In this study, we use RBS cells to model mTORC1 repression and analyze transcription and translation with ribosome profiling to determine gene-level effects of L-leucine. L-leucine treatment partially rescued translational efficiency of ribosomal subunits, translation initiation factors, snoRNA production, and mitochondrial function in RBS cells, consistent with these processes being mTORC1 controlled. In contrast, other genes are differentially expressed independent of L-leucine treatment, including imprinted genes such as H19 and GTL2, miRNAs regulated by GTL2, HOX genes, and genes in nucleolar associated domains.CONCLUSIONS: Our study distinguishes between gene expression changes in RBS cells that are TOR dependent and those that are independent. Some of the TOR independent gene expression changes likely reflect the architectural role of cohesin in chromatin looping and gene expression. This study reveals the dramatic rescue effects of L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 in RBS cells and supports that normal gene expression and translation requires ESCO2 function."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Protein carbonylation, a chemically diverse oxidative post-translational modification, is widely considered as the biomarker for oxidative stress and protein damage.

The disease is vaccine preventable and eradication of the virus is considered feasible, in principle.

Declining disease prevalence, combined with public anxiety over the vaccination's safety, has led to increased vaccine refusal, especially in Europe. This has led to the resurgence of measles in some areas.AREAS COVERED: This article discusses whether synergizing effective measles therapeutics with the measles vaccination could contribute to finally eradicating measles. The authors identify key elements in a desirable drug profile and review current disease management strategies and the state of experimental inhibitor candidates. The authors also evaluate the risk associated with viral escape from inhibition, and consider the potential of measles therapeutics in the management of persistent central nervous system (CNS) viral infection. Finally, the authors contemplate the possible impact of therapeutics in controlling the threat imposed by closely related zoonotic pathogens of the same genus as measles.EXPERT OPINION: Efficacious therapeutics used for post-exposure prophylaxis of high-risk social contacts of confirmed index cases may aid measles eradication by closing herd immunity gaps; this is due to vaccine refusal or failure in populations with overall good vaccination coverage. The envisioned primarily prophylactic application of measles therapeutics to a predominantly pediatric and/or adolescent population, dictates the drug profile.

Weighted TFBS contributions to putative gene regulation are integrated to derive an NF-κB gene network. A de novo motif enrichment analysis uncovers secondary TFBSs (AP1, SP1) at characteristic distances from NF-κB/RelA TFBSs. Comparison with experimental ENCODE ChIP-Seq data indicates that experimental TFBSs highly correlate with predicted sites.

Sixteen novel NF-κB/RelA-regulated genes and TFBSs were experimentally validated, including TANK, a negative feedback gene whose expression is NF-κB/RelA dependent and requires a functional interaction with the AP1 TFBSs. Our probabilistic method yields more accurate NF-κB/RelA-regulated networks than a traditional, distance-based approach, confirmed by both analysis of gene expression and increased informativity of Genome Ontology annotations.

However, since the first description of POEM in 2010, this technique has widely disseminated, despite the absence of long-term results and randomized trials.METHODS: A systematic Medline literature search of articles on LHM and POEM for the treatment of achalasia was performed. The main outcomes measured were improvement of dysphagia and posttreatment gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Linear regression was used to model the effect of each procedure on the different outcomes.RESULTS: Fifty-three studies reported data on LHM (5834 patients), and 21 articles examined POEM (1958 patients). Mean follow-up was significantly longer for studies of LHM (41.5 vs. 16.2 mo, P < 0.0001). Predicted probabilities for improvement in dysphagia at 12 months were 93.5% for POEM and 91.0% for LHM (P = 0.01), and at 24 months were 92.7% for POEM and 90.0% for LHM (P = 0.01).

In the present study, ASI was found to ameliorate the progression and hamper the recurrence of EAE effectively in the treatment regimens. It significantly reduced the demyelination and inflammatory infiltration of CNS in EAE mice by suppressing the percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells, which was closely associated with the inhibition of JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways. ASI also increased the percentage of Treg cells in spleen and CNS, which was accompanied by elevated Foxp3.

In the present study we have developed a dual strategy for evaluating cystinosin function that is amenable to rapid genetic analysis. We show that human cystinosin expressed in this yeast confers growth on cystine when the protein is mistargeted to the plasma membrane by the deletion of the C-terminal targeting signal, GYQDL. We also screened a vacuolar protein sorting deletion library, and subsequently created multiple vps deletion mutants for kinetic studies. The double deletion, vps1Δvps17Δ, greatly enhanced uptake. This enabled validation by kinetic studies, including first studies on the WT CTNS protein (that contained the GYQDL motif). Using this screen we isolated several gain of function mutants, G131S/D, G309S/D, A137V, G197R, S270T, L274F and S312N showing enhanced growth on low concentrations of cystine. Kinetic analysis yielded insights into the role of the residues (including one of the patient mutations, G197R).

Hypoxia, lactate, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or combinations were selected to mimic the TME. To investigate this, NK cells from healthy donors were isolated and NK cell ADCC capacity in response to MM cells was assessed in flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity and degranulation (CD107a) assays in the presence of TME factors. Hypoxia, lactate and PGE2 reduced cytotoxicity of NK cells against myeloma target cells. The addition of daratumumab (anti-CD38 antibody) augmented NK-cell cytotoxicity against target cells expressing high CD38, but not against CD38 low or negative target cells also in the presence of TME. Co-staining for inhibitory KIRs and NKG2A demonstrated that daratumumab enhanced degranulation of all NK cell subsets. Nevertheless, KIR-ligand mismatched NK cells were slightly better effector cells than KIR-ligand matched NK cells. In summary, our study shows that combination therapy using strategies to maximize activating NK cell signaling by triggering ADCC in combination with an approach to minimize inhibitory signaling through a selection of KIR-ligand mismatched donors, can help to overcome the NK-suppressive TME.

PAI-1 expression is increased in both experimental APAP-induced liver injury and patients with acute liver failure. Prior studies have shown that PAI-1 prevents intrahepatic hemorrhage and mortality after APAP challenge, but the downstream mechanisms are not clear. We tested the hypothesis that PAI-1 limits liver-related morbidity after APAP challenge by reducing tPA-dependent fibrinolysis. Compared with APAP-challenged (300 mg/kg) wild-type mice, hepatic deposition of cross-linked fibrin was reduced, with intrahepatic congestion and hemorrhage increased in PAI-1-deficient mice 24 hours after APAP overdose. Administration of recombinant wild-type human PAI-1 reduced intrahepatic hemorrhage 24 hours after APAP challenge in PAI-1-/- mice, whereas a mutant PAI-1 lacking antiprotease function had no effect. Of interest, tPA deficiency alone did not affect APAP-induced liver damage. In contrast, fibrinolysis, intrahepatic congestion and hemorrhage, and mortality driven by PAI-1 deficiency were reduced in APAP-treated tPA-/-/PAI-1-/- double-knockout mice.

Highly induced during luteolysis, it acts as a natural anti-angiogenic, proapoptotic compound. THBS1 expression is regulated in bovine luteal endothelial cells (LECs) by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) acting in an opposite manner. Here we sought to identify specific microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting THBS1 and investigate their possible involvement in FGF2 and TGFB1-mediated THBS1 expression. Several miRNAs predicted to target THBS1 mRNA (miR-1, miR-18a, miR-144, miR-194, and miR-221) were experimentally tested. Of these, miR-221 was shown to efficiently target THBS1 expression and function in LECs. We found that this miRNA is highly expressed in luteal cells and in mid-cycle CL. Consistent with the inhibition of THBS1 function, miR-221 also reduced Serpin Family E Member 1 [SERPINE1] in LECs and promoted angiogenic characteristics of LECs. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the gene product of SERPINE1, inhibited cell adhesion, suggesting that PAI-1, like THBS1, has anti-angiogenic properties. Importantly, FGF2, which negatively regulates THBS1, elevates miR-221. Conversely, TGFB1 that stimulates THBS1, significantly reduces miR-221. Furthermore, FGF2 enhances the suppression of THBS1 caused by miR-221 mimic, and prevents the increase in THBS1 induced by miR-221 inhibitor. In contrast, TGFB1 reverses the inhibitory effect of miR-221 mimic on THBS1, and enhances the upregulation of THBS1 induced by miR-221 inhibitor. These data support the contention that FGF2 and TGFB1 modulate THBS1 via miR-221. These in vitro data propose that dynamic regulation of miR-221 throughout the cycle, affecting THBS1 and SERPINE1, can modulate vascular function in the CL."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a crucial regulator of fibrinolysis, is increased in sepsis, but its values in predicting disease severity or mortality outcomes have been controversial", "answer_start": 12}], "question": "What is the function of Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1?", "id": "5c5f264b1a4c55d80b00001e_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Objectives: Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a crucial regulator of fibrinolysis, is increased in sepsis, but its values in predicting disease severity or mortality outcomes have been controversial.

DA chemotherapy and GO as separate treatments reduced AML burden but left significant chemoresidual disease in multiple AML models. The combination of GO and DA chemotherapy eliminated nearly all AML burden and extended overall survival. In two small subsets of AML models, chemoresidual disease following DA chemotherapy displayed hallmark markers of leukemic LICs (CLL1 and CD34). In vivo, the two chemoresistant subpopulations (CLL1+/CD117- and CD34+/CD38+) showed higher ability to self-renewal than their counterpart subpopulations, respectively. CD33 was coexpressed in these functional LIC subpopulations. We demonstrate that the GO and DA induction chemotherapy combination more effectively eliminates LICs in AML PDX models than either single agent alone.

It results clinically in cramps and fasciculations. It is not specific to motor neuron diseases, and can occur in healthy subjects, as well as in various pathologies of the peripheral nervous system, including nerve hyperexcitability syndromes. Hyperexcitability plays an important and debated role in the pathophysiology of motor neuron diseases, especially in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The mechanisms causing hyperexcitability are not yet clearly identified. While most studies favor a distal axonal origin site of fasciculations, some of the fasciculations could be of cortical origin. The consequences of hyperexcitability are also discussed, whether it is rather protective or deleterious in the disease course. Fasciculations are depicted both clinically and using electromyogram, and more recently the interest of ultrasound has been highlighted. The importance of fasciculation potentials in the diagnosis of ALS led to changes in electrophysiological criteria at Awaji consensus conference. The contribution of these modifications to ALS diagnosis has been the subject of several studies. In clinical practice, it is necessary to distinguish fasciculations potentials of motor neuron disease from benign fasciculations. In most studies of fasciculation potentials in ALS, the presence of complex fasciculation potentials appears to be relevant for the diagnosis and the prognosis of the disease."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In 2006, the Awaji criteria for the diagnosis of ALS were proposed, adding two major points to the diagnostic criteria: electromyography is considered equivalent to clinical examination for the identification of LMN signs and fasciculation potentials resume their prominent place in the diagnosis.", "answer_start": 554}], "question": "Which disease can be classified with the Awaji Criteria?", "id": "5c61d278e842deac67000005_013", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common motor neuron disorder in adults. Although the diagnosis appears obvious in theory, clinical practice shows the contrary as diagnosis is delayed in many patients; the average time between symptom onset and diagnosis can reach 12 months. The delay can be explained by the variability of the clinical presentation and by the absence of diagnostic markers. In order to standardize diagnosis for enrollment in clinical research, diagnostic criteria for ALS were created and revisited during the last 20 years. In 2006, the Awaji criteria for the diagnosis of ALS were proposed, adding two major points to the diagnostic criteria: electromyography is considered equivalent to clinical examination for the identification of LMN signs and fasciculation potentials resume their prominent place in the diagnosis. Comparisons of the accuracy of the revisited El Escorial and Awaji criteria support improved diagnostic sensitivity without any effect on specificity with the new classification. The only weakness of the new classification involves patients with UMN signs in one region and LMN in two regions; these patients were previously classified as laboratory-supported probable ALS and currently as possible ALS, a lower level of diagnostic certainty. In all other instances the accuracy appears to be improved by the Awaji criteria. Nevertheless, there is a body of evidence suggesting the need for a revision of these new criteria, giving more weight to clinical and complementary findings of UMN involvement.

Recent outbreaks in Amish communities include a 2014 measles outbreak in Ohio, resulting in 368 cases reported. A recent outbreak of pertussis in an Amish community in Ohio resulted in the death of a 6-week-old Amish baby.METHODS: A study was designed to determine the knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and opinions of Amish parents relative to the immunization of Amish children.

The questionnaire, a copy of the current immunization schedule, and a return stamped envelope were also included in the mailed packet. The study sample consisted of 84 Amish individuals who voluntarily filled out and returned questionnaires.RESULTS: The findings from the data analysis demonstrated that fear, especially concern over too many recommended immunizations and immunizations overwhelming the child's system, was the most frequent reported reasons for not having children immunized according to recommendations.CONCLUSIONS: Religious factors and access to care were not among reasons most reported.

At each IOP level, 3D OCT data were captured using an optical microangiography (OMAG) scanning protocol and then post-processed to obtain both structural and vascular images. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), respiratory rate, pulse and blood oxygen saturation were monitored non-invasively throughout each experiment. Ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) was calculated as the difference between MAP for each animal and IOP at each level. The capillary filling index (CFI), defined as the ratio of area occupied by functional capillary vessels to the total scan area but excluding relatively large vessels of >30μm, was calculated at each IOP level and analyzed using the OCTA angiograms. Relative CFI vs IOP was plotted for the group means. CFI vs OPP was plotted for every animal in each group and data from all animals were combined in a CFI vs OPP scatter plot comparing the two groups.RESULTS: The MAP in adult animals was 108±5mmHg (mean±SD), whereas this value in the elderly was 99±5mmHg. All other physiologic parameters for both age groups were uniform and stable. In elderly animals, significant reduction of the CFI was first noted at IOP 40mmHg, as opposed to 60mmHg in adult animals. Individual assessment of CFI as a function of OPP for adult animals revealed a consistent plateau until OPP reached between 40 and 60mmHg. Elderly individuals demonstrated greater variability, with many showing a beginning of gradual deterioration of CFI at an OPP as high as 80mmHg. Overall comparison of CFI vs OPP between the two groups was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to adults, some, but not all, elderly animals demonstrate a more rapid deterioration of CFI vs OPP.

At each IOP level, 3D OCT data were captured using an optical microangiography (OMAG) scanning protocol and then post-processed to obtain both structural and vascular images. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), respiratory rate, pulse and blood oxygen saturation were monitored non-invasively throughout each experiment. Ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) was calculated as the difference between MAP for each animal and IOP at each level. The capillary filling index (CFI), defined as the ratio of area occupied by functional capillary vessels to the total scan area but excluding relatively large vessels of >30μm, was calculated at each IOP level and analyzed using the OCTA angiograms. Relative CFI vs IOP was plotted for the group means. CFI vs OPP was plotted for every animal in each group and data from all animals were combined in a CFI vs OPP scatter plot comparing the two groups.RESULTS: The MAP in adult animals was 108±5mmHg (mean±SD), whereas this value in the elderly was 99±5mmHg. All other physiologic parameters for both age groups were uniform and stable. In elderly animals, significant reduction of the CFI was first noted at IOP 40mmHg, as opposed to 60mmHg in adult animals. Individual assessment of CFI as a function of OPP for adult animals revealed a consistent plateau until OPP reached between 40 and 60mmHg. Elderly individuals demonstrated greater variability, with many showing a beginning of gradual deterioration of CFI at an OPP as high as 80mmHg. Overall comparison of CFI vs OPP between the two groups was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to adults, some, but not all, elderly animals demonstrate a more rapid deterioration of CFI vs OPP. This suggests a reduced autoregulatory capacity that may contribute to increased glaucoma susceptibility in some older individuals. This variability must be considered when studying the relationship between IOP, ocular perfusion and glaucoma in elderly animal models.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Cochlear uptake of FITC-DEX was evaluated via immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry at 6 hours, and 3 and 7 days after the final injection.RESULTS: FITC-DEX uptake was evident in spiral ganglion cells (SGs), the organ of Corti (OC), and the lateral walls (LWs), the basal turns of which were stained relatively prominently in both groups. Animals receiving IP injections exhibited higher FITC-DEX uptakes by the SGs and OC, whereas IT injection triggered higher-level FITC-DEX accumulation by the OC and LWs. Flow cytometry revealed that intracochlear FITC-DEX uptake by IT-injected animals was higher and more prolonged than in animals subjected to IP injections.CONCLUSION: We thus describe differences in cochlear steroid distributions after systemic and IT injections.

Defects in lysosomal enzymes that hydrolyze sphingolipids have been relatively well studied. Gaucher disease is caused by the loss of activity of glucocerebrosidase, leading to accumulation of glucosylceramide. Gaucher disease exhibits a number of subtypes, with types 2 and 3 showing significant neuropathology. Sandhoff disease results from the defective activity of β-hexosaminidase, leading to accumulation of ganglioside GM2. Niemann-Pick type C disease is primarily caused by the loss of activity of the lysosomal membrane protein, NPC1, leading to storage of cholesterol and sphingosine. All three disorders display significant neuropathology, accompanied by neuroinflammation. It is commonly assumed that neuroinflammation is the result of infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the brain; for instance, cells resembling lipid-engorged macrophages ('Gaucher cells') have been observed in the brain of Gaucher disease patients. We now review the evidence that inflammatory macrophages are recruited into the brain in these diseases and then go on to provide some experimental data that, at least in the three mouse models tested, monocyte-derived macrophages do not appear to infiltrate the brain. Resident microglia, which are phenotypically distinct from infiltrating macrophages, are the only myeloid population present in significant numbers within the brain parenchyma in these authentic mouse models, even during the late symptomatic stages of disease when there is substantial neuroinflammation.

Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis of the metabolites showed clear separation of metabolomics profiles between normal and diseased individuals. Among these metabolites, dipeptides, amino acids and derivatives were elevated, indicating a robust protein catabolism. Through pathway enrichment analysis, we also found alterations in metabolites associated with neurotransmission, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulphate, key component of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was significantly elevated, which was also confirmed by biochemical assays.

Recent reports of transmission of lamivudine-resistant HBV in HIV patients are of especial concern, and large surveillance studies suggest that it may occur in up to 10% of new HBV infections in Western countries. Another worrisome aspect of the selection of lamivudine-resistant HBV is the potential for selection of vaccine escape mutants.

While pegIFN-alpha monotherapy for 1 year may be considered for HIV-HBV coinfected individuals with good spontaneous HIV control (elevated CD4 cell count, low plasma HIV-RNA), and certain HBV features (genotype A, HBeAg+, low serum HBV-DNA and elevated ALT), it is clear that very few coinfected patients fulfill these criteria. In HBeAg-negative HIV patients, adefovir may be an option but the relatively low antiviral potency of this drug discourages its wide use.

One of the 'five pillars' to achieve this goal is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is currently the only medication approved for PrEP. Despite its advantages, Truvada is costly and requires individuals to adhere to the once-daily regimen. To improve PrEP, many next-generation regimen, including long-acting formulations, are currently investigated. However, pre-clinical testing may not guide candidate selection, since it often fails to translate into clinical efficacy. On the other hand, quantifying prophylactic efficacy in the clinic is ethically problematic and requires to conduct long (years) and large (N>1000 individuals) trials, precluding systematic evaluation of candidates and deployment strategies. To prioritize- and help design PrEP regimen, tools are urgently needed that integrate pharmacological-, viral- and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy. Integrating the aforementioned factors, we developed an efficient and exact stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy, as an example for dolutegravir (DTG). Combining the population pharmacokinetics of DTG with the stochastic framework, we predicted that plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50- and 90% sexual transmissions respectively. We then predicted the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in PrEP, PrEP 'on demand' and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before/after virus exposure. Once daily PrEP with 50mg oral DTG prevented 99-100% infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP 'on demand' prevented 79-84% infections and PEP >80% when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. While the simulation framework can easily be adapted to other PrEP candidates, our simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada. Moreover, the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP; emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Truvada]) prevents HIV without penalizing sexual pleasure, and may even enhance pleasure (e.g., by reducing HIV-related anxiety).", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is the indication for Truvada?", "id": "5c5f29a81a4c55d80b00001f_010", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP; emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Truvada]) prevents HIV without penalizing sexual pleasure, and may even enhance pleasure (e.g., by reducing HIV-related anxiety).

The primary end point was the change from baseline to weeks 40 and 64 in the Thacher rickets severity total score (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity). In addition, the Radiographic Global Impression of Change was used to evaluate rachitic changes from baseline to week 40 and to week 64. Additional end points were changes in pharmacodynamic markers, linear growth, physical ability, and patient-reported outcomes and the incidence of adverse events.RESULTS: The mean Thacher rickets severity total score decreased from 1.9 at baseline to 0.8 at week 40 with every-2-week dosing and from 1.7 at baseline to 1.1 at week 40 with every-4-week dosing (P<0.001 for both comparisons); these improvements persisted at week 64. The mean serum phosphorus level increased after the first dose in both groups, and more than half the patients in both groups had levels within the normal range (3.2 to 6.1 mg per deciliter [1.0 to 2.0 mmol per liter]) by week 6. Stable serum phosphorus levels were maintained through week 64 with every-2-week dosing. Renal tubular phosphate reabsorption increased from baseline in both groups, with an overall mean increase of 0.98 mg per deciliter (0.32 mmol per liter). The mean dose of burosumab at week 40 was 0.98 mg per kilogram of body weight with every-2-week dosing and 1.50 mg per kilogram with every-4-week dosing. Across both groups, the mean serum alkaline phosphatase level decreased from 459 U per liter at baseline to 369 U per liter at week 64.

Chronic hypophosphatemia causes impaired mineralization of the bone matrix and results in rickets and osteomalacia. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone that regulates phosphate metabolism. FGF23 excess induces hypophosphatemia via impaired phosphate reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules and decreased phosphate absorption in the intestines. There are several types of genetic and acquired FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. Among these diseases, X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), which is caused by inactivating mutations in the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX) gene, is the most prevalent form of genetic FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets. Another clinically relevant form of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic disease is tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with FGF23-producing tumors. A combination of active vitamin D and phosphate salts is the current medical therapy used to treat patients with XLH and inoperative TIO. However, this therapy has certain efficacy- and safety-associated limitations. Several measures to inhibit FGF23 activity have been considered as possible new treatments for FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases.

The prototypic clinical phenotype of NFKB1-deficient patients includes common CVID features, such as hypogammaglobulinaemia and sinopulmonary infections, plus other highly variable individual manifestations. Here, we describe a patient with a profound CVID phenotype and severe gastrointestinal manifestations, including chronic and recurrent diarrhoea. Using an NGS customized panel of 323 genes related to primary immunodeficiencies, we identified a novel monoallelic loss-of-function mutation in NFKB1 leading to a truncated protein (c.1149delT/p.Gly384Glu ∗ 48). Interestingly, we also found a rare variant in NOD2 previously associated with Crohn's disease (p.His352Arg). Our patient had hypogammaglobulinaemia with a small number of B cells, most of which were naïve. The most noteworthy findings included marked skewing towards a Th1 phenotype in peripheral blood T cells and excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNFα). The patient's 6-year-old daughter, a carrier of the NFKB1 mutation, is clinically asymptomatic, but has started to show cellular and molecular changes. This case of NFKB1 deficiency appears to be a combination of immunodeficiency and a hyperinflammatory state. The current situation of the patient's daughter provides a glimpse of the preclinical phase of the condition."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "AFP serum were considered independent predictors for macrovascular invasion in HCC patients", "answer_start": 1432}], "question": "When is serum AFP used as marker?", "id": "5c7839edd774d04240000003_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Extremely poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with progressing disease was denoted by vascular invasion. Cytokeratin 18 (CK18) has been shown to be overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma so it is a valuable tumor marker; however, its role in vascular invasion is still unclear. This study aimed to predict CK18 as a predictive marker for macrovascular malignant invasion.METHODS: The present study was conducted on three groups of patients: group I included 91 HCC patients without macrovascular invasion, group II included 34 HCC patients with radiological evidence of vascular invasion, and group III included 110 control individuals subdivided into IIIA as healthy blood donors and IIIB as post-HCV cirrhotic patients without HCC.RESULTS: ROC curve of M30 fragments of CK18 was constructed for discrimination between HCC with and without macrovascular invasion. Optimum cutoff value was 304.5 ng/mL (AUC = 0.997, P < 0.001), sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98.8%). Regression analysis was conducted for prediction of macrovascular invasion within HCC patients. The following variables: higher levels of AST, M30, bilirubin, and AFP, lower levels of serum albumin, larger tumor size, child B score, and multiple lesions were associated with vascular invasion in univariate analysis. While in multivariate analysis, higher levels of AST and bilirubin and elevated levels of M30 and AFP serum were considered independent predictors for macrovascular invasion in HCC patients.CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that increased M30 fragments of CK18 levels may be useful as a possible marker of early tumor invasiveness."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Post-hepatectomy HLs of AFP and DCP are predictors of long-term outcome in patients with HCC.", "answer_start": 1444}], "question": "When is serum AFP used as marker?", "id": "5c7839edd774d04240000003_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "AIM: The prognostic significance of the half-lives (HLs) of α-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) in patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear.

We calculated the HLs of AFP and DCP from their values just before and 1 month after hepatectomy. We identified three groups: a normalization group, tumor marker concentrations within normal range 1 month post-hepatectomy; a long group, HL of AFP ≥7 days or DCP ≥4 days; and a short group, remaining patients.

Transfection efficiency was assessed with immunofluorescence, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. The downstream genes alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Jagged1 and the differentiation markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin (ALB), cytokeratin19 (CK19), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), and hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) were measured with qRT-PCR and western blotting.KEY FINDINGS: SpHBLV-CMVIE-TGF-β1, pHBLV-CMVIE-GFP, pHBLV-U6-TGF-β-R1 shRNA, and pHBLV-U6-RFP were successfully transfected. Over-expression of the TGF-β1 gene caused mHSCs to transform into myofibroblasts (MFs) and expression of Jagged1 and cholangiocyte markers (CK19, SOX9, Hes1) were significantly upregulated (P<0.01). Importantly, after blocking TGF-β1 signaling via gene silencing, expression of Jagged1 was much reduced, but the mature hepatocyte marker (ALB) was obviously increased. In addition, AFP, a hepatic stem cell marker, was expressed at the highest level in the control groups.SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings emphasize that the TGF-β1 signaling pathway regulates expression of Jagged1 in mHSCs which is associated with transformation of mHSCs into MFs, thus demonstrating a novel mechanism via which TGF-β1 signaling controls the differentiation fate of mHSCs through regulation of the Jagged1/Notch pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Participants received three doses of oral RV3-BB vaccine with the first dose given at 0-5 days after birth (neonatal schedule), or the first dose given at ∼8 weeks after birth (infant schedule), or placebo (placebo schedule). Stool samples from episodes of gastroenteritis were tested for rotavirus using EIA testing, positive samples were genotyped by RT-PCR. Full genome sequencing was performed on two representative rotavirus strains.RESULTS: There were 1110 episodes of acute gastroenteritis of any severity, 105 episodes were confirmed as rotavirus gastroenteritis by EIA testing. The most common genotype identified was G3P[8] (90/105), the majority (52/56) of severe (Vesikari score ≥11) rotavirus gastroenteritis episodes were due to the G3P[8] strain. Full genome analysis of two representative G3P[8] samples demonstrated the strain was an inter-genogroup reassortant, containing an equine-like G3 VP7, P[8] VP4 and a genogroup 2 backbone I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2. The complete genome of the Indonesian equine-like G3P[8] strain demonstrated highest genetic identity to G3P[8] strains circulating in Hungary and Spain.CONCLUSIONS: The dominant circulating strain during the Indonesian Phase IIb efficacy trial of the RV3-BB vaccine was an equine-like G3P[8] strain.

Until nowhearing loss has not been reported in individuals with SOX2 mutation. The results remind us that clinical anophthalmia may be accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss and may be associated with SOX2 mutation, and it will contribute to improving diagnosis and patient care.

Among enrolled patients harbouring TRK fusion-positive cancers, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2 (occurring in 21 [88%] of 24 patients); the most common larotrectinib-related adverse events of all grades were increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ten [42%] of 24 each), leucopenia (five [21%] of 24), decreased neutrophil count (five [21%] of 24), and vomiting (five [21%] of 24). Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation was the only dose-limiting toxicity and occurred in one patient without a TRK fusion and with progressive disease. No grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed. Two larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were observed: grade 3 nausea and grade 3 ejection fraction decrease during the 28-day follow-up after discontinuing larotrectinib and while on anthracyclines. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 100 mg/m2 (maximum of 100 mg per dose) was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response.

This study aimed to assess the safety of larotrectinib in paediatric patients.METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study was done at eight sites in the USA and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion status; had a Karnofsky (≥16 years of age) or Lansky (<16 years of age) performance status score of 50 or more, adequate organ function, and full recovery from the acute toxic effects of all previous anticancer therapy. Following a protocol amendment on Sept 12, 2016, patients with locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma who would require disfiguring surgery to achieve a complete surgical resection were also eligible. Patients were enrolled to three dose cohorts according to a rolling six design. Larotrectinib was administered orally (capsule or liquid formulation), twice daily, on a continuous 28-day schedule, in increasing doses adjusted for age and bodyweight. The primary endpoint of the phase 1 dose escalation component was the safety of larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity. All patients who received at least one dose of larotrectinib were included in the safety analyses. Reported here are results of the phase 1 dose escalation cohort. Phase 1 follow-up and phase 2 are ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02637687.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2015, and April 13, 2017, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) with a median age of 4·5 years (IQR 1·3-13·3) were enrolled to three dose cohorts: cohorts 1 and 2 were assigned doses on the basis of both age and bodyweight predicted by use of SimCyp modelling to achieve an area under the curve equivalent to the adult doses of 100 mg twice daily (cohort 1) and 150 mg twice daily (cohort 2); and cohort 3 was assigned to receive a dose of 100 mg/m2 twice daily (maximum 100 mg per dose), regardless of age, equating to a maximum of 173% of the recommended adult phase 2 dose. Among enrolled patients harbouring TRK fusion-positive cancers, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2 (occurring in 21 [88%] of 24 patients); the most common larotrectinib-related adverse events of all grades were increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ten [42%] of 24 each), leucopenia (five [21%] of 24), decreased neutrophil count (five [21%] of 24), and vomiting (five [21%] of 24). Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation was the only dose-limiting toxicity and occurred in one patient without a TRK fusion and with progressive disease. No grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed. Two larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were observed: grade 3 nausea and grade 3 ejection fraction decrease during the 28-day follow-up after discontinuing larotrectinib and while on anthracyclines. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 100 mg/m2 (maximum of 100 mg per dose) was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.INTERPRETATION: The TRK inhibitor larotrectinib was well tolerated in paediatric patients and showed encouraging antitumour activity in all patients with TRK fusion-positive tumours. The recommended phase 2 dose was defined as 100mg/m2 (maximum 100 mg per dose) for infants, children, and adolescents, regardless of age.FUNDING: Loxo Oncology Inc.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), Merck's anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), received accelerated approval in May 2017 by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as having microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR). Shortly after, nivolumab (Opdivo), Bristol-Myers Squibb's anti-PD-1 mAb, gained an accelerated approval in August 2017 for adult and pediatric patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. These regulatory approvals marked an important milestone that a cancer treatment may be approved based on a common biomarker rather than the anatomic location in the body where the tumor originated, and therefore established a precedent for tumor type-agnostic therapy. In the 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meeting, larotrectinib (LOXO-101), Loxooncology's oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), demonstrated unprecedented efficacy on unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK)-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients. Both the anti-PD-1 mAbs and the TRK-targeting therapies share some basic features: (a) biomarker-based, well-defined rare patient population; (b) exceptionally high clinical efficacy, e.g., near 40% overall response rate (ORR) for pembrolizumab across 15 tumor types with MSI-H/dMMR and 75% ORR for larotrectinib across more than 12 tumor types with NTRK-fusion proteins; (c) durable responses lasting at least 6 months with complete responses observed; and (d) parallel development in adult and pediatric populations. With increasing accessibility to genetic analysis tools such as next-generation sequencing, tumor type-agnostic therapy has become a reality, both during clinical development and in clinical practice.

Activity against these acquired mutations was confirmed in enzyme and cell-based assays and in vivo tumor models. As clinical proof of concept, the first 2 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers who developed acquired resistance mutations on larotrectinib were treated with LOXO-195 on a first-in-human basis, utilizing rapid dose titration guided by pharmacokinetic assessments.

Recent consensus guidelines have provided recommendations for clinicians and laboratorians to better assist with interpretation of disease status and related CF mutations. The highly recommended Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR project should be the first resource in the evaluation of disease severity for CF mutations. Screen-positive newborns and patients with high clinical suspicion for CF are always recommended to undergo confirmatory sweat chloride testing with interpretations based on updated reference intervals.

We have developed a wearable sensor with an integrated salt bridge for real-time measurement of sweat chloride concentration. Here, in a proof-of-concept study, we compare the performance of the sensor to current clinical practice in CF patients and healthy subjects.METHOD: Sweat was induced on both forearms of 10 individuals with CF and 10 healthy subjects using pilocarpine iontophoresis. A Macroduct sweat collection device was attached to one arm and sweat was collected for 30 min and then sent for laboratory analysis. A sensor was attached to the other arm and the chloride ion concentration monitored in real time for 30 min using a Bluetooth transceiver and smart phone app.RESULTS: Stable sweat chloride measurements were obtained within 15 min following sweat induction using the wearable sensor. We define the detection time as the time at which the standard deviation of the real-time chloride ion concentration remained below 2 mEq/L for 5 min. The sweat volume for sensor measurements at the detection time was 13.1 ± 11.4 μL (SD), in many cases lower than the minimum sweat volume of 15 μL for conventional testing. The mean difference between sweat chloride concentrations measured by the sensor and the conventional laboratory practice was 6.2 ± 9.5 mEq/L (SD), close to the arm-to-arm variation of about 3 mEq/L. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two measurements was 0.97 highlighting the excellent agreement between the two methods.CONCLUSION: A wearable sensor can be used to make real-time measurements of sweat chloride within 15 min following sweat induction, requiring a small sweat volume, and with excellent agreement to standard methods.Copyright © 2018 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

This is because newborn screening started relatively recently, it is not performed everywhere, and even for individuals who were screened, there is the possibility of a false negative. To limit irreversible organ pathology, a timely diagnosis of CF and institution of CF therapies can greatly benefit these patients.STUDY DESIGN: Experts on CF diagnosis were convened at the 2015 CF Foundation Diagnosis Consensus Conference. The participants reviewed and discussed published works and instructive cases of CF diagnosis in individuals presenting with signs, symptoms, or a family history of CF. Through a modified Delphi methodology, several consensus statements were agreed upon. These consensus statements were updates of prior CF diagnosis conferences and recommendations.RESULTS: CF diagnosis in individuals outside of newborn screening relies on the clinical evidence and on evidence of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction. Clinical evidence can include typical organ pathologies seen in CF such as bronchiectasis or pancreatic insufficiency but often represent a broad range of severity including mild cases. CFTR dysfunction can be demonstrated using sweat chloride testing, CFTR molecular genetic analysis, or CFTR physiologic tests. On the basis of the large number of patients with bona fide CF currently followed in registries with sweat chloride levels between 30 and 40 mmol/L, the threshold considered \"intermediate\" was lowered from 40 mmol/L in the prior diagnostic guidelines to 30 mmol/L. The CF diagnosis was also discussed in the context of CFTR-related disorders in which CFTR dysfunction may be present, but the individual does not meet criteria for CF.CONCLUSIONS: CF diagnosis remains a rare but important condition that can be diagnosed when characteristic clinical features are seen in an individual with demonstrated CFTR dysfunction.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In order to test this hypothesis, we studied 230 patients homozygous for the DeltaF508 allele, and 34 patients with at least one allele associated with pancreatic sufficiency, born since January 1, 1955, who have pulmonary function data and sweat chloride concentrations recorded in our CF center database, and no culture positive for B. cepacia.

Herein we report the first characterization of the sweat metabolome from screen-positive CF infants and identify metabolites associated with disease status that complement sweat chloride testing. Pilocarpine-stimulated sweat specimens were collected independently from two CF clinics, including 50 unaffected infants (e.g., carriers) and 18 confirmed CF cases. Nontargeted metabolite profiling was performed using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry as a high throughput platform for analysis of polar/ionic metabolites in volume-restricted sweat samples. Amino acids, organic acids, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, purine derivatives, and unknown exogenous compounds were identified in sweat when using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, including metabolites associated with affected yet asymptomatic CF infants, such as asparagine and glutamine. Unexpectedly, a metabolite of pilocarpine, used to stimulate sweat secretion, pilocarpic acid, and a plasticizer metabolite from environmental exposure, mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalic acid, were secreted in the sweat of CF infants at significantly lower concentrations relative to unaffected CF screen-positive controls. These results indicated a deficiency in human paraoxonase, an enzyme unrelated to mutations to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and impaired chloride transport, which is a nonspecific arylesterase/lactonase known to mediate inflammation, bacterial biofilm formation, and recurrent lung infections in affected CF children later in life.

During the day, the blades of nyctinastic plant leaves (or leaflets) assume a more or less horizontal position that optimises their ability to capture sunlight for photosynthesis. At night, the positions that the leaf blades assume, regardless of whether they arise by rising, falling or twisting, are essentially vertical. Among the ideas put forth to explain the raison d'être of foliar nyctinasty are that it: (i) improves the temperature relations of plants; (ii) helps remove surface water from foliage; (iii) prevents the disruption of photoperiodism by moonlight; and (iv) directly discourages insect herbivory. After discussing these previous hypotheses, a novel tritrophic hypothesis is introduced that proposes that foliar nyctinasty constitutes an indirect plant defence against nocturnal herbivores. It is suggested that the reduction in physical clutter that follows from nocturnal leaf closure may increase the foraging success of many types of animals that prey upon or parasitise herbivores. Predators and parasitoids generally use some combination of visual, auditory or olfactory cues to detect prey. In terrestrial environments, it is hypothesised that the vertical orientation of the blades of nyctinastic plants at night would be especially beneficial to flying nocturnal predators (e.g. bats and owls) and parasitoids whose modus operandi is death from above. The movements of prey beneath a plant with vertically oriented foliage would be visually more obvious to gleaning or swooping predators under nocturnal or crepuscular conditions. Such predators could also detect sounds made by prey better without baffling layers of foliage overhead to damp and disperse the signal. Moreover, any volatiles released by the prey would diffuse more directly to the awaiting olfactory apparatus of the predators or parasitoids. In addition to facilitating the demise of herbivores by carnivores and parasitoids, foliar nyctinasty, much like the enhanced illumination of the full moon, may mitigate feeding by nocturnal herbivores by altering their foraging behaviour. Foliar nyctinasty could also provide a competitive advantage by encouraging herbivores, seeking more cover, to forage on or around non-nyctinastic species. As an added advantage, foliar nyctinasty, by decreasing the temperature between plants through its effects on re-radiation, may slow certain types of ectothermic herbivores making them more vulnerable to predation. Foliar nyctinasty also may not solely be a behavioural adaptation against folivores; by discouraging foraging by granivores, the inclusive fitness of nyctinastic plants may be increased."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "We found that nyctinasty is controlled by a periodic change of the internal concentration of leaf-opening and leaf-closing substances in the plant body.", "answer_start": 112}], "question": "What is nyctinasty in plants?", "id": "5c54d1a207647bbc4b000007_005", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Periodic leaf-movement of legumes is called nyctinasty and has been known since the age of Alexander the Great.

We therefore examined the optimal Bayesian response-adaptive strategy for allocating patients to donors and formulated a computationally tractable myopic heuristic.

Patients were prospectively followed both clinically and with stool assessments for 8 weeks post FMT. Assessments occurred at 1 week and 4 weeks post FMT to assess for failure. Failure was defined as presence of diarrhoeal symptoms and a positive CDI stool test by polymerase chain reaction for toxin gene (PCR) at any time point during the 8-week follow-up period. CDI stool testing using PCR was performed at weeks 1 and 4 post FMT in asymptomatic patients as well.RESULTS: 167 patients were included. Twenty-eight patients (16.7% (28/167)) were FMT failures throughout the 8-week period. At week 1, seven patients had already failed the FMT. Of the remaining 160 patients, 144 were asymptomatic, and among these, 141 were negative for C. difficile toxin gene by PCR. This resulted in an asymptomatic carriage rate of 2.1% (3/144).

Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been successfully used to treat recurrent C. difficile infection. It is hypothesized that FMT aids in recovery of a microbiota capable of colonization resistance to C. difficile. However, it is not fully understood how this occurs. Here we investigated changes in the fecal microbiota structure following FMT in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, and imputed a hypothetical functional profile based on the 16S rRNA profile using a predictive metagenomic tool. Increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased abundance of Proteobacteria were observed following FMT. The fecal microbiota of recipients following transplantation was more diverse and more similar to the donor profile than the microbiota prior to transplantation. Additionally, we observed differences in the imputed metagenomic profile. In particular, amino acid transport systems were overrepresented in samples collected prior to transplantation. These results suggest that functional changes accompany microbial structural changes following this therapy. Further identification of the specific community members and functions that promote colonization resistance may aid in the development of improved treatment methods for C. difficile infection.IMPORTANCE: Within the last decade, Clostridium difficile infection has surpassed other bacterial infections to become the leading cause of nosocomial infections. Antibiotic use, which disrupts the gut microbiota and its capability in providing colonization resistance against C. difficile, is a known risk factor in C. difficile infection. In particular, recurrent C. difficile remains difficult to treat with standard antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has provided a successful treatment method for some patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, but its mechanism and long-term effects remain unknown.

Since then many other ALK inhibitors have been developed (ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib,etc) and the treatment paradigm of these patients has considerably drifted. The questions regarding their treatment at progression remains unanswered at the moment.OBJECTIVE: Our review clarifies what it is the state of the art in the treatment of ALK rearranged NSCLC patients, highlights the mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance mutations and suggests a treatment algorithm based on specific primary resistance or acquired mutations.EVIDENCE REVIEW: Studies that enrolled ALK+ NSCLC patients with locally advance or metastatic disease receiving treatment with ALK inhibitor, first or second line, were identified using electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library). Trials were excluded if they were phase 1, enrolled less than 10 patients.FINDING: Overall 1942 patients were included in our review. It confirms the role and the efficacy in first line of Alectinib but it highlights also that all the ALK inhibitors could play a crucial role during the patients' journey. Identifying the different mutations and utilising the most active ALK inhibitor depending on the \"up-to-date\" driven mutation is the way forward in the management of those patients.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: the review shows the rapid drifting in the management of ALK+ NSCLC patients and the importance of fully understanding and acknowledging the role of the resistance mutation, primary or acquired. We strongly advocate a comprehensive genomic approach in the management of ALK+ NSCLC patients who develop resistance mutations that are still targetable by a different ALK inhibitor.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To determine tissue-plasma concordance, we compared plasma findings to results of repeat biopsies.Results: At progression, we detected an ALK fusion in plasma from 19 (86%) of 22 patients, and identified ALK resistance mutations in plasma specimens from 11 (50%) patients. There was 100% agreement between tissue- and plasma-detected ALK fusions.

However, clinical outcomes in these patients vary, and the benefit of TKIs is limited as a result of acquired resistance. Emerging data suggest that the ALK fusion variant may affect clinical outcome, but the molecular basis for this association is unknown. Patients and Methods We identified 129 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with known ALK variants. ALK resistance mutations and clinical outcomes on ALK TKIs were retrospectively evaluated according to ALK variant. A Foundation Medicine data set of 577 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC was also examined. Results The most frequent ALK variants were EML4-ALK variant 1 in 55 patients (43%) and variant 3 in 51 patients (40%). We analyzed 77 tumor biopsy specimens from patients with variants 1 and 3 who had progressed on an ALK TKI. ALK resistance mutations were significantly more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (57% v 30%; P = .023). In particular, ALK G1202R was more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (32% v 0%; P < .001). Analysis of the Foundation Medicine database revealed similar associations of variant 3 with ALK resistance mutation and with G1202R ( P = .010 and .015, respectively).

In vitro, human ABCB1 and mouse Abcg2 modestly transported lorlatinib.

Lorlatinib plasma levels were not altered. Oral coadministration of the ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar increased the brain accumulation of lorlatinib in wild-type mice fourfold, that is, to the same level as in Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2-/- mice, without altering plasma exposure. Similar results were obtained for lorlatinib testis accumulation. In Cyp3a-/- mice, the plasma exposure of lorlatinib was increased 1.3-fold, but was then twofold reduced upon transgenic overexpression of human CYP3A4 in liver and intestine, whereas relative tissue distribution of lorlatinib remained unaltered.

This hypothesis suggests a compromised oral hygiene leads to a dysbiotic oral microbiome whereby Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone periodontal pathogen, with its companion species, orchestrates immune subversion in the host. Brushing and chewing on teeth supported by already injured soft tissues leads to bacteremias. As a result, a persistent systemic inflammatory response develops to periodontal pathogens. The pathogens, and the host's inflammatory response, subsequently lead to the initiation and progression of multiple metabolic and inflammatory co-morbidities, including AD. Insufficient levels of essential micronutrients can lead to microbial dysbiosis through the growth of periodontal pathogens such as demonstrated for P. gingivalis under low hemin bioavailability. An individual's diet also defines the consortium of microbial communities that take up residency in the oral and gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiomes. Their imbalance can lead to behavioral changes. For example, probiotics enriched in Lactobacillus genus of bacteria, when ingested, exert some anti-inflammatory influence through common host/bacterial neurochemicals, both locally, and through sensory signaling back to the brain. Early life dietary behaviors may cause an imbalance in the host/microbial endocrinology through a dietary intake incompatible with a healthy GI tract microbiome later in life. This imbalance in host/microbial endocrinology may have a lasting impact on mental health.

Treatment was initiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received the 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a 2-point decline in the score on the motor and language domains of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale (which ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 representing no function and 3 representing normal function in each of the two domains), which was compared with the time until a 2-point decline in 42 historical controls. We also compared the rate of decline in the motor-language score between the two groups, using data from baseline to the last assessment with a score of more than 0, divided by the length of follow-up (in units of 48 weeks).RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled, 23 of whom constituted the efficacy population.

Newer HMAs, less susceptible to in-vivo deamination, such as guadecitabine or ASTX727 have shown activity. Alterations of immune checkpoints in MDS have led to multiple clinical trials evaluating the activity of monoclonal antibodies targeting these proteins (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab).

Ivosidenib (AG-120) is an oral, targeted, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH1.METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ivosidenib monotherapy in IDH1-mutated AML. Safety and efficacy were assessed in all treated patients. The primary efficacy population included patients with relapsed or refractory AML receiving 500 mg of ivosidenib daily with at least 6 months of follow-up.RESULTS: Overall, 258 patients received ivosidenib and had safety outcomes assessed. Among patients with relapsed or refractory AML (179 patients), treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher that occurred in at least 3 patients were prolongation of the QT interval (in 7.8% of the patients), the IDH differentiation syndrome (in 3.9%), anemia (in 2.2%), thrombocytopenia or a decrease in the platelet count (in 3.4%), and leukocytosis (in 1.7%). In the primary efficacy population (125 patients), the rate of complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery was 30.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.5 to 39.3), the rate of complete remission was 21.6% (95% CI, 14.7 to 29.8), and the overall response rate was 41.6% (95% CI, 32.9 to 50.8). The median durations of these responses were 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 12.0), 9.3 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 18.3), and 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 9.3), respectively. Transfusion independence was attained in 29 of 84 patients (35%), and patients who had a response had fewer infections and febrile neutropenia episodes than those who did not have a response. Among 34 patients who had a complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery, 7 (21%) had no residual detectable IDH1 mutations on digital polymerase-chain-reaction assay. No preexisting co-occurring single gene mutation predicted clinical response or resistance to treatment.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced IDH1-mutated relapsed or refractory AML, ivosidenib at a dose of 500 mg daily was associated with a low frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events and with transfusion independence, durable remissions, and molecular remissions in some patients with complete remission.

Enasidenib (AG-221) is an allosteric inhibitor that binds to the IDH2 dimer interface and blocks the production of 2HG by IDH2 mutants9,10. In a phase I/II clinical trial, enasidenib inhibited the production of 2HG and induced clinical responses in relapsed or refractory IDH2-mutant AML11. Here we describe two patients with IDH2-mutant AML who had a clinical response to enasidenib followed by clinical resistance, disease progression, and a recurrent increase in circulating levels of 2HG. We show that therapeutic resistance is associated with the emergence of second-site IDH2 mutations in trans, such that the resistance mutations occurred in the IDH2 allele without the neomorphic R140Q mutation. The in trans mutations occurred at glutamine 316 (Q316E) and isoleucine 319 (I319M), which are at the interface where enasidenib binds to the IDH2 dimer. The expression of either of these mutant disease alleles alone did not induce the production of 2HG; however, the expression of the Q316E or I319M mutation together with the R140Q mutation in trans allowed 2HG production that was resistant to inhibition by enasidenib. Biochemical studies predicted that resistance to allosteric IDH inhibitors could also occur via IDH dimer-interface mutations in cis, which was confirmed in a patient with acquired resistance to the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120).

The LAL assay was optimized leading to both LC-MS/MS and fluorometric assay of LAL. We tested the new assay on DBS from healthy and LAL-deficient patients.RESULTS: The ester formed between palmitic acid and 4-propyl-8-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (P-PMHC) was found to be >98% selective for LAL in DBS based on the sensitivity of its activity to the LAL-specific inactivator Lalistat-2 and the fact that the activity was close to zero using DBS from patients previously shown to be LAL-deficient. Use of P-PMHC and heavy isotope-labeled internal standard with optimized assay conditions led to an approximately 2-fold increase in the specific activity of LAL compared with the previously reported LAL assay. Patients deficient in LAL were readily distinguished from normal persons with the new LAL assay using UPLC-MS/MS or fluorometric assay platforms.CONCLUSIONS: The new assay can measure LAL in DBS with a single measurement compared with the previous method involving 2 assays done in parallel.© 2017 American Association for Clinical Chemistry."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "BACKGROUND: Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease with a wide range of severity from Wolman Disease to Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease.

Recently enzyme replacement therapy with sebelipase alpha has been approved by drug agencies for treatment of this lysosomal disease. Ezetimibe is an azetidine derivative which blocks Niemann Pick C1-Like 1 Protein; as its consequence, plasmatic concentration of low density lipoproteins and other apoB-containing lipoproteins, that are the substrate of lysosomal acid lipase, are decreased. Furthermore, ezetimibe acts by blocking inflammasome activation which is the cause of liver fibrosis in steatohepatitis and in lysosomal storage diseases.RESULTS: Two patients with Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease were treated with ezetimibe for 9 years and a third patients for 10 years. Treatment was supplemented with low dose of atorvastatin in the first two patients during the last 6 years. All patients showed a significant reduction of alanine aminotransferase, cholesterol and triglyceride.

The training set comprised 1018 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC from January 2000 through December 2013 at 3 tertiary centers in Italy. The validation set comprised 341 consecutive patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC during the same period at the Liver Cancer Institute in Shanghai, China. We collected pretransplantation data on etiology of liver disease, number and size of tumors, patient level of α-fetoprotein (AFP), model for end-stage liver disease score, tumor stage, numbers and types of treatment, response to treatments, tumor grade, microvascular invasion, dates, and causes of death. Death was defined as HCC-specific when related to HCC recurrence after transplantation, disseminated extra- and/or intrahepatic tumor relapse and worsened liver function in presence of tumor spread.

In the validation set, the model identified patients who survived 5 years after liver transplantation with 0.721 accuracy (95% confidence interval, 0.648%-0.793%).

Additionally, 40 HCC and 40 CC patients who were randomly selected from the same period served as a control group. Images were classified as HCC-like or CC-like pattern according to CEUS guidelines recommended by World and European Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB-EFSUMB). The diagnostic criteria of CHC were defined as follows: (1) both AFP and CA19-9 are simultaneously elevated (AFP > 20 ng/ml and CA19-9 > 100 units/ml); or (2) elevated AFP with a CC-like pattern on CEUS and without elevated CA19-9 level; or (3) elevated CA19-9 with an HCC-like pattern on CEUS and without elevated AFP level. The diagnostic tests were performed with calculation of the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).RESULTS: For the 40 CHC patients, the rates of elevated AFP and CA19-9 serology were 55.0 and 30.0%, respectively. Twenty-three (57.5%) patients exhibited an HCC-like pattern, and 15 (37.5%) showed a CC-like pattern.

In particular, cardiolipin (CL) has been shown to stimulate tBID-induced BAX activation in vitro. However, it is still unclear whether this process also relies on CL in the cell, or whether it is more dependent on MTCH2, a proposed receptor for tBID present in the MOM. To address this issue, we deleted both alleles of cardiolipin synthase in human HCT116 cells by homologous recombination, which resulted in a complete absence of CL. The CL-deficient cells were fully viable in glucose but displayed impaired oxidative phosphorylation and an inability to grow in galactose. Using these cells, we found that CL was not required for either tBID-induced BAX activation, or for apoptosis in response to treatment with TRAIL.

Methods In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, 577 adults with episodic migraine were randomized to placebo or 70 mg erenumab; 570 patients were included in efficacy analyses. Primary endpoint was change in monthly migraine days. Secondary endpoints were ≥50% reduction in monthly migraine days, change in acute migraine-specific medication treatment days, and ≥5-point reduction in Physical Impairment and Impact on Everyday Activities domain scores measured by the Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary. All endpoints assessed change from baseline at month 3. Results Patients receiving erenumab experienced -2.9 days change in monthly migraine days, compared with -1.8 days for placebo, least-squares mean (95% CI) treatment difference of -1.0 (-1.6, -0.5) ( p < 0.001). A ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine days was achieved by 39.7% (erenumab) and 29.5% (placebo) of patients (OR:1.59 (95% CI: 1.12, 2.27) ( p = 0.010). Migraine-specific medication treatment days were reduced by -1.2 (erenumab) and -0.6 (placebo) days, a treatment difference of -0.6 (-1.0, -0.2) ( p = 0.002). The ≥5-point reduction rates in Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary - Physical Impairment were 33.0% and 27.1% (OR:1.33 (0.92, 1.90) ( p = 0.13) and in Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary - Everyday Activities were 40.4% and 35.8% (OR:1.22 (0.87, 1.71) ( p = 0.26). Safety and adverse event profiles of erenumab were similar to placebo. Most frequent adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection, injection site pain, and nasopharyngitis.

Response was defined as resolution of diarrhea and recurrence was defined by recurrence of CDI within 8 weeks of the end of treatment.RESULTS: Overall, 81 patients (median age 55.9 y; 53% female; 26% with inflammatory bowel disease) were included. Response occurred in 90%. Responders had fewer prior CDI episodes [median 1 (range, 0 to 8)] than nonresponders [median 2.5 (range, 1 to 8)], P=0.01. Response after a first CDI episode was 100%, 96% after 1 prior episode, and 82% after 2 or more, P=0.02. Recurrence occurred in 19%.

The present study investigated the effects of safinamide on the development of LID in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats, evaluating behavioral, molecular, and neurochemical parameters associated with LID appearance. 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were treated with saline, levodopa (6 mg/kg), or levodopa plus safinamide (15 mg/kg) for 21 days. Abnormal involuntary movements, motor performance, molecular composition of the striatal glutamatergic synapse, glutamate, and GABA release were analyzed. In the striatum, safinamide prevented the rearrangement of the subunit composition of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and the levodopa-induced increase of glutamate release associated with dyskinesia without affecting the levodopa-stimulated motor performance and dyskinesia.

To this aim, in vivo microdialysis was used to monitor the spontaneous and veratridine-induced Glu and GABA release in the hippocampus and basal ganglia of naive, awake rats. Brain levels of safinamide were measured as well. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the effect of safinamide, sodium currents were measured by patch-clamp recording in rat cortical neurons. Safinamide maximally inhibited the veratridine-induced Glu and GABA release in hippocampus at 15 mg/kg, which reached free brain concentrations of 1.89-1.37 µM. This dose attenuated veratridine-stimulated Glu (but not GABA) release in subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra reticulata, but not in striatum. Safinamide was ineffective on spontaneous neurotransmitter release. In vitro, safinamide inhibited sodium channels, showing a greater affinity at depolarized (IC50 = 8 µM) than at resting (IC50 = 262 µM) potentials. We conclude that safinamide inhibits in vivo Glu release from stimulated nerve terminals, likely via blockade of sodium channels at subpopulations of neurons with specific firing patterns.

However, the molecular consequences of reduced PHF21A expression remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) two patient-derived cell lines with heterozygous loss of PHF21A compared to unaffected individuals and identified 1,885 genes that were commonly misregulated. The patient cells displayed down-regulation of key pathways relevant to learning and memory, including Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP)-signaling pathway genes. We found that PHF21A is required for full induction of a luciferase reporter carrying cAMP-responsive elements (CRE) following stimulation by the cAMP analog, forskolin. Finally, PHF21A-deficient patient-derived cells exhibited a delayed induction of immediate early genes following forskolin stimulation.

H9C2 cells were treated with TNF-α with or without vaspin in vitro. Tumor necrosis factor-α treatment inhibited autophagy and promoted apoptosis in H9C2 cells after stimulating for 24 hours. Pretreatment with vaspin significantly mitigated apoptosis induced by TNF-α partly because of augment effects of vaspin on autophagy as demonstrated by a higher ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, higher expression of Beclin-1, and increased autophagosomes formation. Furthermore, the AKT agonist IGF-1 significantly reversed the effect of vaspin on autophagy. In vivo DCM model was also developed by treating rats with streptozotocin followed by intraperitoneal injection with vaspin.

The interaction involves the inter-LIM domain, amino acids 94 to 105, of MLP and the amino-terminal domain, amino acids 1 to 105, of CFL2, which includes part of the actin depolymerization domain. The MLP/CFL2 complex is stronger in moderately acidic (pH 6.8) environments and upon CFL2 phosphorylation, while it is independent of Ca(2+) levels. This interaction has direct implications in actin cytoskeleton dynamics in regulating CFL2-dependent F-actin depolymerization, with maximal depolymerization enhancement at an MLP/CFL2 molecular ratio of 2:1. Deregulation of this interaction by intracellular pH variations, CFL2 phosphorylation, MLP or CFL2 gene mutations, or expression changes, as observed in a range of cardiac and skeletal myopathies, could impair F-actin depolymerization, leading to sarcomere dysfunction and disease."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": " human intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2 gene (FABP2) ", "answer_start": 15}], "question": "Where is fatty acid binding protein 2 expressed?", "id": "5c8d15cf0101eac870000009_001", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Variants of the human intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2 gene (FABP2) are associated with traits of the metabolic syndrome.

In accordance, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), transcriptional factors GATA-5 and -6 bind with higher binding affinities to the FABP2 promoter region containing the -80A allele compared to B. As functional consequence, haplotype A is twice as much more activated by GATA factors than haplotype B in liver Huh7 cells.

The disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the DCAF17 gene. The purpose of this study was to describe the spectrum of brain MR imaging abnormalities in Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed brain MR images of 26 patients with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (12 males, 14 females; age range, 16-45 years; mean age, 26.6 years). Follow-up studies were conducted for 6 patients.RESULTS: All patients had abnormal MR imaging findings. The most common abnormalities were a small pituitary gland (76.9%), pronounced basal ganglia iron deposition (73%), and white matter lesions in 69.2%. White matter lesions showed frontoparietal and periventricular predominance. All white matter lesions spared subcortical U-fibers and were nonenhanced. Prominent perivascular spaces (15.3%) and restricted diffusion in the splenium of the corpus callosum (7.6%) were less frequent findings. Follow-up studies showed expansion of white matter lesions with iron deposition further involving the red nucleus and substantia nigra. Older age was associated with a more severe degree of white matter lesions (P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Small pituitary gland, accentuated iron deposition in the globus pallidus, and nonenhancing frontoparietal/periventricular white matter lesions were the most noted abnormalities seen in our cohort. The pattern and extent of these findings were observed to correlate with older age, reflecting a possible progressive myelin destruction and/or axonal loss. The presence of pituitary hypoplasia and white matter lesions can further distinguish Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome from other neurodegenerative diseases with brain iron accumulation subtypes.© 2018 by American Journal of Neuroradiology."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Sequence variants in the gene DCAF17, encoding nucleolar substrate receptor, were identified as the underlying cause of inherited WSS.", "answer_start": 229}], "question": "Which gene mutation is associated with Woodhouse Sakati syndrome?", "id": "5c72f5247c78d6947100007e_004", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Woodhouse Sakati syndrome (WSS, MIM 241080) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition characterized by alopecia, hypogonadism, hearing impairment, diabetes mellitus, learning disabilities and extrapydamidal manifestations.

For the efficacy outcomes, results did show that participants taking losigamone were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.72), but associated with a significant increase of treatment withdrawal when compared with those taking placebo (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.67). For the safety outcomes, results indicated that the proportion of participants who experienced adverse events in the losigamone group was higher than in the placebo group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.80), dizziness was the only adverse event significantly reported in relation to losigamone (RR 3.82, 99% CI 1.69 to 8.64). The proportion of participants achieving seizure freedom was not reported in either trial report. A subgroup analysis according to different doses of losigamone showed that a higher dose of losigamone (1500 mg/day) was associated with a greater reduction in seizure frequency than lower doses, but was also associated with more dropouts due to adverse events.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review showed that losigamone did reduce seizure frequency but was associated with more treatment withdrawals when used as an add-on therapy for people with focal epilepsy.

A variety of agents that act at GABAARs s are used to terminate or prevent seizures. Many act at distinct receptor sites determined by the subunit composition of the holoreceptor. For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and loreclezole, actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, losigamone and stiripentol, GABAAR modulation is one of several possible antiseizure mechanisms. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite that enhances GABAAR function, led to the development of ganaxolone. Other agents modulate GABAergic \"tone\" by regulating the synthesis, transport or breakdown of GABA. GABAAR efficacy is also affected by the transmembrane chloride gradient, which changes during development and in chronic epilepsy. This may provide an additional target for \"GABAergic\" ASDs. GABAAR subunit changes occur both acutely during status epilepticus and in chronic epilepsy, which alter both intrinsic GABAAR function and the response to GABAAR-acting ASDs. Manipulation of subunit expression patterns or novel ASDs targeting the altered receptors may provide a novel approach for seizure prevention."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "In recent years, many newer antiepileptic drugs have been investigated as add-on therapy for partial epilepsy; losigamone is one of these drugs and is the focus of this systematic review.", "answer_start": 278}], "question": "Losigamone can be used for treatment of which disease?", "id": "5c73acec7c78d69471000086_011", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurologic disorder, affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide; nearly a third of these people are not well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug and usually require treatment with a combination of two or more antiepileptic drugs.

Epilepsy describes a group of brain disorders whose symptoms and causes are diverse and complicated, but all share a common behavioural manifestation: the seizure. Seizures result from the abnormal discharge of groups of neurons within the brain, usually within a focal point, that can result in the recruitment of large brain regions into epileptiform activity. Although the range of explanations for the development of seizures can be as varied as genetic composition to acute head trauma, the net result is often similar. The excitability of neurons is governed by the input they receive from their neighbours and the intrinsic excitability of the neuron. In this review we focus on elements that are crucial to determining the intrinsic excitability of neurons in the CNS, the voltage gated ion channels (VGICs). VGICs as well as being important for physiological function are critical in producing hyperexcitability such as that associated with seizure discharges. Many drugs routinely used in the clinical setting, as well as several novel experimental drugs, have shown interactions with VGICs that underpin, at least in part, their anticonvulsant action. We review the physiological roles of voltage gated ion channels that are selective for sodium, potassium and calcium conductance and attempt to highlight their role in the pathology of epilepsy. This is supplemented by the mechanisms of drug action at these important anticonvulsant targets for classical and clinically relevant compounds (e.g. phenytoin, ethosuximide) as well as some important second generation drugs (e.g. gabapentin, levetiracetam) and novel experimental agents (e.g. retigabine, losigamone, safinamide).

All subjects received a single dose of 200 mg losigamone (1 tablet) in period 1 (on day 14) as well as multiple doses of losigamone (3 tablets = 600 mg per day) or placebo for 15 days in periods 2 and 3. During all three periods an oral contraceptive containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol and 150 microg levonorgestrel was given. Single-dose pharmacokinetics was investigated on day 14 of period 1. Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic investigations were performed on day 15 of periods 2 and 3. The samples were assayed to derive pharmacokinetic data of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. In addition, the concentrations of losigamone racemate (AO-33) and its enantiomers AO-242 and AO-294 were determined in these samples.RESULTS: The mean values of the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC and Cmax of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel after multiple-dose treatment with losigamone or placebo were quite similar and met the criteria for bioequivalence. The 90% confidence intervals of the log-transformed ratios of the geometric means of the primary pharmacokinetic variables were included in the respective acceptance ranges of 80% to 125% (AUC) and 70% to 143% (Cmax).CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that multiple doses of losigamone did not influence the multiple dose kinetics of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. The single- and multiple-dose kinetics of 200 mg losigamone and its enantiomeres did not differ from each other in a significant way.

These patients require more than one antiepileptic drug. In animal models of epilepsy, it is possible to determine which combinations produce supra-additive anticonvulsive effects with minimal or even no adverse reactions. The experimental data can be helpful for predicting effective drug combinations in patients with refractory epilepsy. Losigamone is a new antiepileptic drug with an unknown mechanism of action. The drug belongs to the group of beta-methoxy-butenolides, and exists as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (AO-242 and AO-294). The drug is eliminated by oxidation. Cytochrome CYP2A6 appears to be the main isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism of losigamone. In vitro, losigamone exerts anticonvulsant activity in the picrotoxin model in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas, the low Ca(2+) model in CA1 area and the low Mg(2+) model in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In vivo, the drug exhibits significant efficacy against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in rodents and pentetrazole-induced clonic convulsions in mice. Potency of losigamone varies with the respective seizure test, animal species used in experiments and route of drug administration. Toxicity studies do not indicate any teratogenic risk of the drug, at least in animals.

Thus, this enzyme stands out as a new key molecular target for parasites causing Neglected Diseases (NDs). Focused on contributing to the development of new therapeutic alternatives for NDs, in this study, for the first time, a screening of 57 natural products for in vitro inhibition of Leishmania major DHODH (LmDHODH) was carried out, including cross validation against the human DHODH (HsDHODH). A subset of natural products consisting of 21 sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) was submitted to QSAR studies. Additionally, thermostability studies by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) were performed to determine whether the STLs are effectively or not binding to the enzyme. The IC50 values against LmDHODH varied from 27 to 1200 μM; only irrelevant inhibition was obtained on HsDHODH. DSF assays confirmed binding of STLs to LmDHODH; moreover, it is suggested that such inhibitors might act in a different site other than the active site. A reliable QSAR model based on molecular descriptors was obtained (R2: 0.83; Q2CV: 0.69 and Q2EXT/F2: 0.66) indicating that stronger inhibition requires a balanced distribution of the hydrophobic regions across the molecular surface, as well as higher width and lower hydrophobicity of the molecules. A pharmacophore-based 3D-QSAR approach also afforded a useful model (R2: 0.72; Q2CV: 0.50 and Q2EXT/F2: 0.62), which confirmed the importance of proper orientation of the ligands, molecular surface features and shape for stronger inhibition, reflecting properties of a putative common binding site. These data indicated for the first time that natural products can actually inhibit LmDHODH and highlighted some metabolites as potentially interesting starting points for the discovery of more potent LmDHODH inhibitors, ultimately aiming at new effective therapeutic alternatives for leishmaniasis and, possibly, other NDs caused by trypanosomatids."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (HsDHODH) is a key enzyme of pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis pathway", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is a drug target and is involved in what biosynthetic pathway", "id": "5cb0856decadf2e73f000058_002", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (HsDHODH) is a key enzyme of pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis pathway.

And two domains were involved in the Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase amino acid sequence of silkworms, Bombyx mori (BmDHODH), namely a DHO_dh domain and a transmembrane domain in N-termina. The silkworm dhod is expressed throughout development and in nine tissues. Moreover, knockdown of the silkworm dhod gene reduced cell growth and proliferation through G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Similarly, DHODH inhibitor (leflunomide) also reduced cell growth and proliferation, with a significant decrease of cyclin B and cdk2. DHODH is the fourth enzyme of pyrimidine synthesis, so we also found that leflunomide can inhibit, at least in part, the endomitotic DNA replication in silk glands cells.

Their function is strongly linked to sperm head morphology and male fertility. Protamines appear to be affected by a complex pattern of selective constraints. Previous studies showed that sexual selection affects protamine coding sequence and expression in rodents. Here we analyze selective constraints and post-copulatory sexual selection acting on protamine 2 (Prm2) gene sequences of 53 species of primates and rodents. We focused on possible differences in selective constraints between these two clades and on the two functional domains of PRM2 (cleaved- and mature-PRM2). We also assessed if and how changes in Prm2 coding sequence may affect sperm head dimensions.RESULTS: The domain of Prm2 that is cleaved off during binding to DNA (cleaved-Prm2) was found to be under purifying selection in both clades, whereas the domain that remains bound to DNA (mature-Prm2) was found to be positively selected in primates and under relaxed constraint in rodents. Changes in cleaved-Prm2 coding sequence are significantly correlated to sperm head width and elongation in rodents. Contrary to expectations, a significant effect of sexual selection was not found on either domain or clade.CONCLUSIONS: Mature-PRM2 may be free to evolve under less constraint due to the existence of PRM1 as a more conserved and functionally redundant copy. The cleaved-PRM2 domain seems to play an important role in sperm head shaping.

Histological examination showed no evidence of re-establishment of spermatogenesis in autografts, and progressive degeneration of seminiferous tubules was detected. Expression of germ cell-specific proteins such as POU5F1, DAZL, TNP1, TNP2, PRM1 and PRM2 revealed that, although proliferating and differentiating spermatogenic germ cells such as spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids could survive in autografts until 4 weeks, only terminally differentiated germ cells such as sperm persisted in autografts until 8 weeks. The presence of Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells, as indicated by expression of WT1 and ACTA2 proteins, respectively, was evident in the autografts until 8 weeks. Interestingly, seminal vesicle weight and serum testosterone level were restored in autografted mice by 8 weeks post grafting.

Abnormal protamination may result in insufficient condensation in the sperm nucleus, thus rendering paternal DNA susceptible to damage, which could have detrimental consequences upon embryogenesis. Consequently, it is imperative that Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) endeavour to utilise sperm devoid of protamine abnormalities, especially because retained histones are present in imprinted gene clusters.

The transfer of the isolated mitochondria can be followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal imaging using mitochondria vital dyes. The use of mitochondria donor and target cells with distinct haplotypes (SNPs) also allows detection of the transferred mitochondria based on the concentration of their circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the target cells.

Patients with the infantile form of Krabbe disease can be treated at a presymptomatic stage with human stem cell transplantation which improves survival and clinical outcomes. However, without a family history, most cases of infantile Krabbe disease present after onset of symptoms and are ineligible for transplantation. In 2006, New York began screening newborns for Krabbe disease to identify presymptomatic cases. To ensure that those identified with infantile disease received timely treatment, New York public health and medical systems took steps to accurately diagnose and rapidly refer infants for human stem cell transplantation within the first few weeks of life. After 11 years of active screening in New York and the introduction of Krabbe disease newborn screening in other states, new information has been gained which can inform the design of newborn screening programs to improve infantile Krabbe disease outcomes.FINDINGS: Recent information relevant to Krabbe disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment were assessed by a diverse group of public health, medical, and advocacy professionals. Outcomes after newborn screening may improve if treatment for infantile disease is initiated before 30 days of life. Newer laboratory screening and diagnostic tools can improve the speed and specificity of diagnosis and help facilitate this early referral. Given the rarity of Krabbe disease, most recommendations were based on case series or expert opinion.CONCLUSION: This report updates recommendations for Krabbe disease newborn screening to improve the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment of infantile Krabbe disease. In the United States, several states have begun or are considering Krabbe disease newborn screening. These recommendations can guide public health laboratories on methodologies for screening and inform clinicians about the need to promptly diagnose and treat infantile Krabbe disease. The timing of the initial referral after newborn screening, the speed of diagnostic confirmation of infantile disease, and the transplantation center's experience and ability to rapidly respond to a suspected patient with newly diagnosed infantile Krabbe disease are critical for optimal outcomes."}]}, {"title": "factoid", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Because a mutation in CFL2 was identified in a family with nemaline myopathy, we performed sequence analysis of the gene and a novel homozygous missense mutation in exon 2 (c.19G>A, p.Val7Met) of CFL2 was identified in both siblings.

We discuss the difference between biomarkers that are the result of a chemical reaction (such as lipid peroxides or oxidized proteins that are a result of the reaction of molecules with reactive oxygen species) and those that represent the biological response to stress, such as the transcription factor NRF2 or inflammation and inflammatory cytokines.CRITICAL ISSUES: The high-throughput and holistic approaches to biomarker discovery used extensively in large-scale molecular epidemiological exposome are also discussed in the context of human exposure to environmental stressors.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: We propose to consider the role of biomarkers as signs and to distinguish between signs that are just indicators of biological processes and proxies that one can interact with and modify the disease process.

Existing primary immunodeficiency registries are tailored to transplantation outcomes and do not capture the breadth of safety and efficacy endpoints required by the EMA for the long-term monitoring of gene therapies. Furthermore, for extended monitoring of Strimvelis, the young age of children treated, small patient numbers, and broad geographic distribution of patients all increase the risk of loss to follow-up before sufficient data have been collected. Establishing individual investigator sites would be impractical and uneconomical owing to the small number of patients from each location receiving Strimvelis.RESULTS: An observational registry has been established to monitor the safety and effectiveness of Strimvelis in up to 50 patients over a minimum of 15 years. To address the potential challenges highlighted above, data will be collected by a single investigator site at Ospedale San Raffaele (OSR), Milan, Italy, and entered into the registry via a central electronic platform. Patients/families and the patient's local physician will also be able to submit healthcare information directly to the registry using a uniquely designed electronic platform. Data entry will be monitored by a Gene Therapy Registry Centre (funded by GlaxoSmithKline) who will ensure that necessary information is collected and flows between OSR, the patient/family and the patient's local healthcare provider.CONCLUSION: The Strimvelis registry sets a precedent for the safety monitoring of future gene therapies. A unique, patient-focused design has been implemented to address the challenges of long-term follow-up of patients treated with gene therapy for a rare disease. Strategies to ensure data completeness and patient retention in the registry will help fulfil pharmacovigilance requirements.

Leptin and adiponectin have been linked to the development of coronary heart disease and may be involved in the underlying biological mechanism of ischemic stroke. Resistin, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is predictive of atherosclerosis and poor clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke. The changes in serum levels of novel adipokines apelin, visfatin are also associated with acute ischemic stroke. These adipokines have been proposed as potential prognostic biomarkers of cardiovascular mortality/morbidity and therapeutic targets in patients with cardiometabolic diseases. In this article, we summarize the biologic role of the adipokines and discuss the link between dysfunctional adipose tissue and metabolic/inflammation imbalance, consequently endothelial damage, progression of atherosclerotic disease, and the occurrence of ischemic stroke."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Resistin is a recently discovered hormone that is exclusively expressed in adipose tissue.", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is resistin?", "id": "5c840782617e120c34000006_003", "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Resistin is a recently discovered hormone that is exclusively expressed in adipose tissue.

The concentration of octylphenol that increased resistin mRNA levels by 50% was approximately 100 nM within 6 h of treatment. The basal half-life of resistin mRNA induced by actinomycin D was lengthened by octylphenol treatment, suggesting that octylphenol decreases the rate of resistin mRNA degradation.

The basal half-life of resistin protein induced by cycloheximide was lengthened by octylphenol treatment, suggesting that octylphenol decreases the rate of resistin protein degradation. While octylphenol was shown to increase activities of the estrogen receptor (ER) and MEK1, signaling was demonstrated to be blocked by pretreatment with either ICI-182780 (an ERalpha antagonist) or U-0126 (a MEK1 inhibitor), in which both inhibitors prevented octylphenol-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK. These results imply that ERalpha and ERK are necessary for the octylphenol stimulation of resistin mRNA expression. Moreover, U-0126 antagonized the octylphenol-increased resistin protein expression and release. These data suggest that the way octylphenol signaling increases resistin protein levels is similar to that by which it increases resistin mRNA levels; it is likely mediated through an ERK-dependent pathway.

In the present study we investigated the effects of leptin administration on adipose resistin expression in insulin-resistant and obese ob/ob mice. We show that the expression of resistin mRNA and protein in adipose tissue is lower in ob/ob than in wild-type control mice, in agreement with the reduced adipocyte resistin mRNA level reported in several models of obesity. Leptin administration in ob/ob mice resulted in improvement of insulin sensitivity concomitant with a decrease in resistin gene expression. The lack of effect of leptin on resistin in db/db mice indicated that the leptin inhibitory action on resistin expression requires the long leptin receptor isoform. In addition, we demonstrated that the effect of leptin on resistin expression was centrally mediated. High-fat feeding in C57BL/6J wild-type mice, which is known to induce the development of obesity and insulin resistance, produced an increase in resistin expression.

This study investigated the mechanism of resistin upregulation and the role of Serca2a in its transcriptional suppression. We demonstrate that restoration of Ca2+ homeostasis in diabetic hearts, through normalization of Serca2a function genetically and pharmacologically, suppressed resistin expression via inhibition of NFATc. H9c2 myocytes stimulated with high-glucose concentration or Ca2+ time-dependently increased NFATc and resistin expression while addition of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM attenuated this effect. NFATc expression was enhanced in hearts from ob/ob diabetic and from cardiac-specific Serca2a-/- mice. Similarly, NFATc increased resistin expression in myocytes cultured in low glucose while the NFATc inhibitor VIVIT blocked glucose-induced resistin expression, suggesting that hyperglycemia/diabetes induces resistin expression possibly through NFATc activation. Interestingly, overexpression of Serca2a or VIVIT mitigated glucose-stimulated resistin and NFATc expression and enhanced AMPK activity, a downstream target of resistin signaling. NFATc direct activation of resistin was verified by resistin promoter luciferase activity and chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis. Interestingly, activation of Serca2a by a novel agonist, CDN1163, mirrored the effects of AAV9-Serca2a gene transfer on resistin expression and its promoter activity and AMPK signaling in diabetic mice.

Specifically, we explored whether resistin underlies acute anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Remarkably, doxorubicin (25mg/kg ip) led to a 4-fold induction of serum resistin levels in Hum-Retn mice. Moreover, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was greater in the Hum-Retn mice than in littermate controls not expressing human resistin (Retn(-/-)). Hum-Retn mice showed increased cardiac mRNA levels of inflammatory and cell adhesion genes compared with Retn(-/-) mice. Macrophages, but not cardiomyocytes, from Hum-Retn mice treated with doxorubicin in vitro showed dramatic induction of hRetn (human resistin) mRNA and protein expression. We also examined resistin levels in anthracycline-treated breast cancer patients with and without cardiotoxicity. Intriguingly, serum resistin levels in women undergoing anthracycline-containing chemotherapy increased significantly at 3 months and remained elevated at 6 months in those with subsequent cardiotoxicity. Further, elevation in resistin correlated with decline in ejection fraction in these women. These results suggest that elevated resistin is a biomarker of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and may contribute in the development of heart failure via its direct effects on macrophages.
